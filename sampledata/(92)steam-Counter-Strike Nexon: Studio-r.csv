1,bruh i can't open this already
2,"Probably not the best game to pour 1000 hours or $1000 into, but for a free game it's pretty fun. Basically a more robust Sven co-op that makes it easy to launch the different game modes. The prophunt mode is great, probably the best I've played, and the user-made scenarios remind me of Spore Galactic Adventures. 

Not a fantastic MMO or Competitive FPS because of player counts, but if you have a group of friends this is a great, free game to mess around with. Most of the stuff that's P2W pertains to the zombies mode, and even then, it's PvE and you can just play on the difficulties that don't require the P2W stuff. I haven't played much of the competitive modes, so I can't say much about that.

As far as Free games go, this one is lightweight, easy to install/get started, and is surprisingly fun as a Gmod or less finicky Sven co-op alternative to play with 4-5 friends. The game tries to do everything and it does a few things quite well, just be wary of the P2W elements. I would not recommend this to solo players whatsoever, though."

107,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

112,"It`s fine, but the devs are making it too much like anime, i mean weapons, anything.
For me, i would like the 2017 one, the animations, decoders, drops, the hype when something good drops, not like now
When i first get my Magnum Drill, i was overhyped, now, just like ""huh, nice"""
113,"Counter Strike with Anime Catgirls and Zombies.

Also a Gacha Game with a lot of microtransactions.

And somehow it's still on GoldSource. 

Honestly worth playing just to see how weird it is. Especially since it's free.

162,"Hello, I'll like to give some important notices about this game:

[h1] 1: [/h1]
Beware of the anti-cheat of this game, It leaves a open holes for hackers due to the insecurity of the anti-cheat.
XIGNCODE3 (the old anti-cheat Nexon used for FPS games) tracks your PC all the time for no reason what so ever,
Also, the encryption of this anti-cheat is crack-able to hackers, resulting in your personal information being sold or leaked,

[h1] 2: [/h1]
This game is filled with micro-transactions, but unlike CS:GO, it's not just cosmetics, these are OP weapons.
Generally, you'll gain these weapons by points or by real life currency,
Paid decoders are more valuable and give much rarer items than the point decoders and they don't have a purchase limit unlike point decoders, leading to more people wasting their money on more powerful gear.

[h1] 3: [/h1]
Your account can be wiped any time without any reversal or any compensation, Nexon is overall a greedy company and rarely will help with any financial support.
These wipes can be caused by server error or not agreeing to their ""new terms"" after a few days.

[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]
Please just buy Counter Strike 1.6, It will cost you less than this game and most of other Nexon games combined,"

167,"I think it's a LOT more cooler and better to play than in Global Offensive but it does have some weird stuff.

Let us start with positives, yeah?

It is pretty fun to play, with cool guns to use such as the Quantum Horizon, or a Guillotine that you can throw.  I like the models. They're a bit weird, but they look nice to look at. Other than when you're not playing Zombie Z, I think you'll have a great time with this game if you like cool characters and weapons to use, and a lot of zombies to fight, a lot of modes to play, Because, honestly playing modes other than Zombie Z here is fun and is less rage inducing. Which we'll get to.  Permanent stuff gotten from decoders is kind of worth it.. but which we'll also get to.

Now on to the bad stuff, yeah?

It's so annoying playing Zombie Z. I personally think Zombies need a buff, because you just keep getting knocked back by good human weapons.  
It is so annoying when sometimes, one slash with the zombie arm at close range does the job but other times, you think you are close, but you're not. Git Gud - but I don't think that would work either because of how good players are in this game.  It's like trying to deal with melee mechanics from the 90's whilst you're being shot at. In my opinion zombies need a buff. Why are items that expire are here? It's so sucky - but if Lady Luck's on your side then you'll get it Permanent!  But it is so annoying though. Most modes are entirely empty, and it's only a few which get played often. Earlier on, I had no problem trying to find a Human Scenario but later on there's nothing. Zero. I don't know if the players hate those modes if it's so empty, I wonder where's people playing all modes.

It is a good MMOFPS.. If you're willing to pay and enter the RNG cycle. If not it's still fun though. I recommend it to players who love killing zombies and love using the weapons they can get but the Zombie Z mode is annoying enough you might as well not play it."

296,"Counter Strike: Made in China

Now the ACTUAL review.
CSNZ is actually pretty good despite it being made in China.
But the problem is that the newcomers see all these cool weapons that other players have, and then they feel obligated to get them.
All the special weapons AREN'T important, you can have just as much fun with the default weapons as the special weapons

Now onto the modes
Zombie scenario is the best one by far.
With the football mode surprising not being the worst one, even though it complete trash, it's hella fun with friend's.
Zombie Files is the worst mode overall, You're better off playing any other mode ever.
Theres alot of different modes, some I haven't even played

Now onto ""Enhancing""
To be honest, I don't know how enhancing works, so I'm just gonna skip this part of the review

Now the Community made maps
I know this might seem like I'm talking mad shit over the community, which I am but that's because 90% of the maps are awful because the building system in the game if pretty limiting.
Either way I'm gonna talk shit over children in China that play this game

Point is, don't buy the special weapons, play Zombie Scenario, don't play the community maps

298,"I LIKE IT
"
299,1st time ive played this game about 6 years ago and this game was amazing. Now its need new graphic and skins. But its still a classic cs 1.6 zombie shooter. So I put this 7\10! If you need kill time* - its yours.
300,Trash game
301,"horrible game 
"
302,"does anyone remember this being like a shitty zombie wave defense game and you had to kill a bunch of different zombies and it had weird profile pictures 

I'm asking because i miss my old steam profile picture and i think this game was where i got it from lol 

i don't remember this being good or bad i remember playing it when i was like 11 or something no clue what i'd been playing or even how to play but i remember having fun at the time 

edit: this game is shit took 10 minutes to boot up lagged the entire time and i couldn't select shit DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GARBAGE"
303,:)
304,Good luck getting those achievements
305,Unbalance guns and pay to win. Just no.
306,This is from the viewers!
307,Really hard to get into and very pay2win but playing against bots and everything is really fun since you have an absurd ammount of weapons to choose from.
308,"I LOVE THIS GAME , LOVE THE CHARACTER <3"
309,"Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio was a game I greatly enjoyed years ago but with iffy, mostly empty servers, a grind for temporary guns or paying for permanent ones and then getting them enhanced, with how unbalanced large portions of this game are and finally how near unobtainable most of the achievements are CSNS is just not feel like it is worth getting into anymore."

320,"Well CS Nexon. I have been so addicted back again with more medal@achievements, free reward after game and easily gets perm characters and gun. 

But i morely prefer the older CS Online back then. Why did CS Online close their server. Better do they merge with CS Nexon steam now and bring back all pro acc player who already in max lvl with perm guns and done medals before! 

Only CS Online gamers before knew their pain making medals,friends, and all ingame purchases gone and start playing again from zero in CS Nexon.

322,"please release new epic, so we can torture more zombies lol"
323,PAY TO FUCKIN WINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN :v
324,"Found it after few years closed server of CSO SG Server.

The game somehow turned out to be P2W now. I even spend a lot of money for decoders but all I got just low tier weapon that doesn't even fit for zombie scenario. Really bad RNG / Gacha system.

Playing it just to feel back the nostalgia that I'm used to play the old CSO everyday to have fun with (in game) family members. This game supposed to be addictive back then but now.. sigh.."

330,"This game it is used to be fun and addictive to play with your friends to grind up medals, completed missions, friendly- user, etc. But, now it is just pay to win game and give a lot impact to spend more money in terms of cosmetics skins that was part of the game so that players can get purchase from the micro-transactions in the game which is not wrong. However, the current situations makes the players less enjoyable to the game, with bunch of cosmetics skins that developer urge the players towards addictive on gambling which are awful and deceitful."

You can win mostly AI games without a good stuffs from pays and only need to pay when you reach a high difficulty of game. You can also enjoy various funny and excited games with your friends in here without paying anything. You can also play a classic game types (bomb, team deathmatch) without paying for any popular classic weapons. There is a lot of events that you may get most powerful weapons in the game, and you can make you're stronger by hard-working so don't say it's a pay-to-win game.

354,"[h1] Look... (the good) [/h1]
I tried this only to play CS 1.6 without paying. Honestly, I had fun, the PVE and Deathmatch gamemodes are fun. You do not require a 10K PC because it¬¥s just modded old school Counter-Strike.

[h1] BUT... (the bad) [/h1]
Of course has p2w stuff. To have the ""good or OP stuff"" without paying, it required LOTS of hours playing, events, ""grinding"", and being part of a big clan or group. [b] And also, it seems that if you dont play this game frequently (as i didn¬¥t), you lose ALL your stuff (starts from 0) [/b]
I didn't and don't know this very well or how frequent it happens, but seems that the game does some kind of purge (I tried playing again after 2 years, and this review is long after I tried that). 
I was upset only for that and now I don't want to touch this game again. [spoiler] Yes, I really wasted 669 hours and I'm not proud of it [/spoiler]

359,"Mileage auction prices is ridiculous. How can a +6 to +9 weapon have a higher price than a weapon that simply doing better especially in your average daily modes like Zombie Hero / Scenario ? Should we wait for the weapon to become popular again to get a rework or buff for those weapons ? No one wants to play Z Shelter anymore, can only find 2 room with 1 or 2 people in it. Normal match like TD, GD, Basic etc have the same fate too. Studio mode and Zombie Escape is dead. And the other modes ? Meh, no one touch it, it's like they are not even there.

But then again, without a better or strong community. All that problems won't get fixed because no one would care for that. And i hope that with those brand new decoder weapon that simply overkill everything, they would consider make a rework or buff for their old premium weapon like DK, Paladin, M Drill etc etc.

BUT HEY WHAT WOULD I EXPECT !? IT'S NEXON ALL OVER AGAIN BABY"

""Shrek is love"", I would say, ""Shrek is life"". My dad hears me and calls me a faggot. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Shrek. I called him a cunt. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it's really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. It's Shrek. I'm so happy. He whispers in my ear, ""This is my swamp"". He grabs me with his powerful ogre hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Shrek. He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Shrek. I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please Shrek. He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my butt with his love. My dad walks in. Shrek looks him straight in the eye, and says, ""It's all ogre now"". Shrek leaves through my window. Shrek is love. Shrek is life.Ôªø"

446,"-Not recommended due to lack of communication, fan support and balancing. Why? Cause the developers choose too, despite making money and releasing terrible content the community has problems with. 

-Released an Epic weapon that killed the game and it's playerbase. Making every exclusive weapons not bothered to be even use, pointless releasing them. The only playerbase you'll find are AFKs.

-Nexon not making independent events or a simple Email verification from new/old players to prevent smurfs.
Meaning it results them making and botting accounts.

-Tutorial for new players that doesn't even meet the current stupid state of the gamemode.
(Epic players, Rusty Wing spammers) If you're a new player that sees this, you'll already know this game just took a bad game design, and you won't find yourself be able to fit as a player. Nexon prefers you AFK and feed those payers. Yes, zombie auto-hunting mode.

-In-game report doesn't even work, why even make it a feature?
This will result to a large amount of cheaters, scripters that don't get banned, even if you do report them the way the developers want you too, but they won't take action because their so called Game Moderators doesn't banned them for paying the company Nexon and let them cheat freely.

-Before you expect, Map Abuse is a thing that can get you banned that doesn't even exploit the game's rules, even on a Zombie PvE gamemode. You'll even get banned without a warning. As such, why not only apply Map abuse for players that bypass the rules of the gamemode, especially in Zombie Scenario?

Epic weapons get aimbot in a FPS, a community forcing free/budget players to stop playing, a game not bothered to be advertised or supported because you get banned for showing in-game flaws/bugs to the devs and being called out an abuse and get banned. The only winners in this game are item scammers/bot accounts and the developers themselves. I do not ever recommend it. And Nexon themselves give Counter Strike a bad name.

Get killed by a Quantum Horizon aimbot 24/7 of the time, cheaters and alt account users populating to infest the game, no unique system to basically protect players from scripters even when you reported them.
Terrible game, don't ever bring the CS community to this garbage game, let alone call this garbage Counter Strike."

528,"A good game for y'all Counter Strike Online veterans that had your CSO account stripped away from you along with the closing of CSO's server in your country many years ago. Although many things have changed, the feel and the gameplay is still quite the same. CSN:S would probably guarantee you'll not losing your account by server closing ever again."

534,I played this game while it was still called nexon zombies and not nexon studio and i don't know what the difference is with this one but all i can see is wow hot russian lady who is probably starving for oxygen because she spent time dating some random hobo who sniffed fumes from the vladimir i. lenin nuclear power station near pripyat in ukraine. Would not recommend reenacting this random hobo's poor decisions. He would die from acute radiation syndrome 2 weeks later

548,"The main menu right when you boot the game is cluttered like a Chinese mobile game, so strike one.

I see a bunch of P2W crap and microtransactions, so strike two.

The game has no direction; the moment you start up a game, you'll have 300 ping killing a bunch of zombies that are just as cluttered as the main menu with a bunch of randoms to which you can't die because the games are modded into bloody oblivion, so strike three.

Not even an hour... not even a freakin' hour, and I can confidently say I've seen enough."

554,"it's nostalgic for me. used to play the game in my region version. but now all my fam members went separate ways and maybe they didn't know this exist. I wish they do but we don't get in touch anymore anyways.
it's similar to CS 1.6  but with more, and more game modes. there are some ""unbalanced"" weapons here and there. but they were meant to be used for Zombie scenario or other co op mission. But yea you can also disable or enable (as the host) special weapons for normal battle too. I mean i think it's necessary to use these weapons on zombie mode pvp too."

572,"el mejor juego que he jugado
"
573,Used to be quite fun and the coop/classic gamemodes are still somewhat enjoyable. Now it's pretty dead after they removed the only f2p elements the game had. Full of toxic kids with overpowered spammable bullshit mod weapons that you can only counter if you are willing to pay for the overpriced decoders where there's a slight chance you might get a weapon like that too. You'd be better off playing actual cs on modded servers.
574,"This game is like a drug... you know its a bad for you and a lot of things in the game are bad but you keep coming back because of the skins, op guns, and the shiny stuff.

Edit: After 60 hours of playing this game. i keep coming back"

582,"my time of playing this game says all
"
583,"In the very beginning of this game is a really nice game (I was playing in Singapore server which end service a long time ago). 
But now, it was just a P2W & Luck game that ruined your time and money.

Reason why you should stop playing it:
1) Limited edition P2W weapon that can conquer the whole game.
2) Useless Permanent weapon you draw from the box
3) Zombie being conquer by human which it should be the predator

You can just quit this P2W cs1.6 and play other good game :D"
584,sucks
585,I'm not allowed in the house anymore
586,"This game was insane back then when it was called ''Counter Strike Online'' (2008-2014) 
So many players all around the world united and had a great time and the game was requiring decent skill, unlike now game is completely dead, you might as well go f.uck*ng  deposit your whole monthly wage in order to buy your cool weapons.
the community vaporized over time  ,right now servers are  literally filled with bots etc... 
nevertheless i had inexpressible experience from this game probably something like this will never happen again.
 Thank you  everyone for the memories."

641,"Here you will see why I love Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio, but in my review you will read about why I gave it a negative review due to some problems.

I love Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio I consider it Counter-Strike 1.6 added for free for purchasing Counter-Strike 1.6 that Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio is a Counter-Strike video game with zombie mods officially built into Counter-Strike 1.6 supported by VALVe and Nexon Korea Corporation, but I do hate the microtransactions being sold.

Now since Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio uses OpenGL because VALVe removed DirectX 8 from the Gold Source video game enginesupport and now with VALVe pushing Linux support and removing DirectX 8 from the Gold Source engine video games adding OpenGL support to the Gold Source engine video games I keep getting OpenGL errors every now and then and some freezing issues, which I do not remember ever happening with DirectX 8.

Here is a screenshot of one of the few OpenGL errors I experience here and there. Followed by freezing of the video games that use OpenGL, before crashing.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/887417416764768257/926930307003850792/OpenGL_errors_on_video_games_that_use_OpenGL_on_Windows.png


VALVe and Nexon Studio Corporation please add DirectX 8 support or at least a more up to date version of DirectX 9 support which supports 64-bit, which is DirectX 9.0C I believe?

Otherwise I cannot give Counter-Strike: Nexon Studio a positive review due to these technical issues, which I cannot seem to fix even if I reinstall Windows or Counter-Strike: Nexon Studio.

I would say VALVe and Nexon Korea Corporation please release Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio  for sale on gog.com, but since Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio are both Free to Play (F2P) video games with microtransactions I do not want them sold on gog.com unless the microtransactions are removed. You have said with the Source 2 engine that video game developers developing video games on the Source 2 engine can release the video games that they develop for sale outside of Steam, without needing Steam as long as the video games are also released for sale on Steam."

670,"This is the only official and free old school counter-strike. An excellent way to return to youth. The game has a lot of gaming modes. My favorite is the classic one and the zombie scenario. I've happily played almost all the zombie scenarios and they are really nice to watch and participate in. Of the shortcomings of the game, in my opinion, it is necessary to name the fact that at some hours the game lags a little bit and that the premium weapon in the version with zombies is much better than the standard one. But, these shortcomings do not spoil my overall impression of the game!"

728,"My account was deleted rears ago due to an update that everyone needed to accept before some reset happened. in my case not playing for years i lost all my stuff becasue i wasnt there during the update.

736,ok
737,?
738,Great game!
739,"I play this game not because it's good, but because there are no similar games. Unfortunately, Nexon killed it with obvious overpower donation guns, stupid worthless your time events etc.

I love this game, but I must admit, I love Zombies from 2014 in my head. Only character skins are good."
740,why am I even playing this lmao
741,excellent game for marathon
742,the game is good and its the same game like counter strike online
743,bruh
744,old school cs game feels good man
745,"CS:Nexon zombies, is deffinately not a game for everyone, those who don't like the Source 1.6 engine then you are shit out of luck because the jank of that engine is also present here.
But the ammount of love and updates the devs give is just astounding, and the variety of game modes just keeps you coming back. Not every game mode is great and some are just annoying beyond believe.
Yet i have hundreds of hour into this little Mod compilation, creating your own maps, playing classic CS and offcourse my favorite mode the Shelter mode a fun little Tower defence game for up to 4 players, sadly that mode doesn't get as much love as the rest of the game modes.

Nexon corp. please give us more Shelter maps!!

Would i recommend this game? for my own viewpoint, yes!!! from the general viewpoint, Consider it."
746,"I‚Äôve been playing this game for many years, and it‚Äôs still a game you won‚Äôt get tired of.

758,"a heavily p2w based game, though the game does give you some weapons that is mid tier for free which is good. The overall game is fun but it can get tiring when someone has an overpowered p2w weapon"
759,This game is a joke...
760,"Great game, still play it after 5 yeasrs.

779,Alright!
780,Yes
781,When High elf natasha will resell again? I miss her event
782,"It's garbage. Fucking stupid beyond belief, meritless trash. Except... I love it. Sure, mechanically it blows. It's not good because of mechanics, story, or any particular player enviornment - It's the mood. It's the themes. It's like some kid playing with all his super cool flashy overdesigned  toys fighting his colored plastic zombie figures. It's garbage, but i highly reccomend it. It has highly positive recent reviews for a reason - It hasn't resolved it's issues, the community simply stopped taking itself seriously. Come and play if you think the idea of your knight girl with Eternal Laser Fists shooting beams at a xenomorph and then slashing up a bunch of zombies with her dual katanas, then swapping to her handcannon that when you shoot enemy the orb on the right fills with blood and then you can throw it so it explodes - The fun of this game is the absurdity, and playing with silly toys."
783,counter strike hentai offensive
784,I Was Old Player From Megaxus LoL
785,"this was the only game where it was only fun if it was pay to win and now you get every op weapen the second you log in and it's boring and dead now it was in it's peak in 2014 than after that it went downhill only way to resurrect this ""franchise"" is to make a new game with better graphics and bunch of new weapens at launch but don't get this game"
786,This game is very nice and bring back nostalgic

"
792,"This game was my childhood happy to see the dev still care about the game and it still has an active fan base, Zombie scernario was my fav mode. Beside the P2W the dev give a lot of events that you can grind to get some really good gear, lots of mode you can mess around in this game"
793,Yes.

810,Don't bother
811,"Used to be a good game it was some wild asian lookin cs 1.6 / source blend with anime tiddies, then they deleted most peoles accounts on bad short notice some of us didnt even know as we didnt look at the games steam community page or whatever ... shame coz was a good game but GG's now its dead with half of the community gone because aint no1 grinding for cyphers after losing all their avatars avatar items etc."
812,"even cs1,6 is better"
813,g
814,"Based on my 23 hours of game time I can say this is is a two - in one package. For example, your'e getting an older version of CS:GO for free, not to mention, CS nexus offers multiple versions of the game. CS Zombies(Play on iconic CS maps, with a multitude of other interesting weapons to be unlocked outside of the game), Prop hunt, sandbox games created by users, and much more. Overall, I can see myself spending at least 100 plus hours. Did I mention it was also free-to-play?"
815,everything is goood about it but sometimes its pay2win
816,"Even though I enjoy ""shit"" free games, this is just fucking terrible I have no clue how to even begin playing so I can't even give an opinion on the gameplay really. I played one match that was nearing the end and it was ok but I seriously can't even figure out anything with this fucking game and I feel it is not worth figuring out, I would just avoid it."
817,"I enjoyed it back in the 2016 days, but now things like Gun Deathmatch are just boring and the older weapons just get forgotten about."

858,"I played this game since it's title was Nexon Zombie, that time the game was P2W without a doubt and lots of reasons that you can see in other reviews why you should not play, then after it's title changed to Nexon Studio; the time with account wipe issue which it was a vary dick move from devs no doubt again, i gave another shot at the game

so far the gameplay is now great, although that active players are reduced to half and some modes are empty( not the good ones).

The P2W system now is more like advantage only: for example before, if you wanted to get a legendary gun like Paladin or python, dark knight... permanently you had to buy a decoder, which it was more expensive if you didn't want your chance be like a lottery some players described, now there are lot of events and missions to get weapons or decoders, there is a nooby friendly system that helps you know the game with awesome starter rewards. i played 10 hours before studio mode and bought 3 decoders which i lost them due to wipe issue, but i got all of them back in like no time (one perma Ak paladin and 2 perma characters)
and i have now like tons of good perma weapons and characters, however there are guns that you have to pay to get them.

The mileage auction system which is an event that you can trade your weapons for mileage or vise-versa
in it, Is a good time for grinding players to get almost any weapon they want ( with excludes that i think changes after each event i think)

overall for a Free-to-play game, Nexon has improved alot, but it's still not gonna be an awesome game in some players view. I recommend this game because it's fun , has a lot of content, got almost balanced, and going to be more sandbox type game like Garry's mode, but i don't recommend to support the devs by buying in-game items unless they guarantee they remain in your account, i mean wtf you pay for it to remain there."

917,My childhood never die
918,If you like those anime tittys then this is the game for you!
919,"For some reason, it only runs in 4:3 and most of the screen is cut off! Also, nobody ever plays the original modes, such as bomb defusal and hostage rescue. Never playing again!"
920,"This game is really nice, it gave me nostalgia moments when i was around 12 yo, however i'd recommend to become f2p player for this game because you may'll really waste your money just for weapons which actually can be borrowed by other players."
921,"Pros:
+nostalgic
+good mechanics (same as cs 1.6)
+many playable modes
+many weapons and characters, obtainable for free through some events

Cons:
-p2w
-NX and his friends are acting like a god who know everything about the game, give some stupid advices and answering a question with a question again.
-a neverending drama about the relationship between NX and his DdoS-ers friends.
-developers just focuse in zombie modes. 
-if you have good/rare weapon(s), you must prepare your mental when the weapon(s) is/are given for free in the future.

overall, you must try to play this game.. dont forget to play for fun, dont play something just for increasing the number of your enemies or people who hates you.. the game is amazing though"
922,"I do enjoy the zombie mode for nostalgia and don't spend a cent on this game (and if you do the events, you do get weapons which will give you the tools to survive with like 2-3 players with Epic weapons). I only played the Zombie hero, Zombie Z modes so that's what I'll talk about.

Overall, while I enjoy the short rounds and the zombie mode, the game is frustrating as a casual player who doesn't want to grind to get items from events and who doesn't want to spend any money at all. I would not recommend this to my friends, who are often casual gamers.

Things to keep:
- (zombie hero) random weapon mode
- decoder/item events kept a newbie like me motivated
- short rounds: I dislike the long 30+ min games from MOBA, auto-chess etc, and really like that I get to try something different every 3-4 minutes
- (zombie hero) weapon ban list e.g. banning certain weapons from a game (this is something I've seen done on the Korean server)

What doesn't work so well (IMO):
- (common to both modes) limited maps: like it's difficult to play a map that isn't Dust, Italy, Assault, Abyss 2. I really liked the Joseon maps and yet none of the rooms could reach 5+ people beyond the first day of the map releases.
- (zombie hero) a disproportionate amount of players have weapons that mess up the balance: in a room of 32 players, if like 3-4 players have massacre weapons I think that's ideal. Current state is that in a room of 32, there's about 10-12 players that have massacre weapons. For a casual gamer, it feels like an absolute waste of time when I become the initial zombie when 10-12 players have OP weapons and I can't even get to the humans...
- mismanagement of game updates/bugs: it seems like the update for CSNZ comes DIRECTLY from the KR server (which is ahead by at least a patch or two). e.g. the bugs that existed in KR server version x.y.z exists when the same version ships to CSNZ.

The game is basically CS 1.6 with custom unrealistic weapons & characters. The only thing that I've enjoyed so far is Zombie Scenario - which is PvE with storytelling through text boxes.

The only reason that I've played for this long is because of its exclusive events, which rewards you premium weapons that it's powerful, but nowhere near to the highest grade, which you still have to PAY to own it. It's surprising to see that this crap still have a community."

1066,"Game yang sangat bagus, sayang diserver indonesia harus tutup.. untung aja ada di steam saya sangat suka"
1067,"I don't know, I like it. I just wanted to click a simple ""thumbs up"", I like this game. Short, quick feedback to help with some broader metric of data, which required very little effort on my part to impact, mind you. But now... this input text box shows up with checkmarks and drop down menus. I understand you'd like for me to ellaborate, sure. You got the inch from me, why not try for the mile? But at least allow me to bypass this milking of a review from me. 

I just wanted to answer your simple question, ""would I recommend this game to other players?"" In truth, on two seperate occasions I have. There is your answer. As indicated by the illimination of the ""Thumbs-up-icon-that-says-yes"" button and the dimming of the ""Thumbs-down-icon-that-says-no"" button. Now please, add a change event trigger to your ""Post Review"" button. Make the review a voluntary action of the consumer and if they start typing in this field, you can trigger that button to say ""Post Review"" In the meantime, it should say something akin to ""Post Thumbs-up"" or ""Thanks for that"" or probably hundreds of better examples. This review is lengthy, but I really just want to drive the point here and I don't mind beating a dead horse. I would've happily gone through my library in the time it has taken me to write this review and given you accurate thumbs ups and thumbs downs on it's entire contents. Granted, it's not an extensive collection, but it was going to be good honest feedback that I'm sure would be useful. Instead, you got this only review that I've ever given to Steam and it was long-winded and mostly useless. What a shame. So much time, wasted.

Sorry to anyone who happens to read it, I don't expect them to actually keep a review that I seemingly try to stretch on and on at length, not mentioning the game or it's contents. If I'm to be fair, I guess I did mention I like this game. I do, and it was true when I mentioned recommending this game. So if this review is live, thanks for coming on this journey with me. All we learned is that I don't like being put on the spot to write reviews. Remember, I logged in to play this game. It's you (Steam) and your incessant ""Would you recommend this game to other players?"" in my face when I trying to relax and take an hour or two and enjoy my limited free time. 

And now for a story:
I walk home from work everyday and I always take this particular route. Why this particular route? Those reasons are my own. Anyway, when I'm walking home I always run into this homeless man. Let's call him ""Steam"". Everyday I walk home and everyday Steam asks ""Can you give me a dollar?"" and everyday I politely say no and walk by. This relationship goes on for years. I'm content, Steam seems content. It's a harmless question after all, and Steam doesn't mind if I ignore him, but he is persistent. Very persistent...which is fine, as long as things don't get aggressive or confrontational, I don't mind Steam asking me every time I walk by, ""Can you give me a dollar?"". Then I realized one day, as I walking by Old Steam. He turned to me like he always does, and asked me that tired repetitive question. I paused for the first time. He only wants a dollar. Surely I could spare a dollar! ""OK"" I exclaim. ""A dollar you ask and a dollar you shall receive!"" I dig my right hand way down into my pocket. Further down than what seems even possible! I yank my hand out produce a crumpled Washington and stretch my arm out to him, like an olive branch. He stares blankly at me. I'll never forget what that ol' codger said to me. ""It's all wrinkled"". I stare blankly back. The excitement has left me. ""I won't accept any dollar, I have conditions"". Do you know what I did? I spent the better part of my day yelling at that choosy beggar. ""Ha!"" I besmirched myself. I threw that wadded up dollar in his face and turned to proceed on my route. ""Keep the change ya filthy animal"", I say as to Steam as he fades away slowly behidn me. 

Did it change anything, not really. I still walk down that route that bumps me into Old Steam. Everyday its the same old question ""Would you recommend this game to other players"". I just know better now. And I think Steam knows too. If he only would take what he askedc, he might've gotten more. Whats the price of a friendly ""Yes, I would""?

 Never again Steam.  Never again.

The strongest guns are locked behind a tedious grind or a money pay wall (usually with irl cash or currency.) Way back before the game got the new UI changes and Sol Survivor gamemode story thing, this game was gold. However now its just another title slapped with F2P when every element screams, P2W."

1098,"Based on the reviews I've seen, it seems I have spent a higher than average time on this game, by far.
All I can say is that this game had huge potential on its early days. It had an impressive variety of gamemodes (scenario and hero being my favourites), with some p2w aspects,  but you could counter them somewhat with a couple of hours of grind.
It was a good game, ngl, but the p2w component grew exponentially with the years, with a constant decrease on the rewards obtainable via grinding, and a growth of the milestone requirements (something like playing for hours to achieve daily rewards for 27 days during a 30 day event). It was (or is) nuts, and led me to put in the game more time and money that I care to admit.
But the solution wasn't there either, you could complete an event like this, and spend your money on lootboxes until you got the very best equipment, only to have a relative advantage for a couple of months, until a new, better weapon came out. This resulted in the OG meta becoming completely worthless; not only because of the competitive disadvantage, but also because the developers countered this new weapon system by making zombies stronger, but only when an even better weapon came out, so you either had to buy the latest, most expesive lootbox, or be left behind with an ever increasing disadvantage. 
It hurts to see a game I played since almost the very beginning to become this shadow of what it once was, but today I must admit it's not worth playing anymore"

And maybe this game still can have a little enjoyment(i have no f*cking idea if it is fun or not). But now just don't f*cking play this. Yeah sure i might have a few hours in this game but its so bad right now. If you wan't to play CS Zombies go to 1.6 or Source or even CSGO and join a zombies mode or zombies escape server. Its way better than playing this sh*t.

1150,I just play it because waifus and i get bored so..........
1151,please fix the resolution issue its very annoying
1152,its p2w but atleast i can play
1153,"Oh I dont even know where to start or where to begin with the review, the game absolutely aged like a milk, and unfortunately, Ive only just found out about the milk that on my fridge and im embarrassed I forgot about its existence

Well, the trash has to be taken somewhere away, shall we? 

The pros:

+ Content:
Yes, as much as most of the content is locked (Mostly new weapons and characters, even skins these days...) behind a certain wall that you either throw your money at which is by the way probably not worth it or overpriced, or if you don't have money you have to dance like a monkey on a slippery ball and its your daily job, a constant cycle of repeating the shame crap over and over til you get your reward which is not worth it because its overshadowed by better guns

Pro tip: You can extract the game files using a certain program so you can look at them without needing to throw crap on amount of money, they can not stop you! 

+ Game Modes:
Im not gonna lie, the amount of game modes this game has is quite impressive, nonetheless, zombie scenario is still one of my favorite game modes that the game offered to this day, im not so sure about the ""build mode"" minecraft knockoff, yknow, could always hand out the SDK like a normal developer which has much, MUCH more mapping potential 

Oh well my optimism about the game disappeared so ill start with the cons now... 

- Heavy P2W:
Its funny how much Pay to win-ny this game got, heck, its so pity they're actually luring new players by giving them the taste of overpowered weapons only to realize that they last like 2 weeks, what? you wanted to keep that cool looking shotgun drill? DUH PAY MONEY TO GET IT NOW OR GRIND 600 HOURS TO HOPEFULLY GET IT FROM YOUR PESKY 70 DECODERS

- Balance:
Its a really popularly obvious for any horribly made MMO to have a two big red no no's everyone should avoid: Adding P2W automatically ruins the balance of the game, it doesn't exist, it existed at one point but it got ruined to oblivion with weapons that make you invisible (On TDM, and that's a pistol too...), ""Frick that particular zombie"" weapons where its absolutely screws the zombie and he can do nothing about it, and any kind of ""Premium Transcended Ultra"" weapons that for some reason also have to increase your exp and points rewards by 30%...

- Account Reset:
Did you know that at one point, the item servers were moving from one server to another and they gave you 2-4 weeks to just join the game and youll keep your items? Apparently they did that and I lost my 60 LVL account (Hey kids, the maximum level was 72 back in the days!, Thanatos 9, Dual infinity finals and Barlog 11 was the Hero meta...) and what if you lost one and want to get something back from your lost account? Nuh uh! No refunds sign is on your right sir 

-Bots, Real players grind and AFK???? 
I recently played the game like 2-3 months ago, its in absolute lowest point, nexon uses bots to make the game look ""alive"", most of the players you encounter dont even act like players and are very silent, and have a very detectable names if you pay close attention, most of alive players sit 24/7 on grind cube maps where they just afk and kill zombies and the zombies can do nothing about it, clans artificially increase their clan stats by using bots so they can farm faster and beat other clans that also use bots, and its just an endless cycle again 

Its just an endless cycles of people grinding for their sweet double golden uzis and theyre just stuck in there either paying money for it or wasting their time trying to get them

Its just an endless cycle...

Unnecessarily ban players due to informal in game name and could not provide enough evidence why we are banned. The GMs in this game could not even provide good customer support services, lack of knowledge how to guide players to resolve their account problems, this game does not even have proper or direct customer support services on steam, so that steam users can easily access to ask for support services.

Recently decided I'd like to try get back in to the game, and my god was that a terrible decision. It's just absolute garbage now. It's a laggy mess, despite having supposedly 80-100 ping. It's EXTREMELY pay to win wherein people who throw money at this game are rewarded with weapons that will literally one-two shot you when you're a zombie with 20,000 health, meanwhile people who don't are lucky to have a weapon that deals close to 1,000 a shot, let alone over it. The players are not at all hesitant to abuse exploits that allow them to clip through floors, either just their knife or their entire character, and while that's not the fault of Nexon, it still puts a damper on the experience when you're in the middle of a vent and get hit by a melee attack 
This game is not worthy of your time in any way, shape or form"

Game can be heavily exploited through various methods

---4/26/21 Update---
Turns out the game has an invasive DRM that kicks me every 15 minutes because I named a Notepad file 'Cheat Engine', and deleted my in-game account for made-up reasons. Made a new account, played two matches, and it bluescreened my computer. The file responsible was the game's anti-cheat.

Overall: This is just malware. **** Nexon."

1284,"Ugh,
This game is like if Condition Zero married a Multiplayer Minecraft server (Hypixel) and had a kid. Now the game is sorta fun, its free to play, and you dont need a supercomputer to run it, But they tried to put the Counter Strike series a bit toooooo far. No one wanted Hide and Seek, I mean its sorta fun but no one asked for it. They used GoldSrc (in fact it is one of the last games to use it) which is OK in my opinion. The character models look like they are from CSCZ but there is a feature (i think) where you can buy avatars and A BUNCH of times they are clearly R Rated for a game that a bunch of teenagers play. Its clear they promote this in one of the pictures they have a R Rated avatar on a character. Generally this game is OK at most, bad community, seems like it was made in a rush, and is just dumb in general. So only play this if you want to add a new Counter Strike to your selection or want to play a new dumb gamemode. If I were you, I would have this with my copies of CS:GO, CS:S, and the GoldSrc Counter Strikes but I would not play it that often."
1285,its good if your computers not good enough to play normal csgo

1306," competitive PvP and PvE action then this game is for you. The game offers you competitive PvP and PvE action including content from the original Counter-Strike maps, and guns. However the quality of the game is terrible, moreover, the graphics looks like a game from 2004 even tho this game was released in 2014. On top of that, the game looks like a copy of CSGO combined with a zombie mod üëé"
1307,"great game, but for some reason it lags a lot idk might be my internet connection."
1308,"Although it feels like Counter-Strike 1.6, it's Zombie mode feature does look like it have commendable hype for old school gamers. It's great to pick up the game for free and play like the old times."
1309,"It was free so why complain? Well going to anyway. I expected something like CZ classic maps or something CT's fighting zombies, or so the description seemed to indicate. The menus were very confusing and hard to navigate. It didn't take me long to realize there was no SP mode. I wanted to play with bots for awhile to get it down first. No SP mode so something one should know if you are sick and tired of griefers cheaters and arschlochs ruining the game. Once I figured it out I got into a game that seemed to be taking place in outer space or something with cartoonish looking anime characters. This did not even remotely resemble Counter Strike at all on any level. Joined another game and pretty much the same thing. Totally stupid fantasy gaming which I was never in to. Secondly I quickly noticed what others were talking about. Paying real money in order to win? Having to pay for certain weapons and so on? It's a stupid way to make money, live in game aggressive advertising, something I despise. And gawd the weapons were totally silly looking and also very cartoonish. I didn't really even play it and do not wish to. Instant uninstall of what appears to be a criminally stupid game"

Who ever playing this shit someday will write the same as we do. fix ur game too so much bugs"
1319,"I remember playing Counter Strike Online in 2011, I play this game from morning to night non stop it was the most fun I've ever had. The game is already so good even with the MG3 and Gathling Gun as the only good weapon you can get using real money or farming in Zombie Scenario and get a 1 day duration (MG3) but sadly the game is now filled with OP Weapon, I was going to put money in this game back in 2011 even though I'm not rich but now I don't anymore. They could have made some good skins and actually earn money that way but they didn't. The game was more popular back then than now. Now it just memory of old CSO or people forget about it. CSO 2 was my hope but they shut it down, sad.

For new player, if you can handle OP weapon that keep constantly killing you when you are zombie and you like grindy game then this game is for you, oh also it a bit Pay to Win. Otherwise, don't play it."

1333,"it's a bit quirky, but being free it can be quite enjoyable, haven't put to many hours into it yet and encountered a few bugs (of course) I'd recommend playing this if you're looking for a free game!"
1334,"This game is an abject mess, but serious Valve fans should play at least once. I hate to give something so clearly ambitious a thumbs down because thee are some great ideas and even technical accomplishments, it's just not very fun most of the time. To give some context, this is a [i]Valve Sanctioned[/i] Counter-Strike spinoff that came out in [i]2014[/i] but uses GoldSRC, the [i]Half-Life 1 engine from twenty years ago[/i] as it's base. The fact that [i]an actual Valve approved product[/i] had [i]any[/i] lineage with actual Half-Life assets during ""The Dark Ages"" when they wouldn't even mention Half-Life is honestly kind of monumental and the descent into madness just gets crazier as soon as you open the game.

Right off the bat, the main menu is one of the worst I've ever seen. There are 2 or 3 layers of thigns covering other things and dozens upon dozens of menus and submenus. There's so much stuff just scrunched together and so many notifications going off vying for your attention that the only way to even begin to parse any of it is just to go very slowly over each screen at a time. The only good thing about it is that it's skinned almost exactly like Steam UI circa 2008, so that was a fun blast from the past.

The first mode the game suggested is called ""Zombie Scenario"" and it plays less like Counter-strike and more like a very bad version of Serious Sam. A linear co-op campaign mode is a great concept for Counter-Strike, but every enemy is a bullet sponge and runs way faster than you can. If an enemy gets close to you it's almost always a one hit kill and the respawn times are around a minute and a half. I spent more time waiting to respawn than actually playing the game. It is impressive that they managed to have dozens of enemies chasing you at once on the [i]Half-Life 1 Engine[/i] and I generally like games where you have to backpedal while managing a crowd but killing an enemy is nigh-impossible unless you manage to stay with your squad and you're all focused on the same one. Enemies can knock you very far away so even trying to concertedly focus on one bad guy isn't viable most of the time. Headshots do significantly more damage and pulling one off does stall an enemy a bit, but not by mcuh. The level finished off with a boss fight in a cordoned-off arena and the Boss seemed to take damage much faster than the regular enemies in the level that preceded it. This was  fun at first but I quickly realized he had a massive area attack that basically one-shot kills everyone in the room. I imagine these balance issues are probably to try and get you to buy the good weapons, but making your game deliberatly un-fun is an awful way to get an audience hooked on what's supposed to be your main mode, and it's a shame because it did have some good ideas. 

The main PvP mode updates the classic Counter-Strike Zombies mod, where team of humans fights a team of zombies and if a zombie kills a human, that human becomes a zombie. Compared to the original characters now have various cooldown abilities to spice things up. Making this better than the other mode is the fact that dying as a human just puts you back in the game as a zombie, so you keep playing either way. If you die as a zombie, you're out for the round, but that's how Counter-Strike works so that's fine. There's a version with the added caveat that only headshots kill a zombie for good, which gets you a bit more playtime since zombies don't die as much, but tilts the balance towards zombies and the regular mode already favored them. One server randomized your gun each time you spawned and that was a fun way to see the wackier weapons on offer. The third variant sees both humans and zombies unlocking ""evolutions"" but no one was playing it when I tried, though I imagine it's fairly similar. These modes are fine [i]fine[/i] but feel too chaotic compared to the original version and even clones in other games like [i]Tower Unite[/i]. There's so much going on that you can't stop and think about anything and it becomes an unengaging spamfest. There's also a constant stream of the announcer screaming ""THE ZOMBIES WILL BE BACK, THE ZOMBIES HAVE RETURNED"" which combined with the rest of the game is a headache inducing sensory overload. The other gripe I have with not just this mode but other games like it is that there are just too many rounds per game and I think the whole thing lasts too long. That's more of a genre critique than a [i]this game[/i] critique.

Next up is Scenario TX and and it was actually promising. It's a top-down shooter, which is an impressive and creative use of the GoldSRC engine. The first time I played this mode, I couldn't pick up any of the weapons or get any ammo, which was miserable and left an awful first impression. I tried again on another server and once the game worked properly I had fun for a few minutes. Unlike the other co-op mode, enemies here actually die in a reasonable amount of hits. You gradually level up which opens up further weapons and you have some cooldown abilities like flamethrowers and melee attacks. The enemies are extremely simple-minded and mainly stand in one place aside from some robots that shoot at you, so the combat isn't the most engaging, but it is fun to mow down several at once. The problem though, is that this mode doesn't seem to have an ending. In both my botched first playthrough and my more enjoyable second run, once you clear every enemy you need to, the game just seems to reset and I really hoped for more of a payoff since the new round doesn't seem to change anything. This is still the most traditionally enjoyable of the modes, but it feels unfinished and empty.

Lastly there's ""Original"" and ""Hide and Seek"". ""Original"" seems to be classic CS 1.6 type gameplay, but nobody was playing for me to check it out. I can't imagine it's better than actual 1.6 and the real game is $5 anyway. ""Hide and Seek"" is probably your standard prop hunt and I can't imagine it being too bad unless they really messed it up, but no one was playing and that's a game mode available in lots of other places

What impressed me most about this game is the create mode. They've somehow recreated [i]Minecraft[/i] Creative mode... in the [i]Half-Life 1 Engine[/i] and you can use this to create your own maps. There's a good selection of prefabs to build voxel-style level geometry from and it's a great idea for an in-game map editor and the fact that you can share these in-game is brilliant. I think you can do this on a server as well with other people editing with you and honestly it feels like the closest thing to a GoldSRC spin on GMod I've ever seen. If they made [i]that[/i] the emphasis, this game would honestly be awesome, and I can imagine a late night collaboration session with friends would be a great time.

Aesthetically, the game is [i]interesting[/i]. There are art assets, character models, and weapons that are literally more than two decades old, but all of the new characters and weapons are higher fidelity. Having the blocky 2001 era SAS guy next to a super-intricate Final-Fantasy style Anime Magical Girl running through gritty real-world environments is [i]something[/i]. It's not too far off what you'd see on a Garry's mod server and I do enjoy seeing new art done in kind of a Playstation 2-era style where everything is just a diffuse texture with no normal maps or specular. I actually enjoyed how off-kilter this aspect of the game is, but it's definitely not what you'd call consistant art direction.

At the end of the day Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio, is a fascinating, but unbalanced and sloppy mess. While there is a lot of variety, everything this game does has been done better elsewhere and the few mods I did enjoy still had big enough issues that I didn't love them. It's impressive how much gas they've gotten out of the GoldSrc engine and the in-game level editor is brilliant, but it just doesn't lend itself to anything great."

Even better than some famous ones too and truthfully, I've never heard of this game until one day recently, my brother told me about it and I thought I could give it a shot and man, am I happy I gave this game a shot ! Although the game has its way of luring people to pay real money in-game to get great rewards, items, weapons and classes, yet I think some players decide to be free players and I know that those free players suffer too much because I used to be like them in the past until recently, I started becoming the other kind of players but in general, it's a great game indeed, totally recommended and I hope all people on Steam get the chance to try out this amazing game."

1351,"[h1]Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio (CSN:S), formerly known as Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies (CSN:Z) is an adaption of the original Counter-Strike. [/h1]

[i]About this game i reviewed:[/i]
Not only of Counter-Strike game, also this content less or more similar from Counter-Strike (CS:O).
Back then on late 2017, i first played CSN:Z for getting into Zombie Scenario Mode and blasting them with my teammates.
I'm not big fan of pay to win games, but there are paywall instead. 
There is player using overpowered weapons on lobby, making player left easier until patch removed it.

sadly its abit pay to win"
1391,"The Ultimate Boss level of micro-transactions. Be prepared to whip out your wallet mates its about to get costly. You wonna talk to your teamates?  Maybe do a little interaction? No problem buy a lobby pass. The game was fun when I played years ago. Idk what you call this its just lobbies filled with people spamming stupid strong guns nonstop. Infinite ammo, drones that one shot ect... Stay away from this heaping pile of crap."
1392,this zombie game is kick ass
1393,Best game i've ever play!

1396,"Very cool game with lots of features and neat accessories. Very similar to Counter-Strike: Online 1 and 2 or Perfect World CS:GO in the sense that absurd and funny non-conventional gamemodes are very popular (I'm not a defuse fan to be honest), and it is chock full of cool accessories, weapons, and skins that although they can be purchased with microtransactions, can also thankfully be earned by simply playing. I will continue to update this review as I play, as I've heard that the game used to be better and some users, who used to sing CSN's high praises are now complaining that their progress has been wiped or that the game has changed for the worse. If any such thing happened to me, I would be thoroughly disappointed. Understanding the frustration of former users, I will weigh the complaints made by formerly strong supporters of the game with my experience. I can understand their complaints, but I can't really know how great it was back in the day, so I can only judge the game as it progresses or regresses. So far it seems neat, but I have yet to play all the available gamemodes, so expect updates on this review."
1397,ok

1402,"The game of Counter-Strike is made into a party game where the rules are no longer taken into account. Custom games are the norm and they are comprised of toxic guns that take little skill, or take so much skill they cannot best the others. Make better use of your time if you are looking for a Counter-Strike old school clone. Play Valorant or CS:GO."
1403,"Like a wise man once said, this game is basically counter strike with anime girls.
No seriously, this game is legit really fun and i've played this since like what? 2018? 2019? i dont even remember but it was a long time ago. if you love zombies, anime girls and csgo download this! if you are tired of zombies you can always go on classic modes like deathmatch and such."
1404,"I played this game from 2014 to 2016 and now that I come back I see that there were many changes, even the accounts were deleted but it does not bother me because I can start from 0 and since I do not remember everything it will bring back memories of when I started <3"

1421,quite literally CS 1.6 on hardcore cocaine mixed with black tar heroin and cheap chinese cement
1422,"I don't know in what condition this game is right now. Last time i played this game was some years ago, but when i played it, i enjoyed it. I played it specially for the zombie game modes and for the football one. In those nearly 70 hours, i can't say i hated something, maybe the lack of players on some game modes. But overall, it was a good journey. 
(Again, i don't know how the game is right now, the review it is made for the time when i played this game, about 2-3 years ago).

From me, 8/10.
I hope this helped, thank you and take care.

1434,"I reinstalled the game just to find out that all my items and characters are gone.
This game was really fun to play 4 years ago, but nowadays it's just garbage.
It's really sad to see what poor management and crap ownership can do to a game."

1438,"The strangest game in the series, conceived by Valve & Nexon sometime in the late 2000's as a special version of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero (or maybe 1.6 but the models are very CZ styled) for Asian markets only to get clowned on by all of the CS clones that were already available in Asia.

Recommended for the die-hard CS fans ONLY as it's basically CS 1.6 with a f*ckton of mods applied and worse servers.

Also I just realised that CrossFire (aka the game that made Tencent into what it is today despite them not even developing it) has no Steam release... WHY!?"

1476,"Played this back in 2014 - 2016, prior to that, played CSO since 2009. I guess I have a lot to say about this game.

Man, where should I start... How to describe this literal ""junk"" right now? It's freaking unreal to watch a masterpiece slowly being ruined by mentally challenged game company staff and develop team. This game WAS FUN, no joke, back in day when people didn't F-ING fly around like they got rocket propeller sticking right up their arse.

Seriously, when I came to CSNZ from CSO in 2014, I saw the lost and forgotten spirit of team work, where everyone was equally clueless about the game but enjoying themselves at the same time. Then Nexon said: nope, this server is gonna follow what the other servers are doing.

Don't even bother get this game if you are from the North American region, your head will explode after seeing what the game mechanics have become."

Second of all the achievments are fucking impossible the third most unlocked achiev HAS 0.7% of people unlocking it, 350 hours on a zombie mode with family members? and another 350 hours on another game is complete bullshit despite the fact that this game is pay2win

1499,"en un principio era bueno, con el tiempo empezaron a haber nuevos errores los cuales no son solucionados, ademas de que algunos llevan a√±os. otra cosa es lo poco estable de los servidores, son malisimos a la hora de jugar. un problema muy notorio y molesto es la mala deteccion de mouse del juego, no detecta bien el movimiento y aveces parece que estas moviendo la camara con el dedo como si fuera un juego de telefono. el juego se volvio p2w al pasar de los a√±os, esto cag√≥ mucha de las cosas que lo volvian bueno, ahora solo es un counter gratuito con el cual solo es entretenido jugarlo con amigos o solo, ya que muchas veces jugarlo con otros jugadores aburre, todo el tiempo usando las mismas armas rotas las cuales hacen el juego demaciado facil y aburrido. algo que agradecer es unos pocos cambios en la mecanica de mejorar armas, pero ahora que no se pueden conseguir los paquetes de mejora de manera normal es algo totalmente inutil. un juego que va en picada y los creadores no piensan solucionarlo, no recomiendo jugarlo al no ser que lo juegues con amigos o arreglen todos los problemas que tiene actualmente."

If you want to spend some money in something worthless, I mean you can still try it without paying any cent
But i hate when someone has better things from me only because he is paying not because he is good.
This is my review to the game."
1530,nexon zombies was lit back in the day. i liek eggz
1531,good game but need to fix the server more better and should listen to their audience too
1532,cool
1533,"I used to play this game during my entire childhood in another country. There were no op weapons and the zombie mode was played as the way it was intended, which was very fun and pretty much my favorite game mode. Now however, because of how op so many guns are, the zombies are actually the hunted instead of the humans. This game is pretty much the world of the riches now.

With money, you can win pretty much most of the game modes easily.

Don't play any game modes designed for p2w players when you are a f2p. Like extreme difficulty Zombie Scenarios. You will not be having any fun. To have fun as a f2p, grind events so you can at least have a chance, and play game modes that does not heavily depend on how much money you have spent. If possible, play with friends.

This game will never be as good as it was in the past. I mean, what can they do? Take away all the p2w players' weapons?
It's a game you can play a little for fun, or simply have a good time with friends.

CONCLUSION:
Unless you do not mind to spend money on this game or willing to grind your butt off just for a little bit of power enough to self-defense in some of the game modes, I do not recommend this p2w game."

1536,I loved this game cause its sucks And Worse game ever Still enjoying it
1537,best 9ame iver

1540,"it wont open  the game it says  this game requries  steam
"
1541,Pretty good game.There's some good game modes not that bad events and [strike]good comunity[/strike]. If u're looking for game what u want to play cuz u're bored it's a good choice. Highly unrecomended to play more than 200 hours cuz game is really unbalanced at a bit p2w (to gain good weapons u have to spend a lot of time doing events but still u won't gain op weapon) Still u can play if ur firends are playing it
1542,"Actually, the game is fine, even great, but I have a problem with this game, I cannot play the game in full screen mode. Can you tell me the reason for this in the comments?"
1543,"It used to be better and unfortunately, this is true, from a good ""mod"" for 1.6 has turned into some kind of stupid anime.
There was an interesting system for creating weapons, which was replaced by decoders, similar to the cases."
1544,good
1545,game hay
1546,*sigh* this game is like if you  took a middle schooler who drew fantasy charecters and weapons that had spikes on everything and everyone has  duel katans showed them the later resident evil movies and said now make concept art using your art style and then also slipped that kid lsd in his kool aid and then took the bonkers stuff he made and put it in a game also that game was counter strike 1.6 also that game had microtransactions to you text chat in a lobby also that game had a top down mode also no one played anything but the zombies mode and everything makes no sense its audatori over load there is never not a second where something isent blaring into your ears its like a fever i dont know what to give this game so yeah just dont do drugs while playing this or do im not your dad

1625,"Back in the day, the game was genuinely good, now it's a complete pay to win plus the game isn't as popular now and the servers are garbage, but basically it's an old counter strike game that was zombie orientated but it does have different gamemodes to play and it was genuinely fun, you can make your own loadout and stuff like that but now, it's just borderline bad.

Nothing much I can say about the community.

There are a few bugs, but none game breaking.

The game runs fast and loads almost instantly.

Overall I don't recommend the game, even as something that's free, it's just plain bad now."

Not only does it not have advanced video settings like older versions of cs, but this fucking thing literally has fucking input delay FROM THE LIKES OF WITCH YOU HAVE NEVER EVEN EXPERIENCED. it is literally a cluster fuck of assets from any cs game that could have ever existed mashed into one shitty ass game for a franchise that really doesn't deserve an entry like this in it's history. i never realized how bad this thing was until just today. the release date is October 7th 2014, 20 fucking 14, for real? are you serious valve? this is terrible, honestly just rip this off of the store, this isn't worth the 5 gigs of space on your hard drive, it just isn't."

1678,Great game free cs game. similar to csgo
1679,"And to hell with graphics, people don't come here for it. There is such excellent dynamics that you forget about soapy textures and angular helmets right away. It was really interesting for me to play pve and kill raid bosses and go through scripted tasks. I am not in the least disappointed with pvp modes. And if you collect a small squad of commuted players, then the process of fighting carrion becomes even more entertaining. The game will not replace other mods about zombies, but it is guaranteed to bring pleasure.

I advise fans of team network shooters to try it, fans of zombie fashion also recommend paying attention. And don't look at the grafon for God's sake, it's not the main thing here."

1784,Good Game. Just Pay To Win :(
1785,0 fun playing as zombie vs HUMAN who have the most op trash p2w weapons i ever seen
1786,reality often disappointing
1787,"I play this game since obt at 2011 in indonesia version, don't mind the playhour here and sorry if my language is bad since it's not my main language to begin with, and also sloppy writing. (also i spent more than 1000$ back then, might be able to buy myself a motorbike). Skip to TL;DR if you dont want to see me ranting. 

It was a pretty fun game, especially back then when zombie 3 : the hero was the main selling point of this game. It was that time also when Hero is literally ""Hero"" of that mode until bullsh*t vvip weapon came out and somehow there's no counter to it (im looking at you Void Avenger). Now Hero has access to all weapon which is pretty good, but at the same time you need to stand still to buy stuff compare to when you only need to choose 1 out of 4 special weapon that the hero get using number at your keyboard without the worry of getting infected/die. It's not recommended to whale on this game just because every update they keep releasing more powercreep weapon. For example M4A1 darknights and AK47 Paladin which get powercreeped by every VIP weapon they release. Instead of simply buffing them, they make a half assed upgrade system which you need the same weapon in order to get them (Now they make it so you can use any permanent weapon (except the default one), but it depends on the rarity of the weapons, the higher the better (the fun part, their upgraded guns is not as strong as the recent VIP weapons). Feels sad for those people who spent lots of money to get those weapons from back then. Have i mention how do you get these weapons? It's from their gacha system called decoder. So no exact money spent at how you're going to get a single permanent vip weapon. This is why i decided to not support them anymore.

The only mode i enjoy now is the Zombie Z mode, just because people stuck with classic anti zombie gun early round. It became boring at higher rounds. Zombie scenario mode becoming much more p2w mode. They make the boss tankier and has more bullsh*t attack pattern (im one of those kids that somehow stuck with clearing ""last clue"" with mg3 and m249).

TL;DR If you're a rich masochistic kid and has nothing to spend your money on, this game is for you. The game keeps getting powercreep easily. It's not even enjoyable as F2P anymore"

1805,Just p2w and toxic player community as hell. Played this game for 2 years and it just gotten worse by time. Even giving free vvip pass to them who doesn't deserve it. Was a good game when there wasn't any epic weapon and now it's a nightmare for f2p community.

1822,"Not cool, no fair play and play to win ? of course!! ... I don't feel comfortable here anymore because so many fantasy weapon. bad game!!!"
1823,"I gonna say I m bias cuz this game back in Hong Kong was legit my childhood, used to finish school, head to internet bar and play cs online for hours. This is my monkey brain counter strike, I leggit just play for zombie scenarios. 

In this game u won't find skills, u will find over powered weapons and anime girls spinning ballerina with dual hand guns like in Equilibrium, and u probably have to sell your kidney to roll 500 boxes for that one gun u want for 10 days, but then again what second rated service provider online game originated from asia doesnt do that with their shitty micro transcation?

So ya final verdict, I like this game, its a good down time for me from sweaty csgo and hearing a 12 year old kid yelling cyka blyat, but you gonna be smart in here, read all the negative review of this game first and make your own judgement, try it out for free regardless, check the game out, they have pretty good starter pack for like 1 month or so, but dont pay a cent in this game unless u are sure this is your cup of tea.

1844,"When I installed CSN:S I was excited! But when I got to the menu I felt like it was a malware. Billion things popped up on my screen, I somehow managed to get rid of them. My first round ever, the map was dust and guess what ive saw. Anime girls Half Life 2 looking characters and barely any CS character. I was dislocated so i started following my teammates. They were mostly idiots. After playing with random people I wanted to make a server. I picked desert and I wanted to edit it, I dont know if im an idiot but I think you can only edit in game. In the end of the day I felt like i was playing a Half Life minimalist mod, THAT MOD IS BETTER THAN THIS! ANIME AND CROPPED OUT CS CHARACTERS DONT GO TOGETHER. To be honest I personally dont like the game, its weird and seems like they threw bunch of stuff like they didnt know what they were doing. I simply dont reccomend the game, if you like its, then cool! Do what you like. And my final ratings are 3/10"

1846,yes.

1848,"give us your money, give us your money, give us your money , basically sums up this whole game."
1849,"After I have been played this game for about 100 Hours now
I think it is the time that i have to put a mini review for it
*let's take us back for about 7 years ago, this game was launch in my country Thailand
under supervision by PlayFPSThailand, this game it's self was super fun to play it is Counter Strike 1.6 with plenty of Game modes and the most popular game mode was Zombie The Hero in that time.
The game was pretty fun and balanced 
-No Pay2win content.
-Don't have any Overpower weapon.
-Zombie mode is something about ""Work together and Survive together""
-The community was good, people just come here to having a great and fun time.
-You don't have to give a damn about those graphics you still get a good experience even it had a bad graphic.
I've spend plenty of my time playing this game almost everyday when I was the kids.
but sadly this game launch in my country for only 1 years and it's has to shutdown so I have to say goodbye for it
*Back to the present
I've seen the news that this game will unblock my country which means I can played it again
and I am so excited about it after I haven't play it for about 7 years long.
! BUT !
After I came back to play this game again I've started to notice that many things has been changed
-This game has turned into something close to ""Anime FPS Game"" (But that's OK i'm still fine with it)
-There is no more BALANCE in this game anymore.
-Piece of crap ""Microtransactions""
-The game is completely turned into Pay2Win Game.
-Many of overpowered weapons which can turn you into the dust in Zombie mode.
-The Community seems to be very toxic right now.
So after 100 hours spending with this game and you guys asked I'm recommend it or not?
My answer is ""NO""
But if you wants to find some nostalgia with this game I must say
""There is no nostalgia in this game anymore""
NEXON completely killed their own games because of greed."

1867,"This game is really ridiculous in a good way

lots of game mode, focusing on the zombie mode yet still have a normal human vs human and even original cs 1.6 experience [original mode] 

Yeah the weapon is what make this game ridiculous full of overpowered weapon yet still the zombie is always the one who win in the most round

Gaining weapon is easy if you have a good luck, there is many event that will give you bunch of decoder or even permanent weapon

Even though you don't have a powerful weapon when playing zombie mode, newer zombie mode is giving you many chance to use the powerful weapon you don't own [Zombie-Z with the karma points, ZB evolution with the evo point, or timed event random weapon map on ZB mode] so it kinda p2w but the f2p player is still can play and even beat the p2w player

The mileage auction is a great event too, you can sell or buy permanent weapon or upgrade parts when the auction is open

Imho i really love this game, i had so much fun playing this game

About the game, I love it because of it's zombie escape and zhero/zombie z mode. A good combination of classic 1.6 and zombie mods. Thanks for this game Valve and Nexon :)"

1877,"sold my kidney for this game, and it's worth it"
1878,Hah guys just calm. This game is so p2w that actually u just need to click left for 10 kills in a round. But be sure about u can grove yourself too but not like that easy. Just dont play this game because this game needs a stronger skill : Money
1879,"Actually this is a good game. Ofc it's p2w but atleast u still can get a lot of free weapon and class from event. if you don't like p2w stuff here, just play human pvp with classic or new classic weapon restriction, studio mode, or something like z file, manhunt, etc.For better experience just play with your friends.But too bad there's a lot of bugs here and poor community. And well yeah its a fun game for low spec pc.If you want to earn a lot of free stuff just do the event, level up,etc. That's all thanks :)

Anything else aside zombie mode are good, but this game focused on zombie mode :v . pls devs you need to make zombie that can withstand that, a zombie that can be only used when there's op weapon user."
1891,not worth your time
1892,Nope the game is litteraly a pay 2 win and there is no point playing it the zombie matches and moe are costanly full of tryhards with bhoping to max edge of map and theres no point on playing even on crafting that it has a really bs crafting system so just no

[b] An Absolutely Terrible Video Game That Will Have You Praying Your Antivirus Is Effective [/b]

I cannot really describe in any effective way how terrible this game is. Yes, it is made for an Asian market, but it is littered with microtransactions, ugly UI, layers of menus, and has horrific gameplay. This is genuinely a piece of garbage that should be removed from Steam. I believe I lost a chunk of my brain from the mix of awful gameplay and extremely high volume.

Don't even bother downloading. Obviously a [b] Not Recommend [/b].

1915,
1916,"Valve gave some random idiots in a korean sweatshop a license to make a CS game and they made a terrible P2W shitshow with items that cost hundreds of dollars for no fucking reason that get deleted from your account in about 30 days. They don't use the steam inventory so that they can make majority of the guns you can get have a timer on them that deletes it out of your inventory because they want you to constantly pay just to play the game. You don't have to pay for items or anything like that but even if the P2W elements were removed it's still garbage because they capped your Fov at 75 and removed the command to change it along with a lot of other useful commands. Also it just won't fucking launch sometimes, I have no idea why  or what causes it I just know that the weird spaghetti code that they made this with causes it to never fully open on occasion and I've had to reinstall it multiple times to get it to work."

zombie mode is 10/10 but the anime guns it's 2/10
really wish i could play this before in 2014 but yeah that will never happend cuz its 2020 now.

1964,Yes
1965,"Good game with ways to get good weapons.

But sometimes their ban system is questionable.
For someone who plays on a public PC (Internet Cafe) to play this game, without realizing illegal macro programs are on by default, and they already got a ban, and it's too late. Really...? 

This case happened to me as someone installed it on this particular computer, and i was playing it while it was on, unknown to me (it means it was on, but i don't have idea it was installed.). And yet, here we are.

The verdict is already 100% guilty regardless my defense appeal that the macro was installed while i m clueless it was in this particular computer i got banned.

So... a good game but banning system is a fluke sometimes. How can Nexon expect us to check every PC we use to play is free of macro?"

1979,"nice XD
"
1980,What is this game and why do i have 14 hours?
1981,"The game which used to be a masterpiece in 2014, totally surrended to a p2w system which turned into fkn blsht. Old players like me, learned in the beggining that the key to survival was cooperation, otherwise you would die easily. No longer, as for now, a single player, with a  pistol can kill an entire zombie team, alone, under the condition of buying this latest equipment that will make the zombie paralyzed while it will aim for you, guaranting a confirmed shot even behind you back, easy to kill, without no further masterskill, like a legal hack. The game is free, yes, most events can give you some equipment able to defend yourself, that is, if you play for more than 4years, you will earn it. The easy way is tossing 1k in the game in a roulette system (yes, you need to be lucky) so that you will grab a master gun for your self. Its sad that a game with multiple game modes that used to have thousand of players, now have a few dozens. The game is dead, nexom should learn that its greed will make this game fall in no time."
1982,Good
1983,IDK its fun
1984,"Very fun, i like it, recommend!"
1985,it's fine i guess
1986,;
1987,better than cs:go
1988,not bad game just too pay to win unfortuanetly
1989,"Just a worse version of Counter Strike. Maybe you'd like it if you liked the weird game modes for the original Counter Strike, I didn't. And I don't mean the popular ones like the random upgradable guns, or the shitty ones like surfing, I mean the inexcusably dogshit zombie asymmetrical ones."

The answer is no.
Don't like it?    suck it.
Also the devs gonna make bots fight for you when you afk now.
suck on that,b1tch"
1998,"The game used to be good, I played it somewhere in summer to fall (or autumn) in 2015, little bit in 2016 because I couldnt get into my steam because email problem. And I revisited it in 2019 just to see how it changed. This game went from pretty good to s**t imo.

1. Its pay2win I mean it always was (no suprise, its modern game and its free so they need to make some money somehow).

2. Weapons are unbalanced for example (if I remember correctly): Thanatos 9, chainsaw and maybe other weapons...I dont remember.

3. (somewhere in late 2015 maybe early 2016) Mileage decoders were f****d in one update so it made them more difficult to get them. Before some update there was pretty good way to get them, by taging missions as favorite (which changed one reward into mileage decorder) and once completed you could choose one of the reward and one of them was of course mileage decorder. After the one update *poof* its gone  no more easy mileage decorder you peasant either get points by playing the game (which could take some time) or...you know buy them with real money because xD why not ?

4. My account was deleted sometime ago even tho I had some weapons, cosmetic items and other stuff because again xD why not + the free dlc I had installed didnt work in 2019 because they removed it I dont know why but ok.

Overall I dont recommend this game because its just f****n meh I dont really like it anymore and yes its a late review."
1999,its okay game but i would just play BF3-4 or COD or mmo rpgs ... mmmhmmhh

2004,"The ""Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies"" is a better name than the ""Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio"".

Why did they changed name?"
2005,pay2win but is nice
2006,It's a fun game for everyone!
2007,"Aside from the odd crappy map or two, it's good :P"
2008,"the greatest money making scheme i have ever seen
if pay to win was a game then it would be this
if you are not willing to or just cant throw away 200 dollars or more then avoid this game it will be unplayable ""pay to win weapons and such""
i wish i could go back in time and stop myself from wasting so much damn time on this game ""around 1000 hours or more on a different account""

i dont even know why this is on the store being advertised as a counter strike game
assets are so random you have realistic cs terrorists and counter terrorists next to anime girls
there are so many gamemodes from zombie mode to prop hunt
they are all dead and the only active modes are zombie hero and maybe team deathmatch
most of these ""gamemodes"" are not even related to counter strike and are typically ripped from other games for example you have zombies and soccer along with a dead by daylight clone

this is less of a game and more of a garrys mod anime girl server with nothing that would even accidentally make it fun or fair to play with the pay to win players and their weapons being able to blow up the entire map and make them invincible with a single click of the mouse

this games ""anticheat"" is easily one of the worst i have ever seen you just get randomly kicked from the game with a popup saying something like ""detected by blackcipher"" if i remember correctly and this typically only happened when i had google chrome or discord open meaning you could just get kicked off of the game for daring to listen to music
its actually quite rare making it even more confusing when you do get kicked off
its as if the anticheat just randomly malfunctions and kicks you sometimes its really weird

looking around in the discussions i only saw a few posts but they appear to silence anyone with a negative opinion on the game and i doubt the developers even read reviews so its not likely they will ever hear criticism but i can give you the best advice you will ever get here
this game is a waste of time and you are better off spending $10 on a real counter strike game or just downloading counter strike global offensive which is still not great in my opinion but its 1000% better than this anime girl game trying to pose as counter strike"

second : weapon more powerful and insane, so there's no more balance gameplay (for PVP zombie mode)

By the name, I'm guessing it was the game called Counter-Strike: Nexon Zombies, or something like that, I used to play that a bit. But, this just doesn't seem like it at all, very p2w now. I can't even say this seems like CS 1.6 anymore. The game was great and fun before all the changes."
2035,It's pretty gud.

2055,"This game is highly pay to win and i don't see my self playing most of the mulity player games with other people who have put in money into the game but zombie shelter with a couple of freinds is always quite fun as in that game mode you have t survive for two hours and protect you shelter as waves of zombies hit you home it is quite fun and with a couple of other people it is a good game with exeptional graphics. However i cannot recomend the game becasue of how pay to win the rest of the multiplayer is. If this game was payed i would not even praise it ,like i did earlier, but because its free it can be fun just to hop on the game with a couple of friends and mess around for a bit."
2056,"You have to pay to become a woman, too realistic... 1/10

2057,"I just want a shi tty magnum launcher. I paid a lot but still did not get it. Money-trapping game. 
New update: I spent some more, and still can't get it. I hope nexon see this review. I hope you nexon will go bankrupt soon. Take it easy nexon, you are paying me back or bankrupt asap. In CF you pay 150‚Ç¨ and you will for sure get stronger, permanent top weapons. What about csns/csol?  As a comment said, it's gambling too hard. This magnum launcher's rate is for sure cheated. 0.15% for TD and 1% for TPD? same as Holy sword? then why i got holy sword 3 times without a magnum launcher? You cheated many people and continue to cheat overseas players. Don't you feel ashamed nexon? This game has less and less players as a consequence. I will continue to play, but I wish you nexon go bankrupt ASSSAP."
2058,good
2059,"I bought this originally because CSGO wasn't free at time, but this is a far cry from Its tactical and strategy bass gameplay and now replaced with rrepetitive zombie killing and an unoriginal building mechanics, just get Left 4 Dead 2, Gmod and the aforementioned instead of this"
2060,"I was play this game at 2011, CSO but in Indonesia Server, a lot of fun , also a lot lose money, because i spend for this stoopid items are nice, fak idont believe it i play this game at 2020. i miss my friends at 2011, who not play this game anymore, today i just play alone, im very sad. ive good memories to this game."
2061,"Since CS:GO went Free to Play, there is no need for this game.

There is a lot of Pay to Win in this game as well,
dont waste your hard drive space on this trash."

2069,"Its a shit game filled with ptw. Want to win? Why buy a crate that contains op items that render you un-touchable! Want a sword that literally make you immune to any damage? BUY A CRATE! Want a literal infinite gauntlet weapon that down around a 1000 damage but fires like 50 rounds per second, and never runs out of ammo? Buy a crate...

And to top it off, if you dare to kill the host of a game, prepare to be insulted and kicked. Because everyone here is either European or Asian and has hair thin skin... dont play it, for your own sake..."
2070,good game
2071,E
2072,"This is honestly really sad. Before this monstrosity of a game. This used to be known as Counter Strike: Nexon Zombies. It was an amazing game that obviously consisted of surviving the onslaught of the undead in lots of different and fun mini games while still exploring the classic fun that was Counter Strike 1.6. 

After one night filled with nostalgia, I come back to this. The game has become this mix between minecraft and what was once the glory days of CS:NZ. Not to mention that the whole game in general has become a pay to win scheme. The developers I'm disappointed me and I'm sure a lot of other people with the unnecessary changes made to a game that was doing good on it's own. 

I do not recommend anyone to play this garbage pile of a game and please move on."
2073,nostalgia cso :D
2074,"well i really did enjoy the game lots of fun and i even spent cash on a few things but yeah i took a nice long brake as every one one does in the end Due to work, new games or other reasons. there is no excuse for the data loss due to a silly migration you are transffuring the data of tons of players so why not the few extra in case the return in the end they payed cash for content ... so why the hell not move all data in the end most these players have played and supported your game and then u take a huge steaming turd on them by saying ohh sorry you had to agree to the migration or we remove your data, and then there is nothing we can do if you didn't the data is gone.... i feel that all the players who couldn't agree to the migration and lost all there hard work and everything even the cash they spent should get compensation and a refund in at least some of our stuff ... and to top it all off it dosn't make sense who they say u loose all ya data but it was actually just player data ... why did it keep my clan some stuff in it like achivments and stuff was wiped but why does it have the EXP then and why is it still there .... also one of my load outs were still saved with the weapon in it was a perma but it said expired and for some reason it still allows me to spawn with my skull sniper in Z senaro ...  i also have the starter pack still but non of its content as its all been removed and cannot be reclaimed.
With how some of my game data is still there and the rest not i think tbh that its not that they cant do it and more of the fact they just don't want to Sort players data ...
Unless they can sort this stupid issuse and refund what they lost i can NEVER give this game a good review."
2075,pretty good game. You dont need a pretty op pc but not a potato one. Just a basic one can make it work perfectely :P

Pros:
- Good amount of game modes (TDM, Zombie Hero, Zombie Scenario, etc...)
- Models
- Family system (something like a clan)
- Weapon/Character collectibles
- A lot of oldschool maps

Cons:
- Pay2Win system
- Hitboxes
- People are sometimes toxic xd"

2123,its fun
2124,"i really only have played this for a couple of rounds on the original cs1.6 gamemode to get something similar to counter strike neo, which is just old cs with hot girls.

it's free to play, there seems to always be an active server (ping might suck but it hasn't bothered me), you get mileage points all the time that you can use to pick your waifu for the day, or you can unlock a permanent one from a loot box.

there's all sorts of other things beyond that and i don't care about those, i don't play the zombies modes or anything like that, it's almost a mod for cs1.6, and it's great."
2125,For the Nostelga
2126,"It's free original Counter-Strike with added zombie flair and other game modes not in the original. All of this with continuous updates and seasonal events to keep the game fresh. What's not to love?

They've added a female voice to the radio chatter (as well as female player-characters) that has grown on me so much I miss it when playing CS:GO.

No pay to win, and though the loot boxes are somewhat outrageous in price, they are optional as most everything can be steadily earned by simply playing the game. 

This game is basically had Valve continued to work/expand on the original CS, and I find myself gravitating to it over the newer games in the series."
2127,I got the game for no reason and launched it and now it forever says I am playing it while I am not and the stop button broke for it. I haven't  signed it yet and I have 4 hours.  I am forever cursed by Counter Strike Zombies.
2128,"While it's not the most advanced game in terms of gun play or graphics, in terms of content the game has plenty to offer. It is a very enjoyable game to play with friends when you just want to mess around and not worry about anything stressful such as real life events or events in other games. The zombie modes are definitely the best modes in my opinion, and everyone can enjoy themselves on them."
2129,"Why i can  open the game
they say this game require steam and I open steam in is cannot run someone would can help me please"
2130,I spent a summer loving this game. I came back to see if memories of that summer will come to me and inspire something new for me to look back at and something to consider future endeavors for. I wish I left my thoughts alone instead of chasing dreams through nostalgia goggles. I guess I'll call it a phase.

2160,nice game
2161,"As usual, Nexon validates my decision not to ever pay them a plugged nickel. I was a day one player and had fun in spite of it being a normally cheerless grind against the P2W because of the inventiveness of the modes, relative wealth of content, the crazy community, and the basic utility of the good old Half-Life engine. What they did with the account reset - giving people a mere month to basically choose to save their account and all items because they didn't have a big enough tape drive to migrate all the data - should not be legal anywhere. As an extra nice touch they've also reset my achiements when they could have left them alone.

The grind was obnoxious enough the first time. My extreme nostalgia for HL and CS MMO-ish stuff isn't strong enough to overcome my disgust at this failing company which borrows community assets (some sound effects were taken from well-known HL mods!) and then betrays our trust repeatedly."

I look at CS Nexon in steam. I have spent almost 100$ for this game and didnt get a good weapon which i want. Nowaday, 'the new CSO' is too Pay 2 Win. Believe me, this game is so much cancer who think he is pro just because of his weapon. Ego is bigger than teamwork, teamwork is beaten by money. Power of Wallet!

Nexon Studio is a rename of Nexon Zombies, a localization of Counter Strike Online which was a Asia-exclusive Online CS game, and by Localization, I mean literally porting the Systems and P2W aspects. The game is just Counter Strike CZ but with CSGO's Montization x50. Here's a review. By the way, this is not hate ; This is my honest thoughts about this.

Gameplay :
It's oldschool Counterstrike. Except crap. The game has so much P2W aspects to it. Of course you got default weapons and some skins you can buy which are more expensive then CSGO's and are NOT permanent and timed for a month or less, but the game is full of Season Passes and exclusive weapons which are Overpowered as hell and give you an advantage over the normal players because you paid $$$$ for the best weapons which can wipe teams in seconds. There is some interesting stuff though, like Zombies which Coop is a nice addon but it is still ruined by players literally stealing kills and cornering bosses with OP weapons and running faster then the flash on crack, giving you no point in doing anything. And all those characters you see on the screenshots and neat guns? Those are with Season Passes. - 4/10, just because it's Counterstrike.

Visuals : For Goldsource, it's still Goldsource. It's nostalgic, and it looks neat. The art is very misleading though, like when you unlock a Timed character, you expect characters to look like the art where they look sick as hell, then look like PS1 Hagrid in comparison. Although it's just Goldsource, and they tried pretty well to keep the engine up to standards. - 5/10, just because the game looks decent. 

Story : There is no freaking story. It's CS. I think Zombies has a story but I forgot, it's thrown in the background. - 2/10.

Verdict : Don't download this. It's just wanting your wallet. Of course it has all this cool stuff, but the game is filled with filler and Microtransactions. It's litterally a Chinese mobile game, except higher quality and tries, but the game feels lifeless and it is just a cheap localized FPS that gets money I had a horrible experience playing this back in the day because I was poor. Go play CS:GO instead, or hell CS:S or the actual CZ. You will have a lot more fun there and you won't have your cash poured down the drain. Of course with CSGO, but that stuff is not needed to play the game. - 3/10."
2208,good
2209,good game
2210,It's a good game.
2211,no
2212,What the fuck is this game
2213,really cool game
2214,"The quality of this game had been deteriorating for years until it reached this point where it's no longer playable and the GMs seem to have a monopoly over who gets to play anymore.
I've seen some fair players get banned while most of the abusers/exploiters happen to be in the GMs family.
Never seen a game that's full of so much unmotivated hate."
2215,"Unless you are an extreme try hard with lots of money to burn, good wifi or ethernet, or a good gaming rig, don't waste your time, it would be better spent on games like TF2 and other games out there. Not to mention this community has gone downhill big time since the closure of Nexons European office. A good chunk of what the community suggests, either is ignored or filtered CCP style to an entirely different version, whatever suggestions ARE heard and implemented, they are FAR and FEW.


The hours I spent on this, was hoping things would really turn around since Transcendent weapons were added, but I was wrong, then came epic weapons, the toxicity from the p2w's then began to truely shine/show, only thing that was worth coming back to was some season pass stuff, but lately, unless Csnz pulls a real miracle, no amount of f2p events can hope to save it, knowing the p2w system WILL drive away newcomers who can't afford it. 

Long story story: save yourself your time, sanity, and potential ingame harrassment from some of the nastier players and don't play this or uninstall via CCleaner"
2216,well i enjoy playing this on my free time
2217,"it was funny game XD
"
2218,"Connection to server has been terminated is the problem but over all the games fun 
but too many pay 2 win"
2219,"Few years ago this game was awesome. You had to grind to get powerful guns and items, playing with or against zombies was fun and balanced, but now you can get even better guns literally for free. With new overpowered guns zombies (not talking about scenarios) can't even come close killing or infecting you unless you are blind. So I see no point of playing this game anymore. Thanks for ruining this game."
2220,Its very awesome i recomand it but not for little kids
2221,bad game i almost burst my ear drums by playing this for 2 seconds
2222,"Pay2Win, because it's a free game.
Online, because it's a paid server.
Playing this, because of nostalgia ;)

Thank you Counter Strike Nexon for bringing a lot of happy childhood memories ever since the first release."
2223,"pretty good
"
2224,if csgo turned into fortnite with pay to win weapons
2225,"I just can't take this game as a serious CS Franchise game, sorry =["
2226,"A Chinese Counter Strike rip off (kinda ). It was once fun but now, now it is just a piece of shit that is extremely pay to win

The best parts of the game are the menus and the loading screens, because you don't have to play the game."
2227,"from cso, cs 1.6 into nexon and now studio :)"
2228,"Honestly, this game is fun and easy to play. There are stuffs that require you to buy in real money but they also give away a lot of good ones, e.g. guns, characters,... and it can be permanent if you're lucky.

The launcher's UI is not very much user-friendly but spending a couple few minutes, I can get familiar with it. 

Dunno why there are lots of hates for this game but for a shooter-head like me, it's way much better than Crossfire or even Warface!"
2229,this game is very fun to play but its depend on decoder to get variety of weapon its very-very painful.
2230,"not my thing at all
atleast they gave away some of those decoder things"
2231,"p2p

"
2232,good game
2233,"like one of the best game i played from my childhood but the game changed a lot 
+still the good zombie scenario
+they added mileage auction and i love that cuz now i can have all the weapons i dreamed about
+still working on the game
-the game is now more like a sand box game by the studio
-the game changed into some wierd language like insted of round win it says raunt mamald 
-the new HUD is ugly the old one was best
-+menu soundrtacks are good but the first one was my favourite
8/10 :)"

-Its alright, if you wanna shoot some zombies for a couple of hours.

-Kinda pay to win, but they do give you lots of free stuff so........

-PVP is kinda fun but the shooting is weird.

-People drop you the OP weapons so you don't have to buy them.

-Lots of mini games!

2255,"Last Time i played this games was in 2015 and 6 years later i reinstall it to play it for fun

1: what the hell happened in 6 years?

2: you cannot craft permanent weapons anymore (i guess screw me for saving so much crafting material)

3: crafting is now relegated to giving weapons powerful buffs and nothing else

4: the main menu was very confusing because the amount of pop ups and clutter

5: my character and inventory got wiped thanks for removing my old battle glock, battle famas and battle galil

6: i try to play the game only to get resolution issues and it made no sense why i was having a problem like that

as a different recent review i saw said this is not the same game anymore and i can clearly see that"
2256,"not my fav but, i guess is oke"
2257,It is kinda a good game with a lot of very fun weapons to use. But all of the best weapons are lock behind a paywall you have to pay a lot in this game if you want to have the best experiment. It is a P2W game.

2290,"EDIT: Apparently this game can corrupt your windows to a degree, do not install.

Decided to change this review once again, as i've played the game for few hours more and my experiences have given me knowledge.
Knowledge on why this game ended the way it did.

Firstly, let's start with it's release.
Nexon Zombies was supposed to be CSO fit for other markets than Asia.
How did that go? in my opinion, very well.
The game was popular and was basically renewed 1.6/Condition Zero and the most important thing: it was free.
Sadly that didn't last long, as new weapons were being introduced and well, you know the rest.
The game by 2016, was already being disliked and as time went on, it only got worse.
Around 2017/2018 there was some drama about Keylogger being used as anti-cheat software, aswell as game having in-code spyware.

I have absolutely zero idea if that really happened and existed within game files but the lone fact that players mentioned something as such really brings up some concerns; safety and trust concerns.

(The game still exists on steam so i guess it was one-time thing, or at least i hope so.)

Now, for some modernity: 

Between 2017 and 2018, as far as i remember, the game got reset.
The name was changed from ""Nexon Zombies"" to ""Nexon: Studio"" and new terms were added.
Pretty simple right? doesn't seem like bad thing until we realize the main issue with this:

A) Players we're given 1 Month to agree to new terms, otherwise their account got deleted/erased.

- In my opinion, this was one of main factors that have driven community away from the game.
People spent money on it and lost everything in a flick of a finger.

- Developers are not at fault but they should've ordered staff members to send messages (even automated) to each and every person on Steam that had big numbers (hours) in the game, as kind of reminder for the thing but there's no need for crying over the spilled milk right?

Well, like i've mentioned previously, it was one of main factors that pretty much worked like cold water on a cat for players.

Now, time for another topic.


~ The Optimalization ~

The game runs on engine that's 15+ years old and that could be ran on toaster.
While i personally find it charming and nostalgic, as it gives vibe similiar to those old days of 2010s when you would just start 1.6 at night and play ZM Servers with friends, the optimalization for this game is nearly non-existent.

What do i mean by that? The game is SUPER heavy for CPU.
GPU doesn't play factor in that due to the fact that this is pretty much potato-graphics rated.

The game is processing multiple things at once, so many things that it can even freeze for weaker CPUs.
You have the option that enables less detailed models and stuff in ""Options"" but even then, the game is heavy.
Stuff like particles/effects from weapons can lag the game, the ability of certain zombies aswell.

Apparently, there was another render for game but alas it was removed.
I have no idea why, honestly.
We're now stuck with one that runs far worse than the previous one and i'm afraid to even say it's name or i might freeze just like my game.

Jokes aside, this is another reason why majority of players we're driven away from the title.
The game got so heavy that they would either upgrade their PC or suffer tremendous lag.

I still wish that Nexon would really dedicate themselves to fix this issue.
It would surely reward them in player-count or at least, make current players dedicate themselves to the game, as it would be shown that developer really cares.

End of the topic.
Now for another one:

~ The Issue with outdated medals, weapons and whatnot ~

If you're still playing this game to this day, like i do, you will notice that over years the game did not get any rerun of certain events.
Even worse, majority of medals (basically titles for your nick) has became UNOBTAINABLE!

It's no issue right?
It's just some text in game that's about killing zombies or whatever.

Well, it is an issue.
It shows that the game wasn't really cleared from previous events that might never come back again and then, THIS shows that developer doesn't really care.
It also creates confusion in playerbase, as they (players) want to get certain medal and they can't as it cannot be obtained.
Creating false hope for a rerun of event basically.

- Now onto weapons, many weapons are powercrept.
This means that certain weapons in current rarity grade are better than others,

Example? AWP Elven Ranger and AWP White-Tiger

Both are Transcendence grade, both are sniper rifles.
Well, what's the issue then?
The certain mechanics.

White-Tiger has a ""net"" move that captures a zombie and makes it immobile for a short while, has secondary mode that basically makes Big Tiger summon attack the zombies, dealing massive damage.
(Hence the name, White-Tiger)

Elven Ranger is a Railgun-ability based Sniper Rifle.
It charges up the more you stay in the scope mode.
From 10% to 50% more damage.

Now, you see that those are both S-Rifles with different abilities and stats.
The thing is: one deals around 10-15k damage per ONE SHOT and other one 4-7k dmg, putting aside that the first one also has secondary AND ALSO has that ""net"".

I get the fact that they're different weapons with different uses, stats and playstyles (Hence in CSN:S you can just run around with sniper rifle without getting killed) but they should have similiar stats or rather, certain minuses for certain pluses.
No matter the stats, they're in that certain grade so they should have something in common.

Ending that topic, time for last one before the overall conclusion:

- Bugs

The game is a bugfest, i won't lie but it's mainly dedicated to maps.
Maps have some unpatched spots that can be reached with certain weapons, giving people advantage over normal players (probably another reason why game got cold-water treatment but oh well, let's leave that behind.)
These kinds of bugs are mostly present on ZM maps, those created by Valve/3rd-party creators and ported to CSN:S.
So theoritically they can be patched and edited but the question raises if their creators will be okay with that.
Apparently Nexon doesn't want to take that action in fear of potential lawsuit or whatever.

Asked this question on community' Discord and got same answer.

= CONCLUSION =

The game is specific, the playerbase is small and the company that created it has pretty bad opinion in gaming community.
It's like that one friend from childhood that has grown up and changed alot while you went to another city, but for worse.
The game is heavy, has hackers, has bad opinion and is widely disliked.

One thing is certain for sure: It's super addicting.
I personally hate this game but i also cannot live without playing it.
It's just pixels but it's also a part of me, a part that i cannot let go as a gamer.

Similiar to original Counter-Strike, Half-Life or Portal: It's childhood in some form.
It's hate-love relationship.

Overall, 6/10

DISCLAIMER: 

I have left behind TONS of stuff involving free weapons, event, decoders and whatnot.
I decided not to discuss them, i'm writting this at night and i'm just half-alive.
If you have anything you wish to say, type in reply (like obviously).

Stay sharp,

[spoiler] probably because of how ridicoulus this is like, HOW IS THIS OFFICIAL?? [/spoiler]"
2292,its kinda good
2293,"This review is more a rant than a review so please don't get salty about this.

[1] Please bring the old days back! Where is the old Hero Mode when you get selected as a Hero with actually good and fair weapons?
[2] It's sickening that the game wen't 100% pay to win. 
Super over powered weapons that kill you and stun you rendering you motionless is a stinky thing about this game nowdays.
[3]This game turned into a p2w sh*tfest with a crappy ""minecraft with guns"" mode called studio mode.
You need to pay to get building guns to build faster and a ""scanner"" equally to middle click in minecraft for 7.00-- !?
[4] Very, very grindy. Most of the players play those ""farming"" maps where you barely get anything worth the time.
[5] Also the stupid anticheat that requires all the permisions of your computer is very shady. Why don't use VAC? It's not like somebody will even bother to cheat in this game.
Also why don't allow virtual machines? VAC allows virtual machines anyway and the ammount of cheaters is still the same in the games with it. Is this """"""security"""""" really secure? 

The only good mode is Shelter but they don't bother anymore with that. That makes me very sad :("
2294,"I used to play this game a while back, it was quite fun. I amassed a collection of weapons I earned but after returning to the game in 2020 it doesn't quite meet the standards of today's CS games. I played this game when it was called Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies, to show how long ago I played it. I don't enjoy it as much because it has evolved into a pay to win game that has PvE while trying to be a game in the Counter-Strike franchise. Bots were very good in old CS and made it feel like an actual public server with their chatter. Nowadays, it's just an alternative to 1.6/Condition Zero and is much more overshadowed after Global Offensive went free-to-play. I can't recommend this today."

2379,very good free cs:s
2380,"Right lads, if you're thinking of playing this game let me give you seven words that will hopefully make you reconsider. ""Please for the love of Christ don't"" 

This game is a load of shit even when you have friends to play with. Allow me to introduce you to the decoder system. 

Every new day the game rewards you for putting up with it's bullshit by giving you a free decoder. Which can either give you a new gun for a limited amount of time, Or give you a player skin. Cause no one has ever done that before. How original! 

You can use the weapon for 25 days. Or you can level up with gears and blueprints to get to an astonishing 80 days! Thanks valve! Very cool! And for the player skins, it's a mess. Those you get to keep supposedly. I got a player skin of a woman that was wearing a translucent dress. I didn't want this but for some reason the skin automatically applied itself. So for the rest of the time playing this game, I was forced to run around in the dreary. awful, and downright disgusting game world as some asian woman whom to some with poor eyes looked completely nude. Thanks Valve! Not cool at all!

Now onto the game world.

The game looks like a 3rd person perspective of someone filming an action movie with a camera whose lens was smothered in vaseline. I think they should change the tag from ""FPS"" to ""FFS"" so it reads ""For f*cks sake""

Onto zombies.

ALL THE ZOMBIES LOOK THE SAME WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SPECIAL ZOMBIES THAT LOOK LIKE THE SPECIAL ZOMBIES FROM LEFT 4 DEAD BUT IF THEY HAD DOWN SYNDROME.

When playing this game, it's important to keep in mind that what you're putting in is time. Time you could've spent with your mother. Trust me I played 126 agonizing hours of this bullshite."
2381,CANT STOP PLAYING !!
2382,"Terrible P2W and borken game, the actual cost of this game is $120+ euros. Once you paid and got the best weapon in game, you can dominate the whole battlefield. Getting 10+ kills with just simply clicking one single button, the weapons can even protect you 360 from all directions, so don't bother trying to get those P2W players in game from behind, as you will get killed instead. Game mechanics is so broken, reporting and vote kicking system is completely useless and I doubt the developers who designed those systems do actually have a brain. There's 'no option' to start a vote kick in game, the only way to kick a hacker is agreed by all players from the whole room, clicked the player name and the system will ask you whether you want to kick him about 10 times, in order to protect those p2w not easily get kicked. But.. what if there are afks? and maybe no one bother clicking the tab button and see who's being vote-kicked? so if you want to kick a player? nah, don't bother and that's why P2W players, hackers, botting, aimbot, skywalking, out of map bug, glich user.... and many more shitty things exist in this game. All legit reports are also being ignored by Nexon.

Nexon tried to cover this up by 'providing' players a customize mode in an attempt to rip off minecraft, but I can see players only using this mode for building maps for farming kills, good designs are being ignored by players most of the time.

So is it all bad? oh Nexon will give you plenty of weapons for free, yeah, finally some free stuffs! Then you will find out those weapons are completely useless in PVP after playing 1 min of a game. They literally will give you a lot to make you believe that it's not P2W, but unfortunately 95% of free weapons are useless in current meta and the remaining 5% is also outweighed by P2W weapons. For instance, a player with Heaven splitter + dual barret gunslinger+ hell hound and a dread nova can outplayed 31 zombies at the same time and P2W players will set zombie limit to normal zombie then you will confused about why you can't move at all and then got killed in less than 2 seconds for the whole round. 

Community are also toxic and selfish, after many years of developing zombie mode, Nexon still allows selfish players to block others and with the 'Anti kicking P2W players' system, you will find yourself 90% of the time being stuck then killed by zombies. And don't forget Nexon put bots in PVP rooms, those bots are also set to block any entrances intentionally. I guess the game's developers are pretty much gay or virus pandemic addicted, as they refuse to resolve 'blocking' issue so they can see around 16 people stuck in a narrow hallway then turn into zombies. Don't forget then the P2W players will 1 shot you in less than 1 second. 

Nexon also don't like updating old stuffs, many modes in this game was actually fun and have the potential to be the best part of the game. Some examples like, zombie giant, human scenario and zombie shelter, even hide and seek. However, since these modes are not likely to generate plenty of cash to Nexon so they gave up. There is almost no updates to all of the modes mentioned above except zombie shelter. (but they fked up the new map on zombie shelter too). The zombie giant was a great mode to play back to the days, as you can become zombie boss eliminating humans or as a human shooting them. However, even a zombie boss with 30k+ HP, the current meta P2W weapons can finish you in less than 3 seconds, so this mode became unplayable. Other than that, some old weapons need to be buffed eg, Janus, Balrog, Skull series but instead Nexon nerfed them all and force you to buy the P2W weapons if you want to stay in the game... 

As I have been playing this game for a while, the game was way better back to when it was first launched, no P2W, you can get useful weapons easily by just playing the game for a while. Zombie mode was not broken as well as many other modes. Sadly, now it's like a platform for P2W demonstrating how rich they are and this is no longer the counter strike loved by many players. But of course, people will still play this anyway because of the popular CS brand name and that's why the game will not die at all. 

I summarized the whole thing, if you like doing the following, this game is definitely for you!
1. Don't mind spending $120 Euros+ (this price is not 100% ensuring to get the best weapons in game, but pretty much enough for dominating zombie PVP and other PVP modes)
2. Being abused by P2W players- what I meant here is, you are not allowed to move and just let them kill you and you can't do anything about it even you have good skills
3. Exploiting bugs, gliches, flying in map mechanics (Don't worry, you won't get banned!)
4. Playing like a jerk, troll and selfish, causing other players to die/lose the game intentionally 
5. Build you own virtual world come with free gliches and bugs, but be advised that a masterpiece build map will not be noticed by 90% of players
6. Enjoy being 1 shotted 
7. Keep doing the same thing over and over again with achieving nothing (eg, playing a map 400 times to get a useless medal)

If you don't like any of those above, don't worry! You can still play this game! Don't forget they have a bot mode too! which is one of the few playable modes in this game along with zombie scenario. But you may be confused why you will download a outdated graphic game just want to play with bots (zombie scenario mode is actually killing bots too but they are just with more HP and zombie model)"

there's alot of change been made since the SG/MY server closed back in 2015.
normal weapon has been remove from the shop and has been replace with a modified version that has a rediculous overpowered stats.
normal weapon can only be craft which is totally RNG.
melee fight is boring as **** cause the premium melee weapon has 5x attack range with a super fast attack speed.
90% of cash weapon always come with 2nd abilites like rapid firing,charge shot,grenade launcher and more.
certain premium gun also has 5x more reserve ammo or in some case infinite reserve ammo.
the original mode now allow certain cash weapon which totally ruin the game balance.
character class now has a second variant with a scifi looking skin which totally not fit the game,worse thing they also include a Magical Girl character for both CT and TR.

overall the game's suck,unbalance and boring

2464,"What is Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio, formerly known as Zombies? It is a disgrace to the CS games series. 

I wish to waste as little time as possible writing about this anomaly, so I'm getting straight to the point. This is the original CS copy-paste, with different once fan-made game modes available to play, heavily modded with skins and stuff that make your monitor explode in tears when joining a game. It looks horrible because of that and it plays horrible because of that. Also, I did not manage to find one server where my ping was ok. 

From the moment you start the game you will instantly feel like starting a really, really, really old asian MMO. Do yourself a favor and don't even think about trying this... thing. Play the original, or any other CS, but not this. 

P.S. The achievements don't even work. It is the first time I see achievement with 0%. Not only that, but most of the achievements are that way. The first game I've seen like that, and after asking about it here and there I found out that the achievements are broken since forever. So yeah, thank you, CSN:S!"

This game is P2W only, Toxic community, Bad Servers, Really really sh't graphics 
They have deleted one of my accounts 
This game is not fun.
I've spent money and l regret it, l want a refund.
Do not waste your internet data downloading this game
Seriously you will regret it.
Go download CSGO get prime it's free and better than this game

If you like burning your wallet on this game l recommend this for you
If not Get Away now.

Do not come at this game.
Do not waste your life playing this.
Go do some other good things.

2575,Counter Strike 1.6 with more mods and CS:GO-like skins I play this game for years since it was known as just Counter Strike Online and is an old favorite of mine. It is a bit silly looking and a lot of pay-to-win but I still love it. It is a lot better than CS:GO in terms of customizability.

2620,negative review here
2621,wait wasnt this a zombie game years ago
2622,"This game is really great, is basicly 1.6 for free plus with extra content including the infamous Editor(estudio editor) really cool to use it, it was cool if you could like do that same editor as arma 3 and the cryengine editor for crysis 1, cause besides being less time comsuming is a better layout for editor and all. but well this game still perfect how it is."
2623,i like it
2624,"P2W if you want otherwise grind 48h a day and eventually you will get the same weapons the P2W players used a year ago (the weapons are still pretty op ngl), it's a good game if you want to chill or mess around with your friends.

8.4/10"
2625,"A very bad game should not exist this game is just sad it has developed into a bad game according to the new level system This used to be known as Counter Strike: Nexon Zombies which was fun to play without p2w weapons. it is now very difficult to find a playable server and also a fair server because, most of these players spend money on this game which is very stupid and sad. This game has lost a lot of players and is almost extinct. Most players are toxic and you have to spend money on this game to have any chance against others. And the developers are rly trying to get much money as possible. Gamemodes which i would not recommend for new players zombie hero and team deathmatch definitely wasted my time and still wasting my time the only reason why you should still play this is because you have friends."

I haved some nice memories but they were ruined. And the ""Studio"" uppdate in my opinion was just bad. CS + Minecraft? Pfff... Goodbye Counter Ass Geyson Zomdio. It was shitty to know you."

Actually, this game requires Mastering Movement, even they have Great Weapon, this requires a teamwork. Even this game many P2W Players, at least this game is free.

P.S.: After playing so much, there are no cheaters here."
2658,"This game just to play for fun with your friend if you have one but I'm not suggest playing competitive because this game have too many bullsh*t weapon which have a huge amount of damage and some kind of weird passive like knockback zombie fly half of the map with a pistol (or melee weapon), A gun which has unlimited ammo,Anime looking character(most of female character),etc..."

Just remove all anime guns please, and lower zombie health then boom we got our best CSO back"
2663,"Very fun game where you can collect more weapons and play with your friends. Unfortunately, community is extremely toxic and I do not recommend joining them. 

UPDATE: I've recently been falsely reported for ""auto-clicking"" in game from their terrible anti-cheat software. Somehow they must've updated their cheat definitions. I basically lost everything that I have gotten. They wouldn't even trust me or let me appeal in any way and blocked my account permanently. So if you want to lose progress from all of your hard work, it's your funeral."

It is like a stocks and a money management simulator.

10/10 it helped with my financial stability."

I saved (Decos) of events, saved mileage so that they took me out and didn't accept that they were wrong and I saw people with real hacks, bots that continue to play and I have seen those hackers continue to play freely but instead I enter and they give me a ban

2750,"i started playing Counter-strike Nexon:Zombies (old name) back in 2015-2016. I had another account but i lost it due to not remembering my password but man oh man, This game changed sooo muuuch.Back in my day  we used to have grades to craft weapons, less complicated guns, rewards were hard to get, and balrog-XI was one of the best weapons in the game, Yea the balrog shotgun was one of the best weapons, not m4a1 dark knight, not paladin, nothing.After some updates ""legendary weapons"" came into the game.They were included: m4a1 dark knight,desert eagle crimson hunter,Ak-47 paladin and they were soooo hard to get like litterally so haard, 1 out of 1000 players had maximum of 1 legendary weapon because they are so hard to get.And now.... overpowered guns everywhere, zombies do not even have chance to attack and other things.Atleast pleasee return the OG music , when CSNZ was first introduced. I do recommend this game for players that are looking for fun, believe me this game isn't that hard as it used to be."

2752,fucking yes
2753,I would recommend this game if you don't have gmod & also would rather do prop hunt. The hide and seek in this game is like Gmod with a twist. I haven't played the other parts to this game. I mainly use it for hide and seek. Great game so far. I've had better experiences on here than gmod.
2754,"good sheit
"
2755,Great game ;D
2756,When I came back to play and I got a error. The MOST BS is THAT ALL MY LOG-IN REWARDS AND STUFF THAT I GOT WERE GONE AND I CAN'T EVEN PLAY A SINGLE GAME OR LOBBY! Makes me wonder who's doing this. This use to be enjoyable with the zombie mode and scenario but with how everything gets taken away and makes your account restart from fresh after a few minutes just questions if this is a bots doing or someone who just takes money away after resetting a player's account.
2757,"Comfortable to play
"
2758,PADU BAK HANG
2759,Its a realy cool and fun game if u play Hide and seek
2760,OKEI
2761,"What game is this? For some reason it's in mt steam library favourites section no less, claiming i have exactly 100 minutes played.

I don't remember ever touching this game, i didn't even know this existed. >_>

Did it change name recently or something? If so, that's bad business practice... Shady as hell, can't recommend. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"

2764,"not a bad game, would recommend it"
2765,ok
2766,This is remember me To CSOI
2767,how to p2w the game
2768,what a bad game and gamedesign. free2win btw
2769,"I been gone for about 9 years, and when I reinstall the game I was wondering what had happen to all my stuff that I bought was fully gone, and when I read some reviews about the game I saw some people saying that we had to agree on something to transfer all your item to that update on that very day. I don't think this is worth the time to play this game anymore I just wasted some money on this game and I can't get my items back anymore, I love playing this game long time ago and now it stupid how they would change it. I feel like I just got robbed.."
2770,Similar to CSO that I have been playing years ago
2771,Its a  nice game
2772,"As many have stated, this game is very P2W. The ""zombie"" mode is just hold down m1 button to win (pay money to m1 faster), most other game mode is kinda abandoned by the game developer so even if you enjoy them, their state will likely be exactly the same forever.
 
They try to change it up with task each month for players to earn LOOTBOXES to get a CHANCE to win an item that let's you m1 faster in zombie mode but most of the task are trivial and it starts to show the cracks that this game hasn't aged well. Other than being a free CS 1.6, it doesn't have much of a merit on it's own. The closest you can come to a fair fight is playing on games that have classic weapon restriction, if not, prepare to get killed by a vast selection of unbalanced crap like an automatic AWP, a trip mine that is invisible, AWPs that can kill you with a leg shot and grenade launchers.

I can tell that the game developers are kind of trying to change up the game with new gamemodes and rewards for players to have incentive to play it but there is only so much you can do when you have to balance guns with unbalanced features for zombie mode but not for standard mode but zombie mode is mostly just really repetitive shoot till it dies stuff. The ""skill"" of the game is to learn how to walk backwards/forwards/sideways while holding m1 till everything dies...and then respawns again, PVP mode normally boils down to who has the most unbalanced gun in the game or that one guy who is incredibly good at the game that steamrolls the entire team cause there is no skill balancing in the game.

I really tried to like the game and I did for a short period of time. I liked playing zombie shelter but the bugs and glitches that the game developers doesn't bother fixing makes it frustrating. I also didn't feel fun after spending extensive time on the game mode only to get a mediocre reward that I could've gotten by playing a far more popular game mode that I didn't like .After playing for long, the game starts to feel like a chore, like trying to meet your quota at work but here you don't get money, you get a virtual shiny gun that kills stuff faster than other people or a shiny new virtual character model.

It's one of those games where you just start losing patience and sanity as you open the game every day to complete menial task so you can get something shiny that shoots slightly better than the other guy. That's how the game progression works and most of the time you feel like you're just standing in place. The gameplay is not fun and the rewards are crap which is what makes this game a slow descend from mediocrity to boring as hell."

2791,What even is this game anymore
2792,"you start the game only to see a bunch of Turks insulting each other's family and threatening each other to death or some guy who writes nonsense in the lobby of the game 
or you get insulted by a bunch of Turk for no reason most of the time because you infect them or kill them i can share hundreds of screenshots in which you can see them insult each other or even me for no reason i'm sick of this game and the only reason why i play it is the fact that i've spent over $1800 for this crap,
and oh god the game is filled with bugs due to the fact that they literally push the crappy game Engine to it's limits,
Free To Play? yeah sure with hundreds of in game payment craps they will make you pay like hell, sure they release some old crap for free sometimes which are EXTREMELY WEAK due to the fact that by releasing a new P2W super powered weapon zombies also get updated 
so that they can be stronger against all those Epic weapons and they think that they balance the game that way haha sure, 
sometimes they even make a new weapon and release it for free but can they be compared to the other Pay to Win sh!ts? NO WAY
stay the heck out of this game why would you waste your life in a super toxic pay to win game?"

2801,"Anime  player and gun skins, braindead schoolboyz in every game.If you want to die in real life- welcome to this game"
2802,"Greatest game out
"
2803,"All I have to say is I've loved this game ever since
I've started playing in the beginning of 2017.

The old mechanism and system were pretty much balanced 
and enjoyable for everyone in the game.
There were no lag, nor lot of effects on the weapons that made players laggy.

Just old haggy and classic looking.
Which that's what i loved about the weapons

Of course as every good game, has to make some profit out of it.
And became a lot p2w-ish since the end of 2017 i guess.

But that's not a problem because, they're trying to make it as balanced as possible still. (don't come at me with ""the game is dead"" is pretty much alive still.)

About the new leveling up system, every level up they give you free mileage and every 5 levels,
1000 mileage with some decoders.
Which makes it 10x better, Every 100 they grand i guess 10.000?... dunno tbh and a lot of decoders such as: top 50, 30 brand, and top 50 unlimited... i don't know why are you still complaining y'all.

Within the events they make, it's still worth playing and i encourage every old player to come back.
(Even after the migration)
It will be all worth, the rewards they give out from daily rewards is pretty useful for other modes as you're new.
(The even gave transcendent weapons in events)

The new systems are pretty odd and .... weird, i don't complain, but something inside me,
Misses the old things that were inside this game. Such as, hand models of zombies, humans hand models, jump increased as your evolution was increasing, dna for zombies which made you available to upgrade your zombie to better and stronger.. 
Crafting, oh goodness... 
where you had the possibility along with some blueprints to get some unique and advanced weapons... and therefore more.
 
And that even unique or advanced weapons we're good as almost the transcendence ones...
The menu was simple, the new one is better imo, you get to filter modes and rooms compatible for yourself.
I can say more but... yea. 

Thats all i had to say."
2804,"Give us back the real game....

And send this sh*t back where it comes from."
2805,"They destroyed the game with this studio mode and all these new buff weapons.... This was a great game 2-3 years ago, now..I have no words."

2818,"since the Megaxus version of the online counter strike game is closed. I looked for other similar games but then I found this game, counter strike nexon which is 100% the same as the Megaxus version. I really liked the counter strike game when I was little (I forgot what year I was certain to play this after point blank release, note I was in Indonesia). I have many friends, memories, family in the clan, even many tragedies here. and luckily there's still this game here so I can still reminisce. for all aspects of this game, I'm satisfied maybe I can add a little bit of deficiency

Hiding on the pair of crystals plain sight both of them being zombies & walking passed me which I started snickering after seeing them both. 2. scaring them half to death as the zombie of popping out of nowhere. Now present day to it's rename Counter-Strike Nexon: Studio I would recommend this to try it out to see how you like it.
2948,"i still play this and spend little money on this because i hate my life.i will not recommend this game to anyone else as this game is mainly meant for counter strike meet zombies but for you to kill zombies,you need spend ACTUAL money to get good weapons.

to even get the good weapons,you can get it from their cra ppy decoder which is essentially to gamble money to get the weapons you need to kill zombies.also,their mic quality is still cr appy as usual.not even a single change


there are some good things and that is they do give out a lot of free things but its meant for like normal modes"

An updated review for 17th March 2020 as 14th March 2020 connection problem issue


Edit screenshot : https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2024984814


Currently from SG server connection and might affect some players, has issue connection with ping 200 (normal or playable ping 30-50), 

Connecting to EU, NA, and TR has same ping about 200 too as usual, might their connection problem, not from my ISP. Why I'm writing this using review, as currently if you look at forum, they always lock for this kind of complaint, and ignore it, because that's not the place you can complain (They have their own Customer Service website), but they don't help either as they suspect my ISP is the problem. So I've warn you from this review

I'm might change again the review if they had fix it



1 November 2019 review below

TL:DR this game is clearly p2w but generous enough for new players

I also leave tips for new player below on my review

It's old CS game, but now has many unique weapon and has different class and character, also zombie mode
Their past name was Counter-Strike Nexon : Zombies because it was focus on Zombie mode and Zombie scenario (In game story), but was changed to bring more new player (According to CM on Discord and Discussion) and take interest on Studio mode. 

Studio mode is like map workshop, making map with cube (Minecraft style) and add decorations for your maps. Currently it support Original, Basic, Team Deathmatch (Also support Bot mode), Zombie Hero (Also support Bot mode), Zombie Z, Hide and Seek, and Play Mode (Free style, like making your fanfic or story). You can create and publish, make Mileage Point, from there. Sometimes the publisher has competition for Studio mode with reward such as Transcendence Weapon or Decoder. Maybe you can make your home in Studio mode for war zone or hiding place from zombie? You can have your way on Studio mode, just don't forget to test yourself and set to public

Overall, you need strong weapon, but they will giving part weapon each day of playing 10 minutes any mode, I suggest you take Thanatos 9, Brick Piece (like Uzi weapon), and Broad Divine, the rest, just take Bendita or Thunderbolt for premium enchantment, both need their own weapon to decomposed to take material.
Other way to gain weapons are Mileage Auction, which held on uncertain month, I suggest get one of from Transcendence weapon AK47 Paladin or M4A1 Dark Knight (Both around 5000 Mileage bid) to give you permanent EXP boost, so you can have more mileage later, you need to level up to gain 1000 Mileage. 

Don't forget to follow any event, sometimes they give decoder or free weapon. Usually they release super weapon until they make the counter weapon or more powerful weapon with unique mechanic, sometimes they giveaway certain old powerful weapon which never outdated, just outtrend

That's all from my review, I'm F2P currently and has strong weapon like M3 Black Dragon, Most +6 Weapon like Magnum Drill and Gae Bolg, I have all of them, it just 4 month account from closing CSO ID/MY/SG server

also my CSO ID/MY/SG account were much stronger than now currently, thank you

About enchantment, now using fodder weapon for enchantable weapon, not diassembly same weapon to gain its material, please ignore tutorial for enchantment weapon"

you play against players with guns they bought that you literally can not touch them no matter what you try
and if u get the chance to try those gun,you will see why , you literally dont have to aim just click and the gun will aim for itself (NO BS)

the only fun part of it is the Hide and seek mode"

3012,"The best Counter Strike game i ever played, but with the reward window not being closed its simply Unplayable :(."
3013,I can't really complain too much about this game but I honestly did expect something better than this. Like if you want to play multiplayer I'd say just stick to counterstrike global offensive if not an older version of counterstrike cause the gameplay of this game is basically like source (with some technology in it of course). As far as zombies it's ok and if you like zombies from tf2 or counterstrike then you'd probably enjoy the zombie modes. also the game is lobby/server based so it's a bit tricky to find games that don't have high ping's or are super laggy. I couldn't recommend this game cause I just couldn't really get into it much as I could with counterstrike source so..... Yeah
3014,This game is really good. Lots of different modes and intense matches with good weapon design and you can have your own mods and custom matches.
3015,its good and fun but i cant press the bottom menus like the mileage shop
3016,"A classic CS zombies shooter game. What more can I say? Well, this game isn't highly intensive (Graphical) either. If you're looking for a thrill, this game is pure P2W (Paid To Win). Don't bother downloading it or casually dipping your toes in it."

3025,"[h1]This is an outdated review[/h1]
mby bit more older than pre-minecraft edition:

[b]>>History:[/b]
So I played f2p Nexon zombies for ~915h because it was really fun,the knockback mechanic was the saving grace for this shitfest,most classic weapons were generally useless cuz they didn't generate enough damage or knockback though could've still see usage as support weapons.

Personally used the M3 shotgun cuz it had devastating knockback,changing the game on some maps with elevation into something that most cs1.6 zombie maps lacked and that is mobility,there you just sat in a goddamn tunnel and either cheesed the whole round cuz OP human mod weapons/utilities like for example OP weapons AND goddamn shields/armor from infection.
While Nexon zombies was solely like a fortress that could be almost invaded from every side by either zombies grenade-jumping or using some versatile abilities to manage to get to the humans,the skill was utmost needed from everyone present in that fort doing their own job. Not to mention other fantastic game modes like ""Hidden""(though it's too easy for a vet with a p2w weapon to shred the hidden within seconds defeating the point) and others.
The only gripe I had with this game was it's P2W status that I managed to circumvent not paying a dime through crafting sub-par weapons and taking part in some events that awarded me ""good weapons"" though still not enough to match p2w level which did put me off many a times from continuing to play,nonetheless I kept playing for the glorious mini-games.

The reason I'm not recommending this game is because I've ran into the issue of the Devs deleting accounts wholesale with only 13 days to opt-in to save my account because of migration from Nexon EU to Nexon KR that was aforementioned in apparently 2 months worth of notices about it,I hadn't read them or payed them any mind because I thought I'd be able to stop that process when it's taking place,and when the last 13 days struck... I just wasn't playing it,and neither do I see any sense in going back to it.

[b]>>Opinion:[/b]
Would I recommend this game for F2P?
Only if you like the minigames,they're cool though some still might have the p2w aspect,I don't imagine the p2w situation getting better from when I left(Or get used to the much more unsatisfying grind than from back then).

Would I recommend this game for players that are okay with spending money?
Sure,go on ahead,it's still a cool game for those people."
3026,nice game.
3027,"Hope u

3034, I like this game a lot. I have only level 20 and a transcendent skin lol xDD
3035,"Ah, It's nexon good old ""renting"" microtransactions for weapons, skins, etc.
Do not play the game if you want to grind for ingame cash consistently just to keep the same weapon you like for few days."

3039,This is the weirdest counter strike game I've ever played.
3040,Brought back my old memories when i was young playing this game and i really enjoy it. It is very fun to play with friends together too
3041,Thanks for deleting my account üò§üò§üò§üëå
3042,had fun
3043,Such a cool free version of Counter Strike. I don't know what is the point of getting counter strike if you can get this and play regularly and play with bots. This is literally Counter Strike Zombie Mod. There is LITERALLY PROP HUNT. You get Counter Strike AND Prop Hunt. Now you don't have to get garry's mod to play prop hunt because this game has it. This is one of the first games I have ever played on steam. I recommend this to people who can't get counter strike. I had so much fun playuing this and there is so much stuff you can do.
3044,"i am a zombie survival and fps lover having played a lot of them on the market. i can say this is far from a game i would recommend for the following reasons.

1. the graphics look outdated for even a game from 2014.
2. the game is sort of mill leading in terms of what they mean by hordes or zombies to which most people would think of Call Of Duty type of thing. this should be explained in the description.
3. way too many updates in one day to make it worth the time waiting to play it.
4. the screen size doesn't actually go as high as 2160p (not in terms of graphics quality but in just how clear the visuals look, so it looks stretched once it enlarges to that size in full screen.
5. the menu is way too small and all over the place to know where your going with too many popups. this confuses alot of people as it means they can't just start a game without spending so much time in the menu's
6. when playing the game it can make you unsure what or where your going in order to for eg. kill the zombies. and because there is not a great deal of depth of field in the sound you never really know how far you have to go and if it is above of below you.
i basically spent 10 minutes in the menu's and about 1 minute in an actual game and then uninstalled because of all these games. so for this i would not bother installing it but ill leave that choice down to you."
3045,bring back memory since i was 16 years old playing this game. its been like 7 years i play this game before i started to play csgo. quite nostalgic games to me
3046,Op
3047,this game not good
3048,"coming from the person that play multiple version of this game by far the steam version give the most weapons to player 
right now new player already have the weapons as same as the pay user but there just way too many weapons weird compare that to the old day those weapons really need a buff most weapons are very fun to use even tho like 80 % weapons in the game was design just for zombie related mode only but you can still use those in other mode but they arent effective as in zombie which is a good thing 
the player model and weapon is kind of ok to look at not too bad not to good either but it get the job done
alot of game mode to play but most of them already dead which is sad right now just zombie related mode ,TDM,gun deadmatch 
the main selling point of this game alway gonna be zombie related mode beside you never see any game where melee are as effective as gun in zombie where human chase zombie with melee for god sake at some point human even leave their defend spot just to chase down zombie 
this is not pay to win becuase i play game without spend 0 $ and still have the same ammount of tool like the pay user expect the character model 
yeah i do agree that some gun are way too weak in genral for zombie even tho those weapons are design for zombie 
after all it still CSO notthing ever change bettwen version of diffrent country it still a good game if you willing to learn to play that is"

3053,So bad that it's funny
3054,"This game is cool and has a lot of potential, just give it a try and maybe spend some bucks on it and play with the right people then you will definitely like it. 
The game has released more than 400 cool weapons, 50 classes, nearly 100 costumes and it's still releasing and it has more than 30 cool game modes. However Zombie Hero mustn't be the first mode you try because it's just not for new players and it's full of (P2W).
The game has the original CS 1.6 modes and it has the same graphics but the design of most of the weapons is just epic.
The community of this game isn't the best, you'll definitely find toxic dudes but you'll also find good players.
Lots of cool events and a good amount of free stuff.
The game isn't balanced TBH especially in zombie modes.
Some achievements/medals requires spending money or  ridiculous amount of time.
The game has a serious amount of bugs that need to be fixed.
Despite all the disadvantages, the game somehow is still enjoyable that's why it can become one of the most popular games if the developers took good care of it.
Still not sure ? Then why do you think I spent nearly 5k hours on this game xD"
3055,Good game

And i know: it's Asian, Korean but it doesn't matter in my opinion. CS is not P2W, not characters with huuuge boobs (yes, i am fucking serious) and 7DAYS GUNS which they are more powerful than normal guns. I just say - No. Even for free.

Just install CSGO or buy original CS1.6."

am gonna give the game developer 200k $ if you will close it and delete it . and ban (NXred) in your own.
and give his dad's money back to him
P2w and shitty game ...like 2 in 1 thats hard honestly"
3090,"Good game and also it's free, you basically get free 1.6 by using command cl_minmodels 1 (makes all player models be the same [default characters model in 1.6], and also ignores all costumes) in original mode with classic weapon restrictions."
3091,Old and classic same as cs 1.6  fun gameplay at all
3092,"trash lmao

A little update on the review, since someone really wants one.

To sum up this game, I'll tell you one thing. I played this when I was 12 and I somehow enjoyed it, reason being, I was a retarded kid. But from what I know and remember, this game should NOT be carrying the title of ""Counter-Strike"", as it is literally PAY TO WIN. You can purchase cases that not only can give you skins, but also WEAPONS (which can also be temporary lol).
The single fact that it's p2w already makes it get a thumbs down from me. But wait... Why did the game suddenly change from ""Zombies"" to ""Studio""? Hah, SO THE DEVS CAN CHARGE MORE MONEY IN DIFFERENT WAYS! GENIUS!
The only reason why I played this game for the tiny amount of time I did was because it was free to play and had fun zombie games, but if you have a brain, you will get the VCP (valve complete pack) for dirt cheap, download CS:S, go on a zombiemode server and have WAY more fun than you'll have here.
Need I say more? This is EA level bullshittery on Steam and a complete disgrace to CS."

Those who free to play in this game is equal nothing more than farming kill bots compare to those who paid big, so if you are poor, dont play this trash.

EDIT: They can't delete a steam review so gonna post it here (They gonna delete negative comments in discussion). Well, I just got perm banned due to the fact that I use a built in autoclick from my G602 to AFK for a playtime event in a map that is COMMUNITY CREATED SOLELY FOR AFK. Yes I admited that it is wrong. So what I gonna crying for, you ask? Well the main thing here is that I was gone for a short duration and use the auto click just that one time (10 minutes) and got BANNED for life, while my other playmate (the guild master) who is paid-big-to-win got the same ban over the third times already. Over third, why? Because they actually ghost-perm banned those who paid in this game, for how long you ask? ONE FREAKIN WEEK OR JUST LET THEM GO FREE. Yes, same term violation, but I am f2p while he spent alot of cash. You see what is wrong here now, dont you?

P.s: One of the GM that they choose for this game actually have a game VAC banned account LOL :D and they made him a GM  LOLOLOLOL"
3123,"You guys need to spend money because is pay 2 win game for over 10 years now , there's nothing gonna change that so make sure you have money or alot of time to play event and still somehow getting OP weapons for free"
3124,"So..... I'm just simply going to write a review here cuz I don't really have anything else to do.....

The game WAS decent when it got released. Rn it is just another P2W where with money you can get pretty much everything.
And another thing.... do not invest any money in this game, even if you have a fat wallet (unless you are sure that you won't leave this game, like.... ever).

Still interested? Well..... ok.... umm....
The game is basically modded CS 1.6. which includes several zombie modes, more guns, characters, ranks, ect.
If you fancy those things, then consider watching a gameplay video of some sort.... idk...

Anyway..... ye.... that is pretty much it.... still I dun recommend.... cuz did not like what they did with the game since the time I started playing.

Oh and P.S. probably not important, but at some point they had some issues with the servers and they had to change them 
+ those who wanted to keep their stuff had to send them an e-mail and I wasn't playing at that point...... which means I lost all my shiz that I got from dailies that you cannot get anymore..... cool
 But I guess that still doesen't keep players away from throwing cash in to this...."
3125,"Ironically spent $100 ish back when CSO Indonesia still operates. Nexon also didn't open data transfer service during closure on purpose to get more profit from their P2W gambling business practice. 

ZS and ZM were decent as well back then, until Nexon release more powerful zombies (with smaller hitboxes and powerful buffs) for absolutely free to use while also almost not buffing weapons to against with to encourage players to roll gachas more to obtain even powerful weapons with lower jackpot RNG probabilities.

Meanwhile TDM, Original, and Basic Mode became trainwreck with existing 'experimental' weapon releases unless if you use classic weapon only restriction. Then again, only few would rather to play it w/ Classic Weapon / Non latest Weapon only restrictions.

Knowing Nexon's bad business practice by starting to close down non mobile F2P games in order to gain better profit, it's for the best you should not spend any dime on this crap game.

So, what are pros from all negatives thought I have expressed?
+ Free classic weapons to use
+ Actually F2P as long as you only touch TDM/DM/Original/Basic Mode with Classic Weapons only restriction, including some misc. modes such as Studio Mode, Zombie File, etc.
+ Freebies can be generous at some point
+ Lots of alternatives to obtain permanent weapons despite it will involve lots of times of grinding
+ Decent amount of dedicated servers available to play across the world
+ Older weapons are cheapskates to purchase now, especially Air Buster (still not gonna buy it but yeah there's that)
+ [spoiler]Playable hs_mosque map which allows you to turn a Mosque into shooting gallery for no reason (It's actually referenced from Sultan Ahmed Mosque located in Turkey. It's also unavailable for Indonesia and SG/MY server back then to prevent religious controversial issue.)[/spoiler]

also please kill me thanks"

3127,"I can't believe it
Weapons like AKM, HK416, M16A4, AN94,etc are exclusive for VVIP ranks?
The fuck nexon?
The only reason i still play this game is the Hero Mode"
3128,After the data wipe when I wasn't playing steam games I wasn't able to agree to getting my data transferred over to the new company for the game. So I lost everything.... Years worth of progress and my favorite weapons are now all gone. It was really unfair to make a decision like that to just data wipe people who weren't able to transfer their data just because they weren't playing during that period of time. This was one of my favorite free games that I used to play on my crappy computer and coming back to it I am more disappointed than ever. I tried buying a decoder that was a premium and I was guaranteed a good weapon then it randomly disappeared while I was trying to record my decoding and that just irritated me after the data wipe and all that stuff so I quit and I am going to see if my opinion on the game changes after coming back for a third time.
3129,very fun game
3130,"Noice
"
3131,hahahahah just read the first two words and just imagine how its gonna be 1/10
3132,"W  t   f    is this?? I return to the game after a long time and my progress is gone! What happen to my freaking items?? and all the money I spent on? was there a update did this? I'm going to uninstall this game, very disappointing!        EDIT:  Seriously this game needs to give free items or characters from some quests or events, That's the only thing they can do right now for people who lost their progress! tbh I don't think they will ever give free characters... I'm never ever paying for this game again! because I had a lot of things in my lost account already.  What if something like this happens again when I'm not playing? Just NO."
3133,"is the game good? No .
the only bearable thing is only zombie scenario mode and studio mode

the game have almost zero balance 100% pay to win features
it does feel like a counter strike but with cheats.. 
for example :
A gun that have aimbot in it? ‚úî
a very long ranged melee with very fast slash? ‚úî
a gun that have aimbot with VERY big damage ? ‚úî
a gun that fires a super explosives round or a plasma cannon? ‚úî
a gun that can boost your just or fly? ‚úî
a melee that can shoot a laser beam and shockwave? ‚úî
a pistol that can do 360 degree attack and cant miss with a big knockback? ‚úî
a melee that can do 360 degrees attack? ‚úî
A pistol with aimbot features that can hit more than 1 targets at a time,have 1k dmg per shot and han hit without even see the enemies?  ‚úî

and all of those thing are hiding behind a decoder/Gacha,
As a FPS game its full of bad nexon decision that really broke the ""golden FPS rules"" like aim precision and situational awareness because the gun already has aimbot in it have have absolutely stupid range

most of the in game event that put towards those who already pay2win will have a HUGE advantage
meanwhile F2P Players must grind like a robot in order to get those rewards and its not as good as the paid ones either because almost all of the good event you basically must to spend money to get a ""progress boost"" basically

do i recommend this game? 
For the scenario and PVE. sure if you play it on easy or normal.. dont expect on hard or more because even the PVE is super pay 2 win
for overall game and poor in game system and balancing. NO

Basically this game is just compilation and collection of nexon bad decision
Rating 2/10 

UPDATE : Its getting worse. Honestly all of the epic grade weapons are basically a paid cheats now because this is the only game that if you pay for epic grade weapons you wont need to aim because the game will aim it for you"
3134,GG
3135,"was playing on sg/my server when that time was known as cso, if u remember the skull series balrog series and the janus series only? you must be a veteran like me. yeah and if u think those were p2w, then csnz brings the shit to a whole new shit level, with weapons beyond imaginable only god knows what's in nexon's ass. almost everyone in the server owns or has a premium weapon, or MUST have a paid/premium weapon to be competitive, try playing any of the zombie modes with the default ak-47 or m249 and you winning chances or survival chances is pretty much non-existent. only came to play zombie shelter with my bro because overwhelm by nostalgia cso sg/my left me when they closed the servers. do i recommend? of course no, unless you have so much money and have no where to spend and feed nexon's greed and make them rich."
3136,"After a while, I couldn't load into any games and it would kick me out. I'm giving it another shot now."

3144,Deleted every weapon I had and reseted my lv. Even Korean server never do that
3145,"Pros:
-for old players, it's a nostalgia
-eye candy characters
-nice presentation overall

Cons:
-pay2win
-there's no concept of balance in the new weapons, melees have very long range, gives me a ptsd of another broken p2w game that died recently(which i desperately tried to support even though the devs are just milking their younger players)
-they're giving away free permanent stuff, it's a sign that they are desperate and the game is dying
-the weapon knockback is too much, it needs to be reduced by 90%, the stopping power of the weapons are already too good, theres too many times where i was sent flying across the map, as if the game has its own mind lol what have u done with the goldsource engine nexon wtf
-no good maps designed for zombie mode

Additional note:
If they truly care about the players, they should look into the zombie mode in counter strike 1.6 that are constantly updated by communities, since they're the most balanced zombie mod ever.

And also to players that play this game, just play cs 1.6 modded servers, there's no point in trying to support a game that doesn't balance its items, it would make more sense if the game is only pve zombies, but this is pvp."

But other weapon which has better art/design such a crow series, skull series, balrog series and etc can't do that. Meta weapon right now only has high stun and knockback such a Dread Nova (damage nerfed, high stun & knockback), dbgs (can't kill normal zombies with 2 mags), ml (this weapon only have good stun and damage). Every weapon have their own specialty. I think you just envious to other players which own that meta weapons, so you call him op and pay2win."

But it feels very very different and I don't know if I like it or not. I've only spent like 20 minutes into the game and already I felt doubts.

I noticed that one of the gamemodes said ""Players must transform into a random object and hide from the Seeker. It's a very different kind of fun from other modes!"", so I assumed ""Oh, so it's basically like Gmod Prop Hunt? Must be fun I'll try this one"" I entered one match, and... what the fuck?

3254,"COUNTER-STRIKE NEXON: ZOMBIES is one of the worst mods CS that I've seen. The objective of the game is to a) Survive as a human and kill all zombies b) Kill humans and turn them into zombies.

Gameplay-wise, it's like CS. If human, kill zombies. If zombie kill human. If a human gets killed by a zombie, the human turns into another zombie. It's like any other Garry's Mod. The game also seems greatly botted.

Conclusion, just skip this nonsense. There's a rumour that a whole lot of former players complaining that Nexon deleted their accounts while they were playing and made them lose their money.

This game is now filled with stupidly overpowered weapons where most guns have little to no recoil at all.

3384,truly a guilty pleasure i REALLY just can't recommend others to play but i enjoy myself. i played a lot of cso2 so im kinda neturalized to the fact the entire game is just an acid trip with a dose of nexon (p2w).
3385," When I first booted up this game I was pretty excited to play a zombie based counter strike game for the first time.. but during an online match I noticed that the environments were very bland and un-creative (In my personal opinion) and pretty empty with poor looking assets, I found myself playing for a total of 10 minutes before getting bored and switching to another game... I feel like this game could be majorly improved and become something awesome, possibly including a steam workshop so people can upload exciting things like the game: 'Left for dead 2' did.

 Don't let this review spook you into not downloading it, I say give it a try and maybe you will have a completely different opinion.. so yeah.

3412,"For over a year servers are lagging. Ping goes over 2,000 and if you are very lucky it pass 3,000. This is not acceptable, not even for a free2play game. If you join a lobby without this issue, after a while it still can happen to start with unbelievable pings for all players. You only can quit from this lobby and only hope other lobby is better. With this problem you just can not play the game at all and only try to get your reward for online time and quit the game after you got it.

This issue scares most of the new players who lose interesst very fast with a non-playable game and will not return. This game starts to die and Nexon does not give anything about it. I just can not believe that a developer can care that less of their own game and only cares about new pay2win guns instead of fixing stability problems."

For F2P( Free To Play Users)
Positive: Deathmatch, Achievements, Original Modes, just require only skills(aim,game sense).
Negative: Zombie Mode mostly in Human side is P2W( Pay To Win), New,Good,Nice,Amazing,God,Overpowered Weapons = Real Money and many toxic players!
If you're here for fun it's ok, because this game is free. If you're here to have the ""best weapons"" NOT RECOMMEND.

For P2W ( Pay To Win Users)
Positive: Everything
Negative: CSNZ is smart every 6 months they add a better weapon = RIP WALLET

So in my conclusion I would say 5/10 on this game! RIP MY $$"

BUT the game act badly all time, keep freeze in most important moments, no matter what rez. you set the graphics remain poor ...

3476,"I remember starting this game in 2014, pretty old game, still kept me running for the good weapons and mods.
It offers a variety of experiences ranging from crazy PvP zombie modes, to story driven scenario missions.

3502,its not a bad game but i don't really like it
3503,"what the f*** is this game anymore,i remember playing it a few years ago with my friend it was realy fun but P2W.I dont know who is still playing this and the europe servers have been shut down,the gameplay was good and the missions were actualy fun, but the developers put a piece of s*** shop that is so dumb and overpriced.if you dont spend money on it you will lose.being a f2p player of this game i can tell you that it is hard to win,i never spent money on this piece of shit and never will.
And they also added a editor that is more like minecraft than counter strike games and also looks like crap.
I wish i could say something good about this game but it got so bad,it is only good playing with a friend but how many times i lost my account because of the bad developers i just cant play this.
I would recoment it before the stupid map edditor but well.
NEVER PLAY IT PLEASE IF YOU DONT WANT TO GET BORED IN A MINUTE"
3504,Quite laggy and really not a good game with that being said your much better off with csgo since it's free but gives new experience.
3505,This Game is Very Good
3506,When did i play this game i've never even launched it why do i have 50 hours please help
3507,I Like It  But They need Fix  the Graphics
3508,its fun but i havent played it in a long time
3509,It is a good game to play if you like zombies and counter strike. If you dont like zombies then there is non zombie modes.
3510,The Game is very cool but the Graphics naahh
3511,yuh cuh dis bih go mad hard
3512,"Well Hello, I want to write a review for the game Counter strike nexon zombies but we start 1 this is a Good side of the game:
+Old nice graphics of CS 1.6 the Old model put it up for a great game
+A wide range of languages in the game including Russian Spanish and so on
=A wide variety of weapons of other things but here it can be called otherwise and bad and good Donat in the game is very large sometimes there is an imbalance in the game
+A large number of game modes

------------------------------------
and now let's move on to the bad qualities of the game!
-as I said it Donat, it is a lot here and it gives a big imbalance in the game
-problems with servers are the same in terms of ping and lag is rare of course but still the game is considered a minus
-The imbalance donation items and weapons from powerful popular guns in the game just dizbalans to be the big powerful weapons purchased in the store kills the game from what the game is unreal as the leader is the one who is more"
3513,"I had 1398 hours on this freaking game, and spent money more than I'd say 75% of the player, because I was into this game, I loved it, until, nexon made the greatest decision on earth, when they decided to delete everybody's account without noticing us; yes, they did, but you have to log into the game to know, unfortunately i wasn't playing this game at all during that period of time. Then, when I logged in, all i knew was the account got deleted for no reason, not until I searched on google few months after, says the server of EU is closing down( with no convincing reason, like why are you shutting it done, and why the f**k are you shutting down NA server with it). They absolutely did not make enough effort to let fellow players know that this was going on, not everybody is logging into every single day to check whats going on in the game, at least make a ad on youtube or something let people know CSNZ servers are closing or anything else, maybe on google, make a cheap news on google search page, nothing, they did not care about us, who was temporarily out of the game for sometime. Then, all you see are these stupid response from them, says something like ""sorry, the migrating period is over, the server is deleted, no data is saved, nothing else can be done for lost account."" i wonder where all these money we paid you gone to, not even a back up little server just to save our data for a little longer? there is definitely something you can done with the money you make, so over all don't spend money on this game is the lesson, or don't play it at all, nexon's games are selfish and disgusting. I awfully regret that  I spent so much money on this shitty ""free game"" so called. F**K NEXON."
3514,When you're too poor to afford CS:GO
3515,"Before it was VERY VERY better, There was cases from lvls and that was fair, Now its SO MUCH P2W . I have like 400 hours on that and i left the game for  ONLY one year or more, And when i come back. POOF i have NO LVL i questioned ppl why i have no lvl? an they said it was lvl and they from their lvls got HIGHER. And i can say, I GOT NOTHING."
3516,good game
3517,"Its like Counter-Strike!
If it was made my a brain-dead Russian on crack."
3518,"its actually not even that bad for a free game that can run on a nokia
"
3519,"[Indonesia]
Sequel yang menarik dari Counter-Strike Side Series yang dibawakan oleh NEXON. Yang suka fantasi zombie dengan senjata fantasi yang menarik, sangatlah unik memainkan game ini.

However a new player might not want  to play it unless they are wiling to shell out a couple bucks, the game is quite pay to win with all the op weapons and unbalanced combat, there are ways to get good weapons for free but it involves a lot of grinding so if you don't like wasting your life then i would recommend against this game."

3531,this is cs 1.6

2nd part fo the review:

I dont normally do this part because there is no need in most cases, but this game is such a fucking typical P2W i have to say something. I only played it for about 10 hours and the game is so fucking boring that a bus drive from New York to LA without stopping is more entertainging than this piece of shit. If you dont spend money on this game, you dont get shit. The worst guns in the game are given to you at the start and theyre not even permanent. You have to fucking pay to make them permanent. The lag on the servers is so bad i wanted to vomit. The Gameplay is so chaotic you would need lightning speed reflexes to do anything and dont die in about 3 seconds from the round starting. The game runs on Gold Source (Half Life engine), but it looks like a really bad PS2 game. 

Overall rating : Fallout76 / 10"
3544,"Recently, I love playing this game. It has so many gamemodes, weapons, maps, etc. It's like CS 1.6 but heavily updated adding a bunch of new stuff in the game. But there's one problem, it's P2W. You have to buy stuff in order to get new items, I wouldn't really recommend wasting your money on expensive items. But the game is okay."

3555,"Recommended, only for the modes other than human vs human. You'll find better environment in other games if you want a basic gun vs gun matches.
(I usually play Soccer, Gun Deathmatch, and Zombie Z)

Also heavy P2W for some modes, though you can work out through them, but not at early stages."

I highly recommend this game to every fan of the Counter Strike series."
3611,"this. game. is. DEAD


that was the summary, the longer story was that, i grew up with this game, when i was in china and played it like its the GOD as a kid, and when i immigrated to US i found this game on steam and was very happy to continue to play, now they updated with some random BS and non-sence, they took away the excitement where u camp in the vent and at both ends u try to shoot the zombie down, they killed the part where u camp on the roof of italy and use hammer to knock the zombies off, all of those memories are now gone. less and less player play, all the teamm8 u met are gone, dont know what happened, or who fked it up for everyone, this game is dead."
3612,.
3613,played this before i even played cs:s or cs:go still recommend it if you want skins that will never be in csgo
3614,this game can compete with battel rolay games as it has good weapon desin its a good game people think its pay to win even tho you don't have to pay it there choice thos who say it is are worng i have had the game for awhile  and i don't see its 2 ways you ethir go free all the way or pay its your choice not the devopors falt they aren't forceing you as for the menue they aren't the poeple who made counter strike but this game is better the gamplay is great the graphics are a bit old looking but i don't care as long as the game can copanste for some of the porblems i say its a good game sure there is a learning curve but they are doing some thing new in the gameing inudsure and i am sure that i haven't see a game as good as this (sorry for my grammer i don't speak elnish well) but the after playing the game i say i recommend it and should alest get some word out there because its sad that some that played are not reviewing the game right and they are bing toxic as if it has nothing to compastne the problems but it does all they are doing are looking past the things that can keep the game up and yet they spred misinformation
3615,the game is good but its too pay 2 win
3616,bad
3617,"When this first came out it was a cheesy kind of fun game that was really fun, now it's strait up just pay 2 win and is laking any fun factors."
3618,"The game is very heavy on micro-transactions, but none are required to have skill. The new zombie modes are fun, and the sense of community through the in-game level editor and quick match-making really increase the play-ability. The players are generally competitive but want to have fun. Definitely a good game, especially for people with low-end computers who want a new experience."
3619,veri najs :D <3 jebani vroat XD
3620,the good old days
3621,ok
3622,gw
3623,"Well, well, well, this is the WORST FPS of all time. I started playing it in 2016, it was a really cool game with lots of gamemodes and guns. Even though it was always P2W there was always a chance to win these players who bought cheat items from shop and anyway it was fun. I liked playing classic gamemodes and also zombie scenarios, it was so interesting. The game was averaging like 2-3k players which was a lot. But then I don't remember the year, probably 2018 everything changed.

The servers of the game moved to another country and you know what? You had 2 or 4 weeks to join into the game and accept the transfer or your account would be COMPLETELY ERASED without refund. I didn't even know about it, so I lost my 50lvl account with lots of premium permanent guns, skins, sprays and other stuff which I got from playing a lot and opening free cases (decoders), never donated to the game, but imagine those people who spent their money on it and in the end they got nothing.

All the cons are here:
-Account erase (happened once and will happen again, because devs ain't give a fvck about their game, that's why the game was so bad already at that time and they became bankrupts so they were obliged to move their servers to another company or office)
-The worst hit registration like you play on 5 tickrate server
-P2W (could be okay but not in this case)
-The worst performance, the game fullfilled of sh*t and runs poorly even on high-end PCs

DO NOT TRY TO PLAY THIS, don't spend your time on it, because anyway in the end of the day your account can be just erased :)

The concept is lit, my hope is that Valve re-release CS Nexon: Zombies on their CS:GO engine, or they add all the stuff from CSN:Z to CS:GO, of course leave the classic competitive mods without all the P2W and everything, just add all the gamemodes and guns into the game and make them in the different tab. It would be so fun to play zombie scenarios again."
3624,counter strike with anime titties

3626,fuckin counter strike minecraft offensive
3627,Nice game
3628,thanks nexon and valve corporation for deleting my account for nothing you did very good
3629,pretty good game
3630,This game is for people that are poor and cant afford CS:GO but like csgo is free so y would u play this game or maybe u play cause ur pc is dodo which makes sense but it is a good game anyways
3631,I love this game. He realy coll
3632,"This game is an absolute nightmare, and I am not talking about its immersion.


Pros:

This game can be a lot of fun if, one, you have a big group of friends that play this game, two, those friends don't end up buying there way through this game, three, you have no other standards.

Cons:

The first thing I am going to address here is the fact that this game is a pay to win style game. After launching the game you will be given a taste of their decoder casino which 95% of the time will give you a limited time to use a random gun you don't have unlocked yet. 

Progression in this game is one of the most insulting excuse of a progression system I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Every 5 or 10 levels you get a nice looking gift just to find out its 5 decoders and clinical depression when you find out you have wasted this much time on this game. There is also a blueprint and gear system which allows you to craft weapons rather than gamble for them however at its peak you can get one of these exclusive weapons for 80 days rather than 25.

Game play is not a redeeming factor either, with most of its player base playing private games you will most likely end up playing Dust II Deathmatch where the Counter Terrorist spawn is camped like it is Return of the Jedi on opening night. Usually in a good Counter Strike game when you encounter an enemy chances are just in much your favor as theirs depending on the situation, however in this game chances are you are going to be murdered by a weapon that looks like it was made in during an acid trip and coded by a 9 year old on scratch.com. Who needs tactics when you $200 to burn.


Overall I would recommend that you stay clear of this poor excuse of digital entertainment. Whatever you do, don't let the free to play aspect of this game entice you to play it because with out a doubt I would rather do a open heart surgery on myself while playing Roblox while listing to I play pokemon go every day at 100% volume."
3633,Probaly the worst game to date. It can barley even run
3634,nb
3635,en si como otras rese√±as opino que este juego dejo la esencia que tenia cuando comenz√≥ que aunque yo no fu√≠ de los primeron en jugarlo si tuve la oportinidad de haberlo jugando en una epoca muy buena en donde las armas eran balanceadas y muy buenas ahora solo es un pay to win me gustaria que los desarrolladores hagan cosas que regresen a el juego a como estaba cuando comenzo ..... el proyecto es muy bueno pro debe dejar de  ser pay to win
3636,One of the worst games I've played 10/10 would not play again
3637,"Awesome game, great mechanics, interesting storyline, top tier weapons and amazing characters, fun game modes"
3638,Wow
3639,value kno wassup. good game
3640,i love this game because it reminds me of cs 1.6 and the custom zombie mode
3641,holy fucking shit where has this fucking game been all my godamn life.....thank you so much all i ever wanted was counterstrike zombies mode since day 1.
3642,"Great Game , Specially The Weapons Moding and zombie Characters it's Great
and also there's the normal mode for those who want to play Counter Strike 1.6 For Free"
3643,8/10 Too Many Zombos
3644,2022 and wtf happened with this game? It's so bad!
3645,epic
3646,"Very dated engine, not very fun, very pay-to-win."
3647,"[UPDATE TO PREVIOUS COMMENT]
Just when I thought this game couldn't get any worst, Nexon does it, brilliantly enrolling an update making the game lagging more and FPS drop badly, not to forget how they ruined the Zombie Z mode which is unplayable anymore. In my own honest opinion, a 5 year old child can make a better game than developers at Nexon, haha!!!!!

This game used to be one of the best games on steam but after many updates, well, things went down hill.
FPS drops drastically especially when players use flashlights and there are no console commands to disable those graphics that cause FPS drops and lag:
- Servers are most of the time lagging and going down, DDOS attacks I assume.
- Epic Weapons special effects and graphics blind you.
- Only OpenGL is available for Video configuration and it crashes a lot!

On the other hand, the Studio mode is fun and it does not lag that much because you control most of the details that affect the performance of the map like lightning, textures, etc... where nexon is failing to do with maps that are decades old now, for instance the Italy and Assault maps.

When other players use flashlights , well, you are blinded from all the bright lights around you and most players do that on purpose to win a game.

I have been playing Valve's games like Half-life and CS since the 90s and I have never faced any issue even on computers that have no graphic cards and this is the only game where my processor is at 100% using 1 core only!! Again, another area where nexon fails again, they update the graphics and worsen the performance. If you run the game and open Windows Task Manager, then check out the CPU Usage under the performance tab, you will see that only 1 CPU is working at high rate while the rest is low instead of spreading the processing to all available CPUs.

Overall, I am not an expert, just observing and giving my own opinion. If you want to play a game that is free, go ahead and have some fun but word of advice, don't spend money, not worth it at all."
3648,I somehow enjoyed dis shit back then
3649,"It's a pretty P2W game but still fun if you manage to get into a game without a lot of people that pay, it has tons of weapons and stuff to do."
3650,this is my fav game ever i would recomend only for vac banned poeple only bcuz well u know
3651,"Good game, it has everything that a counter-strike game needs, but kinda hard to get extension coupons to make custom weapons permanent, i'd like if you make it just a bit easier, like 20 percent or something like that. :-)"
3652,"good game but you cant play :/

3657,a nice and fun game if you like zombies and shooting
3658,looking back and knowing i played this gives me cancer. + all my account data is gone so no point in installing to laugh at it. RIP
3659,"I have played this game for a fairly long time now, I have spent a ton of money on this game to acquire fancy weapons & characters which they keep releasing and promoting every few months... and finally I have come to realize that this game is indeed an utter pay-to-win BS! None of the weapons you get to obtain for free are comparable to the ones you get by paying, there's 0 chance of you surviving a round on zombie mode if you have not even got a decent weapon, which ofcourse has to be paid for! Depending on your luck you might be gambling all of your hard earned money away on decoders. Barely any English speakers. People are toxic as hell. The game is dying ofcourse, so for anyone looking to try this game out, please don't. Look away!

3661,This is just a really bad flip of cs source zombies
3662,updates the box art more than anything else
3663,"The game is very good, it is Counter-Strike 1.6 + Zombie mod assembly. The game is interesting of course you can play
There are many things: cool missions, weapons, characters and more.
I recommend the game !!!"
3664,This game is hot garbage and is a ripoff mix of CSGO and minecraft!
3665,"Honestly,
This game is alright if you just wanna re-experience the C.S 1.6 Zombies, but the game is still dog shit and you shouldn't play it."
3666,good game
3667,bom
3668,"After reading a lot of negative reviews, i downloaded the game (I did not play it for 5 years). 

Everything i had is gone. My special knife, (that i crafted or got somewhere, i don't even remember.) that was really rare. 
Every weapon, just everything.

I give a thumbs down for the game for doing this.

The game was good itself way back before, so i leave it 5/10.
"
3669,y
3670,this game is ok
3671,very fun to just mess around in
3672,what
3673,Hell to the naaaaaaaa!
3674,"There are a number of reasons why I hate this game.  One being the menu is so confusing.  Compared to CS:GO's simple menu, this game is a nightmare.  There is a huge learning curve for new players, and it is not a fun experience.  Do not play this game."
3675,"Worst cs game ever cuz its p2w
"
3676,this is one of the worst games ever made it should not have CS in the title don't even download it there are better F2P games out there like CSGO it's F2P and better then this
3677,played the game for a while and spent some money on it and now everything is gone because i just happened to not transfer during the one month that they allowed the transfers of accounts which is horse crap since i wasnt playing at the time i didnt know i had to accept the T.A.C. so now all the money and time spent playing the game was thrown away by default never going to play the game again
3678,"i cant believe i used to waste thousands of hours on this game. If your pc is somewhat decent, please avoid this game at all cost. It is out dated and the only community supporting this game is probably just some latinos."
3679,"Its a very Nice Game with  cool Guns and also cute and nice animation which is my favourite..

"
3680,"Shit game, sucks. Boring and nothing special. Don't waste your time."
3681,"Help!

When I go to fullscreen mode, my screen flickers and I don't know how to fix it, while in windowed mode, it doesn't!
Help me!"
3682,this game is fun but prepare to fight your way out of silver
3683,"it would be more zombies in General the price was not. The atmosphere class the plot, too, nothing, but want, to more types of mutants was."
3684,I could play Minecraft on my Dead Grandmas Old Toaster and it would make more fun.
3685,Great Game
3686,minecraft modpacks can do better than that

 Cant Stop Thinking about How the game used to be even if its pay to win now 

hopeing one day it will change"
3688,The game sadly isn't the same anymore.
3689,"It's too laggy,bro ffs i have an intel i5 gen 4 with 8gb ram and it runs like 40-20 fps...wtf bro...even cs go it runs like 90-100 fps...it's trash."
3690,The game's ight.
3691,This game is so bad it borders on being dank.  It was not worth the 5-10 minutes to download and install.  Save yourself the time and effort and pass over this game.
3692,cs 1.6 with new modes
3693,"Git good
"
3694,The only reason I ever played this was because I couldn't afford CSGO all the years back.
3695,Bad.
3696,"A classic zombie FPS game that has existed for 10 years. I hope the updates will be more frequent though. Get more new players with more free new content, Nexon."
3697,"Not good at all, nice guns and all but horrible game, the tutorials are great, but the real game, the zombies have so much health, and you can basically only play as a zombie if you want to play, and the team deathmatch is horrible, so if ur here for a tdm, go to csgo, or some cod games."
3698,Ya it's a cool 1.6
3699,Nice Game
3700,Cool game it's cs go history. I just don't have anything bad to say about this game
3701,why this only works on window
3702,HELL NO!!!!
3703,"Well, game is good. Maybe fix some bugs and it will be better. When I wanted to play with friend on my studio map, he's game crashed."
3704,is alright for a few hours i guess..
3705,"GOOD GAME
"
3706,"Im glad i didn't spend a penny on this horrible game.
Had a lvl 64 account, with a free given AK Paladin, all gone. Not even a fookin mail was sent. 
Scam developers, Scam game, Scam community. 
Go buy CS1.6 is million ways better than this piece of shit."
3707,Trash
3708,"stay away from this game, its overrated and if you wanna win then you're gonna open your wallet, maps are badly done and so are the weapons."
3709,god game
3710,"idk why i have this much hours spent on this games but aight, this game is an retarded cousin of the cs family, its p2w and just terrible, also you will prolly get a chinese bitcoin miner on ur pc if you install this shit"
3711,way too old but still I guess If you've got nothing to do it's a good game to spend time on. Not a game where you should take it seriously and keep playing

3727,Nice game !
3728,this game is so fun with all the custom wepons zombies and gamemodes
3729,"This game was a masterpiece if you ask me, back with his OLD and cooler name :)
I can say this game is a dogshit p2w game that is not worth it playing anymore, years ago this was pretty much my favourite game, my main game also and...by time passing nexon needed some more money..? Meaning less players...LIKE NO PLAYERS cuz this game is dead at this point.
Really loved the fact that by playing you could've gotten NORMAL Decoders wich we're the most balanced and the coolest where you just needed luck on them. Dark Knight and Paladin we're like the best weapons ingame, along with Magnum Drill and like Thanathos-9. Right now thoose are SO GOD DAMN EASY TO GET, and at the same time, they are terrible. Only way to ""enjoy"" is to spend all ur life savings on op decoders and get shit weapons like Gungnir and Tiger Sniper or idk more  p2w weapons they add (do i have to mention DPS and Gungnir again? :) and thats not the only problem. But yeah in conclusion don't play this game you'll prolly suffer on it as much as i did when they destroyed it but...happened so just let the collectors play the game for the sake of having a huge account on a big game :).
Wish you the best and thanks for wasting ur time reading my review."

EDIT  (Dec 2019):  Nothing is changed, everything behind paywall. NA player base is basically dead. Overpowered weapons, Stay Away....

EDIT: (Aug 2020): Lmfao they still milking this game hard via microtransactions with decoders.......
 
EDIT: (Oct 2020): LMFAO This game's microtransaction make EA and COD's lootboxes more worth.

EDIT: (AUG 2021): Game still have the same broken ass OP guns as updates, store is uesless, relies on p2w decoders. STAY AWAY.

EDIT: (AUG 2022): Game is filled with OP and BROKEN AS F**K Weapons. Weapons like Quantum Horizon are SUPER BROKEN and make zombies useless. Dont bother. Although weapons are easier to obtain but YOU will get OUTCLASSED by P2W players EASILY."

3743,"if you dont spend any money then all you can use is the crap weapons, to get a rare you need to buy decoder, but sometimes you could land up open ¬£200 decoders and get nothing but crap."

3745,nah

3747,Nice game
3748,"Do yourself a favor and do not play this. Yes it is true that it's fun, but the game is heavily pay2win.

I Went In A Match On Double Gate On Hard Nine & When I Wanted To Get One Of My OP Weapons & Go Guns & Blazes On Those Zombies, I Couldn't Find My Weapons, Only A Few & They Weren't Even Permanent Nor OP, I Thought It Was A Bug Or Somethin' Like That But When The Fifth Round Ended, I Went To My Inventory & BOOM. . . . Nothing. . . . I Stared With A Blank Face For Like A Minute Without Even Blinking Once At My Empty & Basic Colors The Classic Weapons Had Without Seeing A Single Colorful & Beatiful Weapon, Thank You Very Mutch Nexon For Making Me Waste 175/176 Hours Into This Game For Literally Nothin', Also I Saw That You Migrated In Korea & I Hope It Was The North Korea & Kim Jong-Un Is Now Raping That ""Nexon"" Company Of Yours As Well As You."

3782,"Back in 2015-2016 this game could actually be considered mediocre-decent, however recently because of all the pay to win extra over the top anime bullshit Nexon has been adding within the last 2 years, it's turned this game into a somehow unfinished glitchy pay 2 win mess, Although it was nice how they handed out a bunch of free stuff back earlier this year that dosen't outweigh the bad that plagues this game, and don't even get me started on the community either toxic ass 10 year olds who used their mums credit card to buy hundreds of those god damn scratch tickets or nerdy korean hackers who somehow make enjoyment in hacking on a dead game, also the new ""minecraft"" update is completely underwhelming and just plagues the game with more unneeded crap, honestly it would be much better for this games apparently non existent life cycle to stop development as a whole or revert to a previous update within the past 2 years and fix all the god damn bugs this game has.               P.S: Still better than free to play CS:go though :)"

3790,This game was so fun at one point. Me and some friends would play this shit all the time. I had over 50+ hours in this game on another account. Though this game is a cash grab for a company that won't update their games anymore. Valve has dropped bad. And this game shows that. Not recommended anymore. But if you got a time machine. Go back to 2016 and have a good time.

3831,not bad but.....
3832,I LIKE THAT!!!!!!!!
3833,"Even though I put in so many hours in this game, I would not recommend to a friend because this game is 100% pay-to-win. If you just want to enjoy some modes like zombie scenario, fun, etc, and you don't mind losing every time, then this will be enjoyable for you. Otherwise, don't even start playing because a few rich d**kheads will ruin your game, and there are plenty of 'whales' already. 

Not to mention majority of the players are from other countries so you will mostly--if not always--have latency of at least 130, and up to 400. Only few players from North America actually host a room."

3844,"Never really played much of the game, so I can't commentate that much on it, but I can definetely say I enjoyed the other CS games better, and if you read the reviews you can see the game is plagued by bugs and pay-to-win techniques. I was planning on still giving it a positive review since it's free and calling it ""the poor man's Counter-Strike"", but then Global Offensive went free."
3845,Good Game !
3846,"I never actually got to play the game, so I can't leave a review based on that, but even without having played the game I had problems.

The anti-cheat that it needed to install used up all of the RAM, and would start on computer startup and run in the background, slowing the computer down to a crawl. It was impossible to close with task manager, as it just kept reopening, and it took forever to find the file to delete.

The game itself never actually opened. Steam would go through the startup, and then would say it was running, but no new application would open."

3871,4 mins was all I needed to realize that Nexon screwed up one of the greatest series of all time. Literally looks worse and PLAYS WORSE than the original CounterStrike from 1998. I'll stick with Zombies on CSS. Much better game mode.
3872,"i will start from saying that i played it for fun with some friends, i had nice weapons and skins, but i don't understand why they deleted my account and now that i want to try it again i need to start another time with basic weapons, it's impossible with the weapons that the game gives you to play against this overpowered zombies with 20k hp and you with your weapon that with 200 bullets make only 6/7 k damage....it's a completely p2w and for some stupid moves from nexon they mixed the servers so now you lag like shit.....but it also has flows"

3925,This game is amazing but one problem that Im facing is that i bout an item recently by mistake and Im trying to get a refund and i haven't used it yet so please if the developers are seeing this can i get a refund because i bout the wrong item.

3944,very low end copy of CS source... Not recommendable imho
3945,"I like this game , he is P2W in zombie mod except if you are a tryharder 
The serv are laggy and its just suck in human vs human 
The zombie's community is so fcking casu , they just take a cheated map for humain , block every good zombie and ragequit if you kill them. What a good community !
This game still a based skill game so if you lose , its not the fault of ur weapon but ur fault.
btw , i can't play since the update of 01/02/20


(tips : Human vs Human , if u are a noob just take the ""Famas in burst fire mod"" or the ""MP5""
Zombie : juste try to bop with a light zombie or to slow down a human with the Stamper
and the best weapon for a new player are : XM1014 and MP5 )

i wish you a good fun & a good day"
3946,this is one of those types of games where you just play it every once in a great while simply because you're bored.
3947,trahs
3948,it`s a ripe off cs soure
3949,One of the worst fps's I've ever seen in my entire life that is terrible on ever aspect aside from being terrible.
3950,"im a classic player to this game, any one else a clasic?, well you lost all your achivment's when they updated to the new format, personally it piss's me off, had alot of rare type wepon's now gota do a dam scrach and kick just to get a pistol
"
3951,good game counter nike nexon non nombes
3952,Got used to it spent alot of time on it But its changed the Graphics may be Garbage But honestly if you needed to kill time and didn't care what you played and you had no friends like me this was the game
3953,"TLDR; I got a more powerful pc after almost a year of not playing, and now the game hangs so much its unplayable, on a more powerful pc.


I last played this almost a year ago. Since then, I've gotten a better pc. I had absolutely 0 performance issues on the crappy laptop I had before. However. On this new pc the game is unplayable. No matter what mode i join. Or if I'm hosting. And no matter what video setting I have in place. The game just kees sticking and hanging every 5 or so seconds and by the time it unsticks I am already dead. I have no clue what you guys did to this game, but it should have no problem running on my new pc if it could run on a crappy laptop just a year ealier. Oh. And wheres all my progress?"
3954,"It does not work, after you install it gives error message "" It needs steam instelled"". Obviously it is installed steam"
3955,"Nice, I paid some actual money in this game for stuff and they just wipe everything.
It's a Nexon thing, apparently."
3956,7.5/10
3957,Shit game.
3958,You would at least expect more gamemodes like Swarm GunXP and Classic Biohazard from a standalone Zombie mode game.
3959,"Nigga this game is trash.

3964,This is an amazing game. I highly recommend it.
3965,i lost my will to live
3966,"(ok to begin this short review my English is not my first language and I'm trying to improve my grammar mostly) Counter strike 1.6 is still my favorite of all time I have never enjoyed it so much but when it comes nexon zombies, I gotta admit the game literally freezes and the sounds is kinda weird in zombie scenarios, however the big anime tiddies is forgivable in my book but other than that I don't know what's the point of it since all the free to play zombie games like for example nmirh is more enjoyable. It doesn't deserve the cs name for it, in my opinion,  but if it was different name I won't mind.  it's not recommended for cs fans, fast paced zombie kick ass simulator (l4d2), and weebs

- the gameplay is ok
Why I don't:
- loud initial settings
- quite hard tbh

3982,i would review if i could launch the game! the thing says this game requirs steam i am launching forem steam PLs help
3983,"My head still hurts from all the sounds in the last Zombie scenario match i've played
God it was a disaster"
3984,"So, do you know those shooters like Operation 7 where pay2win is a main mechanic because you use real money to RENT gear that will merely give you a chance against players who use real-life money?
This is basically it, just that with anime and other edgy models/weapons wich where probably stolen from the community."

3992,Zombies arnt really scary
3993,"No bueno for you. Remember to turn down your sound for the giant death robot, as its lasers sound like a deepfried despacito remix. Other than that, if you spend money on skins you have the smallest of small dick energy :D. The drill gun will carry you through the entire game though"
3994,"its frikking amazing. last boos in the first level is pretty incredibly well done and very nice !! wil recomend. he step big on you its very sick very very very very very good game thank you gaben for this amazing game :)

4014,"This game is good and bad on so many levels.



Graphics:

The game is common to lag. i got a pc that would fit a 2006 pc rig
and it laggs. i know this is a game from 2012, but its a goldsrc game. a game never lagged so much not counting payday2 on my pc, than this game. 




Studio Mode:

A gamemode that was fun! its literallty the only good part about this buggy game! its a mode able to make maps and other cool stuff.


Zombies:


The HP is so unballanced. u get over 1000 HP. it just doesnt fit.





The ""Zombie Scenario"":

When i first played, i was always clogged with zombies. Its like they wanted u to die, but ur health keeps going up, so whats the point of even having the mode?





Summary:
the game is only reccomended to play for the studio mode the rest is shit."

4033,"I find this game to be a good idea on paper, a good idea in practice. But the thing that annoys me is that I find the Main Menu very confusing and hard to navigate. And I kinda dislike how the when on the Main Menu, the game runs in a window. I might also find this to be the culprit for getting into a game longer. If Nexon (Or Valve) could fix this, then sure, I'll give the game a thumbs up. But for now, it has my disapproval."

They have the same game manu screen, exactly the same, The SHOP , INVENTORY, even they have same rules guns and items with durations, even what i have seen that this cs nexon is not succesful at all, the only difference between wolfteam and nexon, is that wolfteam human and wolves, but this human and zombies.
But i swear its exact copy of wolfteam game, try wolfteam and see, 

Both games stands for THE MORE YOU DO PAY, THE MORE OF WINNING RATE. = PAY TO WIN. character with extra armor stats, weapons does more damage. extra cheating abilities u can use only if u pay. like its sucks, when u look for free game to play but you dont enjoy it because its not fair. 

Like dota2 , league of legend , overwatch, fornite these games are free to play expect overwatch but an example of skills to win, fair and free 100%."

This is Harley King...logging off."
4057,"and now its a Meh Anime
Thanks Nexon."
4058,"Your weapons expire and you need to grind for tokens to extend it. Basic functions like changing name or even vote kicking are locked behind store. Zombie scenario mode (the only zombie mode with players) is cringy and repetetive, you run around and kill randomly spawning zombies while turning valves or defending an area. In PvP you get spawncamped by enemy team with P2W weapons like airstrikes, flamethrowers or auto-aiming pistols (they let you perform reaper's ultimate ability from overwatch)

Garbage P2W game disguised as Counter-Strike."

4060,what even is this game
4061,yes it is good plz donate me weaposn or mney on m pussy wallet

4070,nice
4071,"Good game, only fun with friends though for me."
4072,P2W to get good guns and obviously being very old game it's got mediocre graphics and gameplay. But more importantly a massive amount of the playerbase had their inventory removed because apparently they moved the users game data and people who didn't agree to have it transferred got their entire inventory permanently removed and they didn't give refunds. This may go down as the scummiest thing I've ever seen a company do and I'm disappointed it didn't get the company shut down with how little notice they gave people before they did this.
4073,counterstrike + minecraft
4074,pretty shit
4075,Don't bother with this game. It's the most P2W game I've ever played.

"
4078,good game
4079,"I do not even understand how this even appeared on Steam.
It looks like cheap quickie with really awful main manu. Basically, it is CS 1.6 with zombie mod and P2W mechanics.

Defenetely do not recommend, as there are plenty other free zombie games that made with much higher quality."

4097,"Don't download this game based on the advertising. It's incredibly deceptive. The advertising shows a lot of content that is in the game, but it doesn't tell you that this content must be purchased using real-world money. In particular, all the cool looking player models you can see in the promotional materials must be bought using real world cash. This includes literally every single female character model. I wouldn't go as far as to accuse Nexon of sexism, but I will say that they are perfectly happy to reach for your wallet if you want to play as a member of your own sex (if you are female). 

Furthermore, many beneficial items can be bought outright, which means that this game is in effect, pay-2-win. If you want to open your wallet as soon as you install the game, you can get good items without even playing. 

Now, I do understand how free-2-play games work. They need to make money somehow, and so they add microtransactions. However, some games do this well, other games do this poorly. This game is an example of the latter. When you decide to put *all* the cosmetic items behind a paywall, (including the entire female sex, as stated above), AND you allow people to pay for a measurable in-game advantage, you promote a game enviroment where the people with the most money, rather than the most skill, have better looking and better equipped characters."
4098,This game is great and i dont understend why this game get this so many hate it is just  free version of counter-strike  for poor with great zombie mode  better then counter-strike 1.6 zombie mod

This game is the only CSO English game, the only CSO game that can be optained for non Asian regions because the rest of CSO games are Asian and can't be optained, unless you are living in Asia.
I personally think this game deserve many good reviews, i played over 1000 hours recorded this game and i'm still playing because is very interesting and never boring unlike other fps game after playing  a few time getting bored.
Personally i hate the player who write bad reviews and they didn't even  play enough to understand the game or know how to play.There are haters the ones who are bad at fps  and zombies games
and they blame their lack of gaming  on this game and write bad reviews for no reason.
I Think this wonderful game is not pay to win as they say, I say this game is fair you can pay a few money for good items.
For the payers who throw the blame on game  because they don't have luck at decoders:The game is not guilty for your bad luck at game or decoders and don't write silly bad reviews for dumb reason.
My opinion this game is only Counter Strike Online that is  in English for Us,we need to appreciate this game and hard work of developers."

4158,"This was my old review of this game.[spoiler] [strike]Pay2win but fun.[/strike] [/spoiler]
My time spent in the game and lost money for items and weapons. I know I spent 200h which seems to you a little for many of you. (Since many have 1k hours). The first few hours I played played a very interesting game until I learned that the game was actually pay2win. And now I can say I'm an idiot because I spent so much time on a dead pay2win game. All my progress has been reset since I do not know why and I really do not care about the reason. Because of this I will put thumbs down. Because the game forces you to charm and spend money to face enemies. And if anyone ever wonders: ""Is it worth playing Counter Strike: Nexon Zombies?"" And the answer is no. Time spent for nothing. And become Frustrated because the game does not have the right development. [spoiler]If you have another opinion, write down below.[/spoiler]"
4159,As the time goes by the game getting shit
4160,GG
4161,E misto jocul!!!!
4162,"Game not very bed, no noy vere good. Game nice"
4163,"Pay to win game...just 7-30 days weapons, if u want an unlimited u gonna pay..shame on u"
4164,"I love this game because i love mods, i don't know why everyone hate this game lol...!"
4165,"Edit and tl;dr:
The game is free, for fans of the genre and CS in general I would say try it, but don't try to pry in too much, it's just not worth it. Literally pay-to-win mechanics in the form of loot boxes which are pretty expensive and constantly coming out with better weaponry. Just when you thought you caught up with the trend - you get left behind again and there are items that cannot be obtained by any means necessary unless you pay. It does have it's charm - mashing zombies with cool overpowered weapons, feeling strong, and collecting rare items - but for the most part only for a certain period of time and NOT forever. The game has players but the attention is pretty one-sided, centered towards certain game modes. It has a leveling system and the game releases events which reward even free-to-play players but not enough. Overall - don't.

Score - 4.5/10

Counter-strike Nexon: Zombies is a free to play game, and you don't have to pay anything and still be able to play it with accessing almost all of its features, however there is a pay to win factor - decoders. They are like chests/loot boxes, whatever you want to call them and they give you the new weapons and classes most of the time. If you are veteran on the original Counter-strike and know one or two things, then you should be fine even in the zombie modes, but keep in mind there are lot of people who pay a lot, and receive all the good stuff a lot faster and secure. Also there are some weapons that you can't get unless you pay - premium weapons. On the other side the developers give a lot of free stuff as well- weapons, decoders, classes, costumes, currency on occasionally often events in which you just have to play ( most of the time ) . So I can say fair enough. The balance in the game is fair enough as well, if you keep in mind all the overpowered weapons, which can be surpassed. It offers a great variety of gameplay choices, but to be honest, recently the most popular and played ones are zombie hero, original ( pretty much old CS with no extra rules, or op weapons ) and here and there zombie escape, or deathmatches. The overall population is pretty decent, even nowadays and the community is pretty good as well, as long as you find the right family ( kind of like a guild or team ) or room ( server ), but ofc there are those cases where people in the age of 10-12 years old appear or just someone who is really pissed off the game, or his life and lets out everything, but to be honest, those kind of players are everywhere so...yeah. In conclusion I want to say that I recommend the game and I personally really enjoy and love it, and while I rage sometimes too, over being oneshoted, I cool off pretty fast. The amount of skill you have is rewarding pretty often, and even being f2p can offer you some good weapons and items, which are to your taste, as long as you are patient, and have a little bit of luck. Just to add I am a f2p, except 20$ that i put into the game, which were really paid off with good luck, and everything else is f2playing for like a 4-5 months and I have some of the best weapons in game, a whole new class, and some really cool accessories as well, playing at events or just receiving rewards out of the blue. If you have read everything and reached this point then I thank you very much dear lady or gentleman! :)"

Too much p2win,p2 progress and that sucks so badly.Its pretty empty too as you don't see many players anymore so not much lobbies.Sad.Was a fantastic game when it came to EUROPE,but now is insanily p2win and quite empty too.

Greedy company as usual."
4186,"My mental state has reached a point I fidn this ruined chinese minecraft-strike 1.6 Zombies Ultra mega tities for 13‚Ç¨ game... kinda neat xƒê

So lemme sum it up a bit :D

PROS:
-None
CONS:
-I think the developers are on drugs and I like their way of thinking 

OVERALL INFO:
Graphics: This folder is empty (I don't care for graphics tbh but for u thirsty boys il write it)
Gameplay: WTF IS GOING ON -Me 31.8.2021 on Nexon Zombies 
UI- Chinese 
Type: FPS, Football game, RPG, Sex simulator, Furry wannabe, Anime..... You get the point is cs.16 on LSD !

IS IT WORTH PLAYING ?
Y e s, and lemme tell ya why... This game is so damn quirky and all over the place... It's a very unique experiance... even gmod can't best this... the game itself doesn't know what it wants to be... and the developers are on drugs and are heavily focused on the asian-eastern European market (Russia & Balkans)... but then again... it's fun to jsut kill so many zombies... or ffs you can play the original cs.16... FOR FREE :ƒê

Imma give this game a solid 7/10 for effort and quirkyness








ALSO NEXON STOP YOUR DEVELOPER DRUG ABUSE AND TELL THEM I WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME IN 1920x1080 in W i d e s c r e e n MODE WITHOUT HALF OF MY SCREEN MISSING ! So ye ya gotta play in lower res saddly for now .W.
100/10 experiance"
4187,"Edit: Yeah nevermind CS:GO is free this game is done


After 400 hours of playing including more hours on another account, I have decided to write a fully detailed review of this game. I will be going over the pros and cons of Counter Strike: Nexon Zombies. This may be a long review so bear with me on this.
I'm going to start with the pros of this game to keep this review on sort of a positive note.

    Pros: One of the pros of this game is that it is absolutely free. This makes it the only game in the Counter Strike series that is actually free. But while it also being free it is the only counter strike game as far as I know with DLC. Another pro I have for this game as it sort of combines the layouts of multiple CS games prior to this. 

     With the core gun look coming from Condition Zero, along with the gun looks. There are a lot more looks that are borrowed from previous installments and added to this game. Adding on to the pros this game has a multitude of modes. This game is absolutely full of modes and things to play as. Which for other cs games having it only pushed to a few modes (If you don't include community maps and modes etc.) This leaves room for a lot of time to be put into this game without the ability of getting bored on paper. While this is a good thing on paper it does have some flaws which I will go over during the cons. 
    Finally the last pro would be that it has more guns than in any other cs game. Nexon went all out on this game when it came to guns. It has almost infinitely more guns and to get them all would take a great amount of time. However this is also a major con, but I will keep things positive here. The guns all have different ideas and looks to them and different purposes of said guns. Even have a lazer shooting pistol apparently made by aliens. This is something you will never find in any other CS game. 

     Now with all of these positives you might be thinking, ""Hey this game seems excellent, what can really be that bad about it?"". Sadly there are a lot of cons holding this game back from being amazing. I will go over them now.

Cons: So time to start for the first con and this is probably one of the biggest. The first con for this game would be gun balancing. I brought up in the Pros that there were a lot of guns. However there is little balancing to any of the guns. With little spray pattern to any of them. A lot of the guns either being absolutely overpowered to the point of being able to shoot through solid walls with only small damage debuffs. With other guns being to the point of being so bad they are basically unusable. The hit registration on this game is also extremely broken and nasty. Me having an uncountable of times when shots should have registered or should have hit.
     If Nexon would decide to actually stop making more guns and try to balance all the guns to where they arent absolutely op and terrible. It would definitely improve the experience of this game. Now for the next Con this con would be the absolutely terrible system of doing things. If you are wondering what I'm referring to I'm talking about the kicking, matchmaking, and other basic elements in the game. 
    The kicking system looks like a pretty cut and clean system but what hides underneath of it is a terrible and flawed algorithm. it requires an extensive amount of votes to kick anyone and just like csgo if literally 3 people vote no on a team of around 15 the vote will cancel and the kick will fail. Now there is a matchmaking system to where you can queue for a game. However everytime I try to go in it the time it tremendously long and to be honest would just be better if it were removed and just continued the manual searching. 
    This con was personally devastating to multiple people which was the server migration. The migration in general was just messy, and terribly flawed. If you were inactive in the time of the migration all of your items every single one of them would be gone. Nexon should have allowed support tickets for any loss of items but sadly that was not the case. Another con for the game would be that new players would be forced to play against higher levels. This will often lead to a high lack of fun for newer players having their extremely underpowered base guns going against guns that can literally shoot through walls. 

   There are more pros and cons to this game however I will end this review on my ending note. My ending note on this game is that it has the ability to be an excellent game. It probably has the most potential of any cs game to become one of the greats. This game just really needs to be polished and edited to where guns are more balanced and everything is fixed. I am expecting great things for the ranked mode once it comes out I will edit my review once it goes live. 
Thank you for reading this review, and I hope you have a good day."
4188,what the hell

4196,E buna pe o joca gratis
4197,"The game is dead due to the events that happened on april 25, 2018. On that day, migration of accounts to a differnt server for all accounts happened, but you needed to accept a terms of service for your account to be ""saved"". Sadly since i was not informed like many other people, lost my account and lost an Ak-47 paladin, which was the only reason i kept on playing this game. I will remember all the fun times i had playing this game.

Thank you, Nexon for this fun ride."

4206,"Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is a FPS game with alot of game mode, Allstar, Zombie and more. With No **** make the game even more fun. But the thing that make the game bad is a pay to win type of game. That make you get bored with an day or a weak time of play. I give up to play Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies after 17.2 hrs of gameplay. So i dont really recommend this game for ""free to play"" type of people but ""pay to win"" you gonna love it. So yeah dont download Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies it u dont want to put some money in there !"
4207,"good. good. good. The zombie hero mode is already near impossible to new players though, This game requires skill, and money, too. lol, fun game anyways."
4208,This game is pretty thicc not gonna lie...
4209,I lost my character model that i bought with my money and now its gone and every weapon i had is now gone i liked the game till the update happened please give us back our items
4210,"[b]I've lost count of how many times I was intrigued to play this game![/b] When I first played it, I never knew what I was supposed to do, but they've created gamemodes [u]specifically[/u] for noobies who are not quite familiar with how the game works. 

From surviving the endless Undead to creating your own fun maze on new maps, Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies offers nothing but the best shooter and survival horror experience with tons of Scenarios, Deathmatches, Weapons, Customization, Characters, Gamemodes, and more!"

4215,"This crap deleted all my account info because of a ""Migration of servers"" like fucks sake i even spent money on this bs and i wanted to come back to the game but no, no skins, no good guns, no level, no stats. Thanks for screwing me over. Oh yeah btw, if you close the game you have to go to task manager and close down ""Internet Explorer"" when you expand the thingy. Like wow. 460 hours wasted. Aim is worse than in csgo, and the bs support. Do not play this game."
4216,Nice game.
4217,nice
4218,Shit
4219,"Nice game, definitely whiter than me."
4220,me lo estoy instalando si no me funciona cuelgo a nexon por los huevos
4221,AWESOME GAME! i really enjoy it but the only thing is can u buy weapons from the shop using points because i have lots of points and i would be happy to buy weapons with my points!
4222,"Pretty cool game, and its free tho"
4223,"This Game Is Really Fun 
"
4224,nice gam3 :)
4225,This game is absolutely horrible. If you thought a game couldn't try to clone CS:1.6 and make it worse then download this.
4226,"A wonderfully retro adapted fps, perfect for grind-core players.
I have not met a better input for achievement and collection.
You have access to collectables labeled decoders that have a small chance to give permanent weapons, perfect for gamblers.
I do admit I miss the weapons crafting system with durables and what not, but what can you do?
The actually huge variety of gamemodes leaves the game endless with discovery.
Once all is done, you have all the guns you want, level, and boredom depleted, you will have even more to look forward to at the benefit of the structuralized updating schedule, NOT TO MENTION THE AMAZING DAILY DISTRIBUTION FEATURES.
To sum up, great fps, would love to see more."
4227,Nice game
4228,"Alright boys, i think i have to say that this game is doing better now. My first review was a negative because they screwd up with some server migration. But anyway, I gave it a thought and a second try, since it is my lovely, deary CS1.6. And i have to say It felt good. I had fun even in the zombie modes where as i remember was a p2w situation. I got a lot of stuff for the time i played and a chance to compete with the 'rich' bois. 
I love the Zombie Z mode because i can randomly get weapons that i don't have. I love the mutations but im not sure if it's better to get them randomly, i think it would be cool if i can choose and combine my mutations (maybe different varieties on different levels or something like that).
The new Prop hunt like mode is quite fun. Needs some more work on it in my opinion, but its a fresh breeze for now.
There's an auction from time to time, which is pretty helpful for people with no good weapons or money for them.
There are many modes you can play, especially with more than 2 friends it could be a lot of fun. (i know half of them blocked you when you downloaded this game dont worry, dont cry, its okay)
And last but not least. I like the skins and the henta! but I really wish they add the old CS models. Do you remember them? The white camo T guys, and the cool one with the shades and the rambo one... and the CT GIGN with the ski mask. The british CT is kinda similar to the old one so its cool. But yeah... add them.. even as a skin for $."
4229,i done with Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies they take all my shit that so fuck up and i had put alot of money in the game to so yea  -_- Uninstall
4230,Why my Acc is delete im bet for this game 300$ and now my acc is delete Why?????????
4231,it cute
4232,"Hiyaaa, 
GIVE ME BACK MY FUCKING DECODERS 
than you!"
4233,"The new update makes my daily rewards unclaimeble, i dont get anything. Any help or support?"
4234,Get it out of my library please!!!!!!!
4235,"Basecally the game is dying. Only P2W is fun part for this game, but no one else will like it in this way. It's just waste  of money on it that u can to do more fun things on other games. NOT RECOMMANDED THX!!!!"
4236,"Counter-Strike NEXON: zombie is in my opinion a great free to play game. If you like killing zombies in an multiplayer  experience with intrigue weapons, this is the game for you. In the beginning you might not understand it but you get the idea of how to play. The graphics aren't that good but it's not a bad game. KEEP IN MIND, IT'S A FREE TO PLAY GAME."
4237,"If your extremeley bored, go play this game, you enjoy it like for 10 minutes before uninstalling it"
4238,Its fun to play a little bit with friends every now and again
4239,"
My account was deleted, why did I donate to this account?"
4240,"[b] Pros: [/b]
Free CS 1.6, apperently.
Loads of maps that you can play. (That are only chosen by Nexon themselves. (There is de_dust2 though!))

[b] Cons: [/b]
It's very P2W. (Buy our decoders for $1 to get a weapon that will only last 15-90 days!)
No custom maps. You can only play ""custom"" maps in Studio mode.

[b] Conclusion: [/b]
It's only fun with friends, either than that, it's really damn boring and they haven't even added new maps to few game modes. (i.e Zombie Shelter)
[spoiler] Unrelated note: I am better in CS:GO, rather than Nexon. [/spoiler]"
4241,"At first it was alright, but now it's literally Minecraft Call Of Duty Zombies"
4242,"Shit game. Pay to win. Textures is similar to CS 1.6. Why Valve haven't sued them is a mystery.

Edit: Only thing i kinda liked is the football mode which can be fun when you're in a lobby with a few people."
4243,"Just going to say from the start, that the actual GAME itself isn't that bad, and if you have friends to play with its a good time.  The graphics are old but that doesn't take away from it and gives it uniqueness.  If you play with randoms in PvE you wont have the best time, but PvP and you'll still have enjoyment on your own.  

Now that my opinion on the game itself is here, lets adress why I STRONGLY reccomend you NOT to download this game, or at the very least to NOT support the developers. 

A few months ago this game underwent a server migration which you can read more about here ---> https://steamcommunity.com/games/273110/announcements/detail/1655510866879925331
In this migration, if you didn't notice the notification for it so you could opt into the migration, everything you had would be 'PERMANENTLY DELETED'.  This meaning, if you spent any money wether it be $0.29 or $100 worth of guns, characters, accessories, etc. would be wiped as well.  Had this company even CARED about their player base, they could at least issue the value of in-game items to what you spent over the years of you playing the game to anyone who sent in a support ticket with proof of how much they had spent in game.  I myself sent in a ticket with this issue and provided the information of how much I had spent along with my steam purchase history to prove that it was to CSNZ, I was greeted with a copy/paste response saying how it was MY fault and that they can't do anything about it.  From the poor decision of this company, MANY players lost hundreds even THOUSANDS of hours worth of grinding for, levels, equipment, guns, and characters.  This decision had absolutely ZERO thought and NO respect for the players, put your time into a game where the developers would at least allow you to keep the things you've accumulated over time."
4244,"Let's be real...
The game is slowly dying and it is visible after checking in from time to time to see if they have changed the game from pay to win to at least something more decent.
Shooting mechanics are still the same... kinda sloppy. Nothing really has changed apart from the  
overpowered guns they added for people to spend money on just to satisfy themselves. Several hundreds of hours wasted on a game that ended up pay to win after several staff members leaving and resulting in sever merging overtime."
4245,wallet empty now
4246,The only reason i have as many hours that I do on this game is because it froze and I couldn't turn off my computer. Let that tell you how good this game is.
4247,"*sees video* *thinks it was a messup* *sees grenade launcher in minecraft bootleg* *rubs eyes* *still there* 
*jon tron voice* me: STOP! *more bootleg gameplay* me: NO NONO NONONONO..."
4248,"Ok soo. CSNZ now is pretty much unplayable. Why u might ask?
First. They add so many new weapons with so amazing mechanics wich is prety cool but they are hardly optainable (unless u spend 100$).
Second. With all those new weapons and mechanics the zombies recive no updates. The chance of zombie team wining is super low cause of the super broken stuff thats added every patch.

If u like to grind hours of playtime and to strech the limits of ur patience then ill recomend the game but in its current state the game is not ok.  (Usually ull join a server full of ppl who wasted 1000$ on the game and have everything maxed out and all the 1 shot weapons and if u get infected u are going to have a bad time)

Oh yeah they added Minecraft mode wich is prty good id say but that does not fix the gme.


I want to see big buffs for the zombies + to make all the weapons available for the F2P .

All in all Dont play it

EDIT: I forgot to mention that i asked the staff to give me free stuff for my birthday and they didnt ;(

EDIT 17.8.2018
Ok soo Idk why but for some reason Nexon wants to delete the top 50 and top50 premium decoder fromt he inv of the players. That means if ya spent 20$ on top 50 decoders and if they are unused untill 4.9.18 theyll get deleted and bye bye 20$ 
Doe ive never red the Terms of Use so idk if they have the rights to do that and im too lazy to check soo if somebody gets intrested please let me know what ya found.
(Nexon if ya are reading this. I hope your other games does ot recive the same CSNZ treatment cause the thing y are doing with CSNZ is simply illegal)"
4249,veri naise game but itsa dying

4252,"Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is a cheap ripoff and a mix between a couple of games: 
- Counter-Strike Series (the concept
- Roblox (building, destroying shit)
- Left 4 Dead series (Zombies)
- Goat Simulator (Buggy and glitchy, difference is, CSN: Zombies isn't fun bugs and glitches)

This game is a litteral piece of ass, I dislike the game so much because it's literally all of those 4 games I just mentioned but then with a sprinkle of shit, this game is the definition of a bad game. Not only does it rip off the Counter-Strike franchise, but it's also full with these micro-transactions and damn expensive DLC's that don't make sense.
Don't play this game, although it's free and it has the Counter-Strike name, don't!"
4253,good game  :)
4254,"Okay,after 50 hours in this game i can safely say it is NOT pay 2 win sure you can buy all the items at the beginning but if you play the game level up you can open reward boxes which give you weapons,multiple items and more! and you also get even more free items by just logging in daily! so my final opinion: CS:NZ is a fun free to play first person shooter which is a blast to play with friends"

Gameplay : 3/10

Only thing that may make this game playable is its huge diversity in game modes but most of them are terrible anyway."

The account got deleted because i did not accept the new agbs (didnt startet if for like 2 or 3 months thats why i wasnt able to accept them soon enough)... this just shows what a shitty company they really are... it was never a good game but i was able to have some fun playing it... well i wrote this review because of the recent incident of them deleting my account and tbh they would deserve negativ reviews  even if they would not have deleted everyone account who dosnt accepted the recently updated agbs... in the end i wont even miss the game...

4309,"good
"
4310,"Even tough zombies , its trash."
4311,"This game has not aged well at all, this game is one of the worst games on Steam, this game deserves to be free. Nobody deserves to make profit off this piece of crap of a game."
4312,"After 120 hours in 3 years almost of playtime,this is my conclusion:
It is NOT p2w at all,you can still play normally if you don't put money into the game.
It is slow to progress thru the game,but you still do progress.

And many other stuff,negative and possitive.

The only problem i have with the game is that my account got vanished,i have no idea what happened to it,today when i wanted to play again,it just didn't work and it put me to create a new account,even if it gave me 24 day daily reward apparently,i wish the developers wouldn't just wipe inactive accounts randomly,if there was a mixed recomendation i would give this game that,overall a solid 5/10."

Today to get new gun you must pay at least 50 euro, with luck. When you had removed crafting that game has been FU*CKING PAY TO WIN confirmed. Nexon please give us that old cool weapon obtaining system ! ;( R.I.P"
4321,They deleted my account without any warning. Never EVER give Nexon money. They will screw you any chance they get.

In other word reset. I had really much good weapons, character and i had a lot of fun with my friends, too. I didn¬¥t got a email that my acc was reset or about the migration. Now its all gone and they cant bring back the acc. Really wasted the Play hours for noting."

4324,"Still looking for people to recommend this game ? There is no positive for this game at all

Playing games earn weapon, and Nexon deleted the account so you can go back to Lv 1 and buy more stuff from them. 
They knew the game is dying so they trying to milk the shit up.
They deleted our hard earn weapon, level, gears and more and not trying to fixing it, but they do add up new fking reward when you lv 1 to lv 5 they will give you the 50% off discont in the fking store, so you can fking buy more decoder and buy back your account.

You think this is it ?
No there are more and more issue with the game.

Hacker paradise
P2W zombie weapons

I wouldn't be surprised if the game dies in the next 1 year.

200% not recommend 

if you want to wasted your time
if you want to get fked by the hacker
if you want to spend some moeny

4333,"Wasted potential it could really be awesome game, i played this in 2016 a bit and now just checked to see that game is dead, 700 players online. What else to expect when many people lost their accounts, there are millions of weapons and other items which are OP so it's obviously still same free to play but pay to win, that's what greed does. There aren't many maps, some modes have just few maps and not a single new one was ever made, gameplay gets too boring as there are few modes which are played the most, and only few same maps repeating. Also the maps could have been so much improved atleast with new spots or something cause you can't even jump on 99% spots where you'd like to go, it's just blocked and you are forced to go on same 1-2 spots on every single map, example cs_italy same old crap, camping on balcony until round is over. And yeah one more thing, comunity horrible, barely a single english speaker and majority of them do not coopearate at all in co-op modes which makes sense as remainings of comunity are bunch of south american 3rd world country baboons."

This is a fun game, CS for free amoungst other game mode's, though a mostly dead game there are still people that play, at least last time I was on which was around half a year ago and you can get bunches of stuff for free by playing it a decent bit, or by simply getting the daily log in stuff's and have a good time, the weapon's this game has are far past amazing!

4385,This game is just horrible.Rather play csgo zombies than this.
4386,this is a cs game..... with pay to win
4387,this game is fucking trash
4388,"Been playing on and off for a few years, fun game but you just have to get over the instant one shot kill guns people abuse like the War Hammer storm giant, no one can swing a hammer that big that fast. Or the Cyclone laser pistol which requires no aiming since it has no recoil. Or the Sniper that shoots a star at you and has perfect accuracy too. There Is a original mode you can play with new weapons disabled. Also the Survival Zombie Shelter Team death match mode is ok. I have never bought any items but have a decent arsenal of guns at my disposal still. If you want stuff like the no recoil STG lycan you have to save all the free milage decoders for months to get them which I never do. TDM is a slaughter cause everyone goes T and pins the CT in the spawn and camps with snipers. The gun deathmatch mode is ok. Just dont come in expecting people to be decent honorable players because some of them have been playing this game since it was 1.6. Over all its fun, free and a good waste of time but I would not reccomend spending money on it unless you have disposale income. Also if you playing any original functions, prepare to camp on Dust 2 for the rest of your life."
4389,Nice game.
4390,free CS with zombies and a classic modded feeling...
4391,It takes  ages to find a game its massievely pay2win
4392,"Do Not Get Sucked in! 
DO NOT!
**EXTREMELY PAY TO WIN**

  I am warning you now, this game is hyper pay to win and generally not a good experience. There is more than enough free FPS zombie and coop PvP games on steam to supplement this one. 

  The game is primarily monetized by a system called ""decoders"" these said ""decoders"" are essentially just loot boxes with god awful chances of you getting anything you want. The kicker is rather than most games only giving you a cosmetic item, these loot boxes give you weapons and items that directly affect your weapon stats. With the top weapons being extremely over powered locked behind a large CHANCE BASED PAYWALL. 

  In conclusion this game used to be respectable and a great time with friends with a small ""fun"" loot box experience which devolved into a entirely pay to win monetization model. Also keep in mind that if you drop money on this game (like I did) there is no way to get your money back or any return on investment like there is with CSGO, as this game has no steam inventory or marketplace. Like i said above just don't waste your time or money on this game, take it from someone who has spent $$$ and time in this P2W shitshow."
4393,"If you ask me, I absolutely don't care about p2w. It's the skill that requires victory, which I have. I've played CSO before, which is basically the same thing. The reason I don't care about p2w in this game is because paying doesn't give you much other than slightly better guns and gay a$$ skins. Also I can pretty much wreck majority of the p2winners as this game requires SKILL before MONEY. You can't expect a newcomer with all the skins and weapons permanently unlocked to play like a professinoal, can you?

Other than that, it's a perfect game. I just love the rich variety of in-game features you can try out. It also has an outstanding harmony of the old-school Counter Strike with the slightly newer game modes. Absolutely would recommend. Great game."

4403,"#WHY.DO.PEOPLE.LIKE.THIS.GAME?

First of all, WTF is with all the over 1000 hours players? Are people really that desperate?

Nexion Zombies is just an old school CS:GO game from the early 2000's that has been revamped in a few ways. Just take a quick look at the gameplay, it's from the ""stone age."" Yes, I know it is free, but the only work that has been put into the game has to do with microtransactions.


 If you truly want a good FPS zombie game, just pay for it. Here are a few popular zombie games that are very good.

1. Call of Duty World at War (referring to the old school mod king) -------- { $19.99}
    OK Multiplayer, OK Campaign, GREAT Nazi Zombie mods :)

2. Killing Floor 1 or 2 -------- { [1] $19.99, [2] $29.99}
    Fast paced, Unreal Engine gameplay, GREAT Multiplayer :)

3. Left For Dead 1 or 2 -------- { [1] $19.99, [2] $19.99}
    GOOD Multiplayer, GOOD Campaign, GREAT with friends :)

4. Nazi Zombie Army 1 or 2 -------- { [1] $14.99, [2] $14.99}
    Lots of shooting, GREAT with friends, Overall...good :)

Just as a heads up, many of these games are oftenly on sale....sooooo just keep an eye out."
4404,"I'd say I recommend it, the reason why is that considering Nexon is going to give it to Korans now, we should have the same items and everything on CSO as well.

The servers will still be the same for all Europeans, Russians and North/South American people.

Although this game is entirely P2W, you can still get really good weapons with the current event going on.
Basically a 40x Top50 Decoder boost w/ a free weapon that gives you boost, you can't possibly say ""That's bad."" to it.

Multiplayer is meh, a lot of turkish people and russians in a server sometimes that gets annoying but other than that this game is good if you loved CS 1.6, and you can still play your favorite modes in the game for FREE.

I'm giving it 7/10 because of hardly any good ways to get good weapons unless you buy stuff in it, but the gameplay is hella fun."
4405,"1. Zombies mode just isn‚Äôt my cup of tea
2. Possibly P2W
3. Just not worth grinding when everything besides stock has a expiration date"
4406,Give back the crafting method and then mayble i will play this game again.
4407,its a good game but can you make more skins plz

4409,"What even is this game? It's a somehow laggier, worse looking, bot-ridden, shitified version of CS 1.6 that no one asked for."
4410,interesting
4411,"Normally old games have the advantage of a gameplay focus and rewards based on skill. Smaller studios tend to be able to experiment more and give a unique experience that no big studio could.

This game is neither. It's old, but feels like a phone app with all the microtransactions. And it's basically just CS zombies with extra features."

The mode that is your standard counter-terrorists versus terrorists works okay but the zombie modes are just awful and it's clear the focus of this game is on the zombie content. The Zombie Infection mode is really boring and the Zombie Scenario mode is one of the hardest things I have ever played and I was playing on normal. You would need a fully lobby with a solid team to have even a chance of beating it. The football mode is awful too.

If you want to torture yourself with the Zombie Scenario mode then look no further than Counter Strike: Nexon Zombies.

4447,"Although most of the West side of the gaming community feels as if this game is horrible, I personally feel as if Nexon Zombies was created for those who like Asian Online Gaming. May sound ridiculous, but I personally feel as if it is true.

Somethings to note
-Rewarded weapons can be permanent, but most won't last forever. These weapons last for a set amount of days.
-Some weapons are overpowered, but know that you can still headshot the user.
-Similar to Crossfire, grinding is needed to get good items sometimes
-Not all the time is there a game mode with desired amount of players, but Original, Basic, and Team Deatmatch have good amount of players.
-The inventory system isn't as ambitious as Crossfire (thank god)

That is just some of the things about Online games in general. So if you want to play, know that this is infact a Asian online game.

But otherwise, this game is great, and I recommend if you like games like this."

2 years of grinding in this game has pretty much got me some of the best items that one could have, Yet the problem is that the game is just pure p2w. U may ask ""how ?"" It's just simple, Getting the flashiest items (Wether by paying or grinding) Will end up nothing as the devs will introduce newer (And more borken!) Items or classes to the game a week later.
Items aside, The game itself (And mostly zombie modes) Is just a cancerous camping simulator. U should just see that urself to understand.
At the end I quit. But it's funny cuz I didn't leave this game because of the problems listed above, I left cuz of the weird dev choices(Destryoing the best UI and  matchmaking system for NO REAL reason whatesoever!)

4499,Pretty fun
4500,"This game is basically a downgraded version of Condition Zero. It uses the same models for player characters, some weapons (Scout, Krieg, AK and others), with some having improved textures, as well as the intelligent Hostage AI from CZ, with the facial animations included. However, the Hostages themselves have been dumbed down, as they never attempt to escape on their own as they did in CZ. Instead, they just stay in place (like 1.6) and move around like CZ when following a CT. They don't return to their spawnpoint either when threatened by a T.

In terms of weaponry the game doesn't have the Tactical Shield, which is known to be in both CZ and 1.6, probably removed so they can sell it or something. The weapon favourites from CSS make an appearance in CSNZ as well, except they're 5 shared for both teams, rather than 4 for each team (which totalled in 8). The buy menu Packages from are completely absent. There are new weapons added such as different melee weapons and pistols, but these were NOT balanced correctly.

The AK-12, for instance, is literally an AK-47 with a huge magazine and the same recoil pattern, except 3 times smaller. And the price in the buy menu? Stays the same. It also felt like the damage output was greater, but I can't confirm that. Other weapons, such as the Hammer, are outright useless. Shooting the P90 in CSNZ feels like shooting a bloody pea shooter. It's weak, inaccurate, and the most expensive SMG.

Then comes in the character models. The females are always 10 times more expensive than males, and it makes sense why that is the case. Not only are the hitboxes smaller, but the skins all look the same in-game, so you can't confirm what is an enemy and what is a friendly unless you look at the radar, which takes much more time than just looking and shooting. This makes the game impossible to play.

Bot matches are included, and while you can play on them, the bots are braindead and easy to kill in droves. Not only that but the friendlies NEVER SHUT UP. It's the most annoying thing ever. Oh and the game allows people to keep spamming you invitations to their server rooms which is just annoying as all hell.

The tutorials don't teach you nearly enough for you to be able to play the game. It's just movement and basic stuff, no practice other than the Bot matches you can do outside of the tutorial.

Zombie mode is the worst part of the game. Don't even bother.

So why do I recommend this game, even after defecating on it thoroughly? Because, overall, as a free alternative to proper Counter-Strike games, it serves it's purpose. If you have CS:CZ, it's a downgrade. If you have CS 1.6, you're not missing out on much. Just stick to the main series games and forget this game even exists.

EDIT: The game maxes out your mouse sensitivity whenever you open it, and doesn't revert it back to where it was. It also crashes from time to time. In my 3.7 hours, it crashed 5 times."

4544,"Hello,
I've been playing this game for years now and from all those years I learned how to play this game well.. but.. From all the things developers add to this game that is bad is the Overpowering weapons which makes this game unfun to play and P2W basically. I know there needs to be an income for workers on the game.. but there doesn't need to be an unfair play style involved which makes people leave your games. The weapons which were mostly unfair to players when they were added to the game are - Rune Blade and basically aug guardian. As well as being able to upgrade other OP weapons to +6 is putting things too far. I know the point of adding extra things to the game. But that doesn't always mean it will make the game better. All the cool as they say updates developers made are for PAID users only that can afford getting the best things. To other players it makes the game unfun and unfair. My K/D is over 66% my W/L is over 60% but when playing against bad players with OP weapons who don't deserve to get better against hard working players is simply stupid and annoying. For all the years of playing this game it was going downhill since the PAID only to enjoy the game was added to this game. If the developers won't change things soon.. every1 who isn't a paid user is best to just leave the game in my opinion. I know this is a harsh criticism and people think you just need skill which I agree on and have skill but for all the paid weapons that are added it is just a terrible game in my opinion and I'd rather play CSGO if I was able to buy it which I'm not and have a bad PC as well. To every1 who isn't okay for pay to win or to enjoy the game or isn't good at shooting games I'd strickly advise not to play this game for it is mostly played by paid users everywhere and to get good weapons you might need years before you get 1. Best weapon currently in the game is Aug Guardian and rune blade. For those who enjoy sweating and paying for fun this game is the best otherwise I don't recommend it. Also btw only map you get to play 99% of the time is Dust 2. Hope any1 who still plays is able to enjoy the game because I don't anymore."

Game used to be cool in 2014-2015 after 2015 the game  slowly started dying out i remmeber when A Warhammer didnt exist you could kill an zombie only with a plasma gun like :O and zombies had 2k,3k hp now they have 15,25k hp and no gun can't stop em.....Basicly the game is dying fast now .I GG NEXON VERY GG If they just could remove some weapons id be verryhappy and put dna back to normal :()"
4546,this game is trash but if you want to feel the good old cs 1.6 days than play it you fukin negar
4547,If you want to die a million times with pay to win weapons and campers then this is the game for you. If not don't even bother trying to download it because this is not even close to what counter strike GO is like. There are many microtransaction.
4548,Best
4549,Better then u play against bots i vacced csgo
4550,"4/10
After some gameplays of 80+ hours i realized its a little bit p2w
You are killing this game
Do something for new players ffs devs..."
4551,it's... different.
4552,"The better csgo.

what csgo should have become."
4553,"This game is amazing. It has a wide variety of weapons, maps, modes, and classes. Its probably the best Counter Strike game I've ever played in my entire life! Even though this is a port of Counter Strike 1.6, Nexon did an amazing job!"
4554,"This game sucks major dongo, especially now that it's a Minecraft clone"
4555,"Fun game, not nearly as much fun as CS:GO Source, but for free, I cannot complain."
4556,Got a stroke
4557,p2w...
4558,"This game is a like you moth3r 
















It's a shit"
4559,"Don't play it, it's basically pay2win."
4560,pay2win still fun
4561,lol
4562,"i opened a daily box chose my item i wanted and it froze i cant fix it and tried uninstalling, closing an opening. i cant play now at all it forces my to choose a reward and after i choose it nothing happens and i cant play"
4563,Really good game just sucks that all the guns you have to pay for but it's free so what can you expect
4564,i regret having played 24 huors of this.
4565,I didn't like it that much. I thought it will be better
4566,"its like free csgo but worse. i like it becouse its free, any other way its shit xD"
4567,Pretty fun to play with friends if u have them lul
4568,:/
4569,bad
4570,"This was the second game I played on this steam account, I started it for the first time in April 2017 when the game was at its peak, one of the best games of my childhood if not the best, unfortunately the game is already dead, the zombies it even leaves the title, all that remains are precious memories.
I'm giving a positive review to everything he conceived of me for joy, if not for that I would give a negative, he is currently not worth it."
4571,"Great game, the new addition of studio mode will let me create the ultimate reference map! It'll have a bit of everything!"
4572,best
4573,"Dead!
Full of warhammer macro users..so I'm gonna use too"
4574,the game is ok but the new update is.... SO F*$*%($ AWESOME!
4575,"This game was kinda fun for the first 7 hours I played. I began decoding stuff for new weapons and then I couldn't enter a game mode without the game crashing. I then uninstalled for a while and reinstalled it, hoping maybe it was a one time thing, I even verifyed the files with steam and everything was ok but it would still crash when I tried to enter in a match. I would not recommend this game to anyone. It is broken and completely P2W, save your time."
4576,Good
4577,nice Reviewed by a potato
4578,"Counter Strike 1.6 but with chicks and zombies. However, this game is pay 2 win hell. It is also very laggy and whenever you try to exit the game, it tries to charm you with ‚Äúfree‚Äù prizes in order for you to keep playing.
But if you want to play CS 1.6 but you‚Äôre broke af, then go get some money and buy CS 1.6 instead of downloading this abomination.  Seriously, DO NOT download this game. 

P.S.: It‚Äôs funny how the zombie escape mod in CSGO is 100 times better than the one in this game."
4579,this is good game
4580,Gave me AIDS
4581,love it <3
4582,no... i dont want to go back to 1.6
4583,This game is kinda shit
4584,"CS:NZ 
Don't really know what to say?
A really bad version of 1.6.
1.6 Is better then this trash."
4585,its a good game
4586,"    I think this game is okay, compared to other games of its type. I think its a fun time waster when you dont have anything to do, I also think it gives the poor a way to play a Counter Strike game THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS AND FEELS like a official CS. I dont play games to taunt or critizise them, I play just to play. Even though I am a F2P player in a few other games, I dont have any shame. So what if it begins to be as bad as TF2? I dont even notice, since I play just to play. This game is fun when you WANT it to be. Though I will say that it isnt as good as Combat Arms, with its own gameplay."
4587,"I can say i just played maybe 200 hours and got some good stuff without paying. and dont listen to negative suggestion couse first they think they have to pay to get some good stuff.
you can get almost everything without paying maybe you need to pay for like 4 or 6 weapons or cosmetics from like 60 which you can get free you just need to play this game for a while to get a hang of it there are cool events where you can get cool stuff and etc.
hop this help you :)"
4588,i download it but the screen when is full charged to play the screenis the image of load please help
4589,Its fun to play but it has its downsides by being P2W
4590,PERFECT GAME 22/10.
4591,"good game, just lack the player base"
4592,nice game but pay2win...
4593,"Has a good menu system. The first time I played it, I had about 10fps but I restarted and now I have my beautiful 60fps! I'm utter shite at this game but it still can be fun!"
4594,this game is fore people who doesn't have money for csgo they can play this good game
4595,Asian Counter Strike
4596,Nice game Valve
4597,NoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoN

4627,doesnt load
4628,"The game is basically fun but you'll end up playing against bots and maybe 1 or 2 players on just two levels, DE Dust2 for normal deathmatch and another one for the zombie game mode.
That's all there is sadly, but if you really REALLY like playing against bots on DE Dust2 then go for it."

just kidding  this game actually sucks now and is very pay to win"
4640,Nice gameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 10/10
4641,"They turned this game into Minecraft...




Still P2W"
4642,CS ONLINE + ZOMBIES +ANIME GIRLS + POWERFULL WEAPONS
4643,this game is dumb and u should feel bad
4644,"IT FREEEEEEEEEEEEEE?!?!?! 

but.. it a p2w"
4645,This is the greatest CS 1.6 simulator of all time
4646,"Gostava muito desse jogo ( olha as horas jogadas :) ) por√©m parei de jogar pelas merdas que fizeram nas atualiza√ß√µes, cagaram muito o jogo, sem comentarios o game estar uma grande "" BOSTA "".

Espero voltar a jogar algum dia, sem mais.."
4647,"i love this game its my favouite game of 2018
"
4648,with 75 hours on this one i am safe to say that you shouldnt play it.It is quite pay2win and if you dont have good enough equipment you will get destroyer by the high ranks that fell for the microtransactios trap
4649,This game is a lot better than others let on and certainly better than I thought. it plays pretty well and its free.
4650,"Pamatuji jak to zaƒçalo, v tu dobu hran√Ω jak nƒõco, crafting, nejednalo se o P2W, po tom roce a≈æ dvou to zmƒõnily na P2W a je≈°tƒõ smazali v≈°em √∫ƒçty, tak≈æe i ta moje investice do zbran√≠ pozdƒõji nebo √∫spƒõchy kter√©ho jsem ve h≈ôe dos√°hl k hovku .... rozhodnƒõ nedoporuƒçuji, je to jenom sraƒçka v posledn√≠ dobƒõ."
4651,This game is horrible. Nothing like counter strike and is choppy as hell.
4652,"1 Pay to win 
2. op whepons 
3. Bulls**t cammping and not switching spawns

overall better fun uninstalling the game because, i am not forking over any money for this game when i can play other better games."
4653,"Actually good game, fuck you who say pay2win i love this game very good game iknow sgs,gs.bhop.1vs1 etc very funny game time killer......I hope ill pent 10k hours :D 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
           WORTH INSTALLING! SPENDED 50$ got everything <3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               (BIG REP+++ NEXON)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------"
4654,the game is fun at the first 1 or 2 hours then it becomes repetative and boring and one thing that i desagree alot with the game format is the pay 2 win system that it has like tf2 i wont say that it is a bad game tho
4655,gg for free game
4656,no
4657,This Game is Funny to play
4658,can we get a friends list system that actually works?
4659,bad.
4660,Gostei muito do jogo porque temvarios modos.
4661,Nice game...
4662,"After 2 and a half years, i decided to stop this game once the new interface has been implemented.The loss of BlindFire can be seen, all of the game's staff sold themselves for the sake of making money. I can't endure this anymore, I deleted all my weapons (just for the sake of it lol) and regret the last 500 hours spent into the game. Good bye Nexon ! Hope you wake up."
4663,"A bad game, First of all its pay 2 win, second of all the Controls are horrible, third of all the shitty graphics looks like something that was made in 1998 when the game was made in 2014, Now you may think a person with 11 hours cant say much but i can it only has 10 minutes worth of content, All Zombie scenarios are just a repetitive version in a different map"
4664,"
ME LIKE"
4665,Seriously? The original Wolfenstein was better looking than this. Gameplay is frenetic and haphazard. Feel free to skip this one.
4666,Û†Ä°
4667,This used to be loads of fun a year or two ago. Now it's really complicated and basically a mess.
4668,"Counter Strike 1.6, but with integrated mods and free to play :p"
4669,This is complete horseshit.
4670,Broken mess.
4671,no
4672,"Was fun before they added really shitty unrealistic guns, and the pay 2 win aspect. Just buy CSGO or CS Source"
4673,".

4674,"This is not any normal counter strike. This is a more wackier version of the series. It is free so don't put your hopes up to high. But the question is ""Is it worth it"". No i'm not from buzzfeed (I wish). But the answer for that really depends on the user. If you want a more serious game try the rest of the series. However if you like some random game modes in one shooter game that's free, and want to play with friends well this is for you (maybe). It's a lot better with friends, alone can be fine but won't be as much of a thrill. I've played this with friends and can be quiet enjoyable. You and your friends can be in a chat on discord, or steam it's self and talk to each other strategy to defeat the enemy team. Or to screw around in certain servers that are kind of sandbox like. I would recommend it, but it really depends on your likes and dislikes. P.S This game can run quiet well even in a low quality pc, or laptop."
4675,GOOD IT S VERY GOOD

4691,alot of these reveiws are saying itsa  pay to win game but so far ive seen none of this i the games
4692,Im sad ive played 203.7 hours :|
4693,This may have bad graphics but it is a brilliant game! 100% recomend this!
4694,"The game was quite interesting with zombie mode, i actually had interested to this game, when I was a kid, but, when game server had changed and all profiles had deleted, that was so sad and game became a trash. 

Rip Nexon Zombies =("
4695,"Game sucks no such thing as aim,skill,etc. Only thing that matters is who saw who first. As for the zombies in pvp, ima assume they're all tanks which comes down to grouping up and hope they dont get chosen as zombie and wait until time is up. Each round ending within 3-5 mins none of it being any fun. Only do for achivements and never play the game ever again."
4696,I played for 30 minutes then accidently left it on for days. Its one of the worst games ive ever played
4697,I think CSO:NST fanmade one is better and most important content is free.. But this one is updated and support MP so thats the reason i played it.

4704,"I mean ok.... The game is fun in a sense but PLEASE stop the whole pay to win BullShit. Like at least keep it so F2P's play with eachother and Pay 2 win players play with eachother.

4725,To Be Honest For a Free Game Its Pretty Good
4726,CS very good
4727,"pretty good
9/10
"
4728,"So, im a big CS:GO fan, and when i found out about this game (2 years go), i had already fallen in love, this would be the game i'd watch the most on YT, and although i dont have a good amount of time played on STEAM, i have a good amount of time played on the original Nexon Engine :'b 40+ Hours to be more specific (Took too much space and i deleted it)

moving on, time to look at the Pros and Cons

Pros:

Its a good way for people to go back in time to when games were alot better (Less P2W than most games now) So thats a 1 Pro

This game runs perfectly on nearly any PC You may have, whether it be a Weak One or a Extremely OP PC, it wont matter, it runs perfectly, 2 Pros

>3> In general, its pretty Creative (While staying P2W in some ways) To add different kinds of weapons, thats a Pro and a Con (3 Pros, 1 Con)

We also gotta keep in mind Companies like Nexon still need Funding, as with ALL COMPANIES for nearly anything, If they dont get the funding, they cant work on good games like this, and no other company could if they didnt get any funding, which would mean, Bad Games, Bad Servers, etc

So the Pros outway the Cons in my opinion, keep in mind this is from my prespective, you may have an entirely different one once you play this game, or if you've played it, this is just my view

I recommend this game to nearly Anyone and/or Everyone i know because of how good it is!

although, RIP your wallet if your a sweaty nerd who cant just work with the normal guns (2 Cons)"
4729,"Need new updates
"
4730,"Pros:
Free

Cons:
Bad Resolution
Pay to win
Bad effects
Worse Graphics than Minecraft"
4731,garbage graphics -_-
4732,"This game is fun, but, if you try to play competively, you will need friends, chances are, the random que you get put it playing solo is terrible, get some buddys, and play, at a trading perspective, its fun, but easy to get scammed. At a Surfing perspective, its very fun."
4733,good :/ not bad
4734,good
4735,Install tf2.......... uninstall this shit
4736,"i saw better 8 bit p#rn
"
4737,MINECRAFT FUCK!
4738,very nice
4739,"I played this when I had a crap computer, Masterpiece."
4740,"I only played like 2hours of this game, why the fuck is it 402 hours?"
4741,good
4742,"pay-to-win, full of cheaters despite the awful invasive AC, boring, are there any people playing?

I recommend the game because you can remove the game without hurting your PC much

If you want waifus - play OV, if you want Counter-Strike - play Counter-Strike, but not this one"

4758,well i guess they ruin the game at all with all those p2w things but still playing it
4759,"its nice game play it
"
4760,"WAS THIS GAME MADE BY EA? :) 
I wouldn't be surprised if they made us pay in order to unlock micro transactions hahahaha"
4761,"This game is good, if you spend a bit of money every now-and-then."
4762,Wow! The zombie apocalypse never been so random
4763,k
4764,"i like this game <3
"
4765,"Best game
"
4766,noice
4767,"i can't play this game  WHY?
when i join match or studio what happens.. error....
please fix it!"
4768,hmmm   nead bether  gemplay
4769,"the pvp is pay to win bs. female skins galore and female skins have much smaller hit boxes they run faster and are much harder to see then normal characters all skins are purchasable for 9.99 usd. guns are also ptw because you get decoders from every 5 levels and sometimes daily logins which usualy give temp guns. im almost level 30(29) and all i have perm is two guns which are both complete trash...the k3 light machine gun which deals no dmg and has the accuracy and recoil of a gun made entirely of paper..honestly your better off using a shotgun fully auto to spray across map..you are more likily to hit. i also have possibly the worst pistol in the game the m950 auto pistol sporting 50 bullet clip. the bullets from this gun and its accuracy/recoil make the k3 look good. litterally at pointblank its almost impossible to headshot a still target who has your gun in their mouth and even if you do head shot it would take atleast 4-5 headshots to kill since the gun does absolutle pathetic damage...iv had bb guns as a child that would hurt more. i guess if you dont drop 7$ on a decoder you wont really have any chance to get a perm gun and honestly i would not trust the decoder it would probably give some garbage melee or temp pistol/gun the best bet is spending alot of money on each perm gun they add to the shop or wait till a decent one gets put in. all in all i love this game because it lets me play custom games on old cs 1.6 maps sadly they forgot the best map...miami the bank heist hostage map. they should also add the shield into the noral gun roster. **extra info** if you are new to this game but like cs1.6 or source and am wondering if you get all the guns from the originals then the answer is almost. the guns dont seem to hav the same patterns and feel different but they do give you all of the orginal guns and equipment of the cs games(no csgo stuff that i know of) except for the shield which is not in the game. i do not recomend this game to people looking to have a fair game in pvp and unless you pay tons of money i doubt you will have any fun playing with players who do. if you enjoy playing solo against ai in gamemodes like original,tdm,vip escort and some others then this game is great for you since its basically like other cs games and you can also use any speical guns you unlock in the normal mode with bots which does add to the game if you want to feel really overpowered while the bots use base guns."
4770,It could have been so much more.
4771,Shit game
4772,Pay2win I'm too intelligent 4 dis sheet
4773,ptw trash but I still play it OmegaLUL
4774,"This is honestly one of the most incredible games I have played! The gameplay is great and you get to slay dragons just like in minecraft.fuck wrong game bois, this game is fucking terrible now #uninstall.exe"
4775,"I like the UI and some weapon designs. It's p2w in zombie mode, but other modes are fun."
4776,hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh gud 11111/10
4777,"This game is a massive micro-transaction with a large amount of players who play to win. Making it virtually unplayable for anyone who doesn't want to pay out money to have fun on a free game. The worst part is - is that it has so much potential, but falls apart on the internal workings."
4778,"Good but it crashes when i join a game
"
4779,"this game is better then csgo
"
4780,"meh CSGO is better than this shit







i enjoyed it while it was uninstalling........."
4781,"After 2K+ hours in this game..... finally got a conclusion.

For F2P( Free To Play Users)
Positive: Deathmatch, Achievements, Original Modes, just require only skills(aim,game sense).
Negative: Zombie Mode mostly in Human side is P2W( Pay To Win), New,Good,Nice,Amazing,God,Overpowered Weapons = Real Money and many toxic players! 
If you're here for fun it's ok, because this game is free. If you're here to have the ""best weapons"" NOT RECOMMEND. 

For P2W ( Pay To Win Users)
Positive: Everything 
Negative: CSNZ is smart every 6 months they add a better weapon = RIP WALLET

So in my conclusion I would say 5/10 on this game! RIP MY $$

4782,very good game
4783,Pretty Gud game I like it :D
4784,"its so pay2win, and now there are too much op guns in the game. not that fun enymore"
4785,this game is amazing!
4786,"i like this game because it can run on my current pc aswell as its a good expierience for me personaly. if you have a group of  friends to play with then its fun but i can see how some people are discouraged by it is pay to win in some aspects however there are ways to get around this like in any game 1. you just ignore it and git gud or 2. you join the ptw train. the 2nd way is a good way to go bank rupped but oh well right? i dont really care so.... i guess its cool.

4787,"Very good game, i got confused when i started to play, but when you get the point, its gonna be a piece of cake"
4788,GOOD GAME
4789,"CSGO has really gone down hill after 1.6, I really disliked the AK-47 spray patterns this game brought. I can't believe anyone would play this at a tournament level. It is just trash.





Overall, I recommend this game"
4790,"I'd say ""Yeah I fuck with this game"" if I can simply invite my friend to my party.

If you plan to play this with your friends your better off playing a shitty browser game instead of this crap. Their system is way too many problems to deal with and the gameplay for the most part is shit. Killing Floor a old game looks better, has people playing on it, and even better. You can play with your friends"
4791,"really cool game love the zombie shelter mode
i definitley recommend this game :)"
4792,an uptate like this oh hell yess

4795,Once i started playing this game my dick increased its length by 3 inches
4796,"This game has [i]some[/i] potential, but it is all taken away by what seems to be both greediness and laziness.

The pay is a major pay to win. Everything thing seems to either be unfair or just plain unplayable. The game lacks a good UI (every menu is poorly made) and pays no attention to the wants of the player. But if you pay money, however, suddenly there are many advantages to the game. The DLCs for this game are very overpriced, and you must be insane to spend money on them at all. Overall, this game is poorly made, and very sided towards paying to win. I would not recommend this game or any of its DLCs to another player."
4797,"Hey i've been playing this for 7 accounts and i love it it is so fun challenging and my viewers on YT love it when i rage.

But yeah a good game fu 2 play. to Nexon GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG"

4803,"this would be a fun game if it didnt crash every fking 5 mins i dont know wahts up with it it use to run but know it dosnt kicks me out of games come up with error iv never seen befor and i have played ober 1k hrs on it dont know why it dosnt work any more
waste of time tbh no point in downloading."
4804,it was alright...
4805,fake ass game
4806,"when i first started playing this game i though it was going to be just pay to win, but after playing it for a while i was very mistaken because there is ways to get the goods\weapons that kill everyone in like one shot. you can get the daily bonuses, you could play thee events. no matter what you dont have to pay anything."
4807,"Most matches were spent in dead lobbies filled with bots and an occasional player here and there.
The ""Zombie"" aspect is terribly unbalanced and painfully laughable. Not only do better Mods on the actual CS exist, but i personally believe you'd have more fun pretending to play Zombies in Real Life.

This game being free is too demanding on its own, but it also hosts some pretty scummy Pay To Win aspects aswell.

This isnt an official Valve title, so we can treat it as such and pretend it doesnt exist."
4808,its alright. it sucks that its kind of pay to win and it also sucks that noone speaks english other than the game itself.
4809,"In Past like 1-2-3 Years ago.THis game was a good one.With alot of  Modes,Weapons,Skins.
But right now this game turned into a good memory but there are players who plays.
Il just say that this game decerves a respect."
4810,Good Game
4811,"Classic counter-strike included in the game + zombies. But however the game is a pay to win if you try to play any other modes. It has some good game modes ""Gun game is especially fun"". Give it a try but keep in mind that it's an asian game so it's bound to be weird at times."
4812,Counter Strike: Minecraft Zombies
4813,"Before It was c.s 1.6 but zombie mode only...now it's minecraft


I recomend this game because it was fun before the studio update."

4816,terrible game
4817,"Minecraft and Csgo, plus zombies"
4818,"- if you love zombies , counter strike , action , fun time 
this is your game !"
4819,"Game is basically CS 1.6 but with zombies. I would like to say it's good but it's really not. MM (match making) takes way to long, alot of balance issues between humans and zombies, servers are bad and cause random lag spikes. Aslo it maybe free to pay but if you want to win games you need to spend money. It is DEFINITELY a pay 2 win game. The idea of this game was good however, the end result was a mediocre game at best. Overall it is a disgrace to the Counter Strike franchise and Counter Strike fans."
4820,its good if you dont have money.
4821,sooooooooo shit
4822,"Nice CS,modded,funny,zombies,everything u want!"

"
4851,Yes recommend
4852,Garbage.
4853,"this game sure has changed alot since oh.. a couple years ago...

not for the better, it seems.."
4854,CSNZ is a mod of a mod of a mod. The graphics aren't good and this game was probably built using the Gold Source engine. It's main feature is Zombies but I mainily played it on the main competitive. I think choosing which CT or T you play as is cool until you think about why The leet crew would be in america. When I started playing Cs:go I subconcienly knew all the maps which was really awesome. You should download this game if you want to play counter-strike but don't want to spend money or you don't know what the game is going to be like. Also the people aren't nearly as toxic as CSGO
4855,This game has nothing to do with the original counterstrike except for the fact that both games do have weapons...
4856,no
4857,New Update kinda ruined it :/
4858,good minecraft game
4859,My dad beats me
4860,"Too. Many. Micro-transactions.

This game needs to be fixed.

Such a good idea seems to be wasted, just look at all this stuff that you have to pay for."

4863,not bad for a free shooter
4864,"Was good, finding myself uninstalling it because 
1.kinda pay to win, with all those special arsenal

But all in all pretty good."
4865,"Jogo Muito Bom com diversos modos cl√°ssicos e novos do Counter - Strike 1.6, uma das √∫nicas desvantagens s√£o algumas skins que n√£o podem ser indentificadas como sendo TR ou CT dificultando a saber se o player √© inimigo ou aliado. Fora isso o jogo √© sensacional ! e totalmente  FREEEEE!"
4866,eh...

4877,its fun but there is a bug that keeps throwing me of the game im playing
4878,Its pay to win so its bad.
4879,i love this game just need updated graphoc but the game play was fun i would nominate this game

4883,p2w bullsh*t
4884,"Some of the multiplayer modes are fun to play thanks to the huge selection of maps,but the Zombies Mode (aka the mode that is constantly updated and most advertised) is a huge grindfest."
4885,!!!
4886,I like it.
4887,the best :3
4888,"Its a fun game solo , but with friends its a game where you can play for hundreds of hours and not get bored üòé"
4889,Good game.
4890,ITS CS WITH ZOMBIES OMG WHO WOUDNT LOVE THIS?? THIS IS BETTER THAN HL3!!

4892,Top game
4893,"This game has been a energy to my childhood since 2015 - 2016 up to this day I'm still playing.
But the developers forgot the fact about old CSNZ and became this CSNS that I don't like very much. This game used to be about collecting the sets and other stuff now If you have the top day Decoder weapon and the VIP pass you have the best weapons in the game IMO."
4894,Unexplainably laggy/buggy launcher.

My viewpoint of the game:

I spent $3k+ total ever since the game came out (2014), had all the guns and I regret it. I highly recommend all of you guys and whales to stop spending on this garbage unbalanced game. I think the only things great in this game now is zombie scenario, fun mode, all-star, playroom, studio (unreleased for CSNZ) and the new zombie bot mode (unreleased for CSNZ). The rest is PvP cancer p2w. The interface of the game sucks now because Nexon EU is forced to follow Nexon Korea's update table and they didn't realize this is a international community of players not one region. The result of this update decreased the player count and rip NA players.

TL;DR I was a whale. Now is the time to get out of Nexon's endless cycle of OP Lunar New Year, Trancendence buff, +6 premium enhance weapons, and premium zombie skins/characters. Stop feeding to Donxon. Also, studio mode is probably this game's last chance of survival.

4959,"some people will just say its a p2w game but ive not spent a dime and LOVE this game, since its free and has a zombie mode unlike many others, its a classic, with the feel of 1.6.

another thing is that the community has gotten smaller over time, but what can you say, its free and a good game for slower PC's, i doubt that other fps games that are part of a triple A seires and is free, would be as good.

so i think its great and getting the game is good to expand the community because as it said, its getting smaller.

9.8/10 amazing

 also if your on windows ten, (well atleast for me) you'll experiance some minor lag and audio can cut out sometimes, and again my friends that have the game dont have this so it could be my PC config"

4967,The game is really old. Basicly you have a team and you need to kill zombies. I think you can be he zombie. A giant one. But the game is so old that you play in pixels xD. I didn't really enjoyed it and it's a bit waste of time. I wouldn't really recommwnd this one.

4971,I have played cs since it's dawn. I took a many year hiatus and I'd Just like to say thanks for keeping a childhood memory alive. Also I suck at this game now To hell with you kids and your goadamn lightning reflexes!
4972,"I think the best way to think of this game, is CS 1.6 but with a lot of mods.

At the time of making this I've spent 50 hours on the game, I think its honestly worth a try if you're a fan of 1.6. The guns are creative, the maps look amazing and really do show what you can still do with the gold source engine, and there still updating it! While the microtransactions seem scummy at first, there really no different to what valve has impleremented and even with that nexon are much nicer with giving out items then valve, being on at european peak time has given me free decodoers (the equiv of keys and case's in this game) and from what I've seen my best guns have come from the free decoders I get. Another thing I noted, at first it seems like the game is dying but the playerbase has really always been this size, they've fixed it so you won't get so many empty servers now. 

I'd personally wish they'd add crafting back in the game, it just made the whole experince much quicker and that I could actully trade the items I have in the game, but I'm preety sure thats issue's from the main release of the game ""Counter strike online"" in asia. 

tldr: try it if you wanna see some fancy guns in CS 1.6."

5006,"Very good and fun game. You don't have to have a strong computer or laptop. It has various guns and and skins for them and players. It is a mix of action and horror and that is why I like it. Only thing i dont like is that it is more and more becoming a  pay to win. 

I would recommend everyone to download it and play it. I bet u would like it."
5007,The thing I found to be fun is to uninstall this game.
5008,Nexon is god!!!!!!!!
5009,"THis review is for the newest patch which came out today, 10/11/2017. The patch changed it to where you can no longer (at least I have not found a way) go to whichever region you want, either europe, NA or russia for instance, this is an inconvenience to me because when I am available to play NA is dead, so I used to go on the Europe servers. On top of that there is seemingly no games open for zombie hero or anything of the sort (I'm not sure if i'm in a NA lobby or if they are all grouped together), probably because nobody else is happy about this update or it could just be bad timing. The matching system is slow and often can't find a match. The old UI worked just fine we didn't need you guys to go screwing with crap. Also we can no longer make Zombie games (not zombie hero, but zombie) in friendly fire. Also when I started playing again (after about a year break) they had a lot of new guns which interested me, however it was absolutely PAY to play. Used to you had a chance at getting good weapons by using crafting recipes (not sure when they removed that) which was good because it gave the game something more to it, you could try to get blueprints and durables to get good weapons and not have to pay; however, now it is completely pay to play.

In my opinion CSNZ is tanking (and has been recently), don't spend all your money guys they're just trying to milk this out for as long as possible instead of trying to figure out what the PLAYERS want.
 So until they fix this new piece of crap UI, I'm out. It's a shame too because the Python Desperado looked interesting.

But wait theres a plus, we can now test out weapons, good job Nexon, you did one thing right.

P.S. Going to be selling my account, message me if interested."

5025,Very Good
5026,"A lot of P2W aspects unless you stick with Original/Basic mode. NA server is barely ever populated, and when it is most people have 100-400 ping. Euro server is almost always populated, you have better chance of getting a game with everyone at a decent ping.

Game is going to be dead soon, regularly peaks at around 2k while 1.6 peaks at 15k+. Play the real thing for the full, unregulated CS experience. This game is just a money sink for Nexon.

With that said, it can still be a decent CS experience if you can look past the many flaws it has.

Edit: They changed the servers and added one universal channel. You can use a matchmaing feature, but most people use the custom games tab for the old room list. I'm not sure if it's still connecting to Nexon servers or P2P.

Edit 2: The new matchmaking still uses Nexon servers, but uses the host's closest Nexon server."

[list]
[*] It's unbalanced, when the transdence weapons come to the game (transdence or buff weapons are so op) and everyone have at least one, and it's so unfear to the new players or beginer zombies.
[*] Bad events. I mean not too bad, but if a new great challange come with the event, a piece of shit challange come with it too. Yeah two or more challenges in one event.
[*] This game has not a big community but most of them are  9 years old, pervert, dickheads. 
[*] If an update come, a new problem come with it. I mean some players have crashes, higher ping or some forgottable bug come with the update. 
[*] Pay to win system and take a lot of time to upgrade a zombie (but i heard they gonne rework that).
[*] And it has a lot of issues what i didn't talk about (blocking ext.) but theese are the worst.
[/list]

And some personal, i have 35 ping or 55 but after the update i have 65 minimum, 70 most and 200 max and it's very irritataing, i don't know why it changed. I didn't notice it in other games. 
Luckily i didn't pay much, to that crap. I mean some dudes pay 300$ to this game to buy decoders and they quit the game. What a waste of money. 

So yes don't waste your time with this. But if you really, really, really wan't to play, go ahead but get ready to toxic players, ping or fps drops, magnum dildos and rages. Or the easy way is you get some ca$h and buy some decoders. This is how this game works. But i say, it's just didn't worth it."
5071,"i change my mind this is p2p you will not be able to kill any zombies without op weapons unless you pay up or waste more time doing events.
zombie scenario game-mode cant be won unless you have a FULL cooperative team  to fight off infinity waves of spawning zombies until you complete an objective and the boss has like a million HP  taking hours before you can kill him only to show his final form
zombie players have alot of HP and speed requiring team work to do anything
while some human players can instantly rekt any zombie with OP weapons"

If you've ever watched M3RKMUS1C and seen him play CoD: Online, then this game is like that, but with more zombies, and absolutly free.

Here are some things I love about this game:

{=} 1.6 Graphics are awesome
{=} A lot of gamemodes to choose from
{=} There is always people playing at any time of the day (Or night)
{=} It's free
{=} You can play original 1.6 on here
{=} ""Pay to Win"" weapons are temporary

All in all, this game is great. Now, I won't ignore some downfalls of the game, such as the crappy party system, but if you can look past that, like I did, then you're gonna have a great time."

then fear not conter strike  nexon zombies is for you!

this game was made in 2014. not many people know this game. plus its free to play. fanbase is dying.. slowly but its still fun with bots. basicaly your a survivor and you hide or camp, i suppose becasue everybody is doing that. and if a zombie kils you then your a zombie and you hunt for the survivors! the only negitive is that its a pay to win and its using a 17 year old engine which i dont mind.

5117,"I spent over 250+ hours so i can say i can give a fair review,so let's start.

Pros:
It's free version of 1.6
Bonus mods
Less cheaters
Skill Based

Cons:
Some weapons are way too overpowered,and are only obtainable with real money
Crafting system is shitty,will probably take ages to craft permanent item
They removed decoder system,which you were able to get premium items

Would i recommend this game?
Yeah,game is fine overall,it's free version of 1.6 with bonus maps,weapons,mods etc.Don't hate on it because it's free version of 1.6,it's fun with friend.Pick it up if you don't have CS:GO.

Edit: CS:GO is free, game turned into minecraft creative mode? Used to be better back in the day, but it's fun to hop into nostalgia, at least soccer is fun.

Edit 2: Decoders are back, you might have gotten hands on some old powerful weapons but they are nothing compared to new ones, if you're playing casually and going for standard weapons you're safe otherwise you're going to be destroyed by people with new OP weapons. Playerbase is low unfortunately so i'd stick with cs:go."

5146,"[h1] About Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies [/h1]
CSN:Z is not a bad game, in fact some time ago i think it was great in its own way. The weapons were actually somewhat balanced and it was more about skill than how lucky you got with your crafting or decoders. But now, things have changed. So many new weapons were introduced, and a lot of of them are just BETTER than the older ones, for example THANATOS, Magnum Drill ect., these weapons are just overpowered. Now in Zombie Scenario it will take you 30+ minutes to kill a boss with more older weapons, but with the new ones it will take you a max of 10 minutes. I wish Nexon thought about the balance of their game more, and fixed all of this, because right now, i'm not at the top of the scoreboard in Zombie Hero because i just get rekt by all these M4A1 Dark Knights, AK-47 Paladins, Magnum Drill which kill me with one mag, even though i have 10k+ health. Before i used to be in Zombie PVP HQ once, which is basically the highest league of zombie pvp players. Try the game if you want, it still has some gamemodes which aren't broken because of the new weapons. A lot of people claim its pay2win, i would have definetly disagreed before, but now it's kinda getting to that point.

[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]
Also I learned a lesson in this game, the gun power doesn't solve anything, what solves is skill. Even if the player has the most powerful weapons which will give him more damage, lower recoil and no spray control whatsoever, the skill solves everything. Things I learned from CS 1.6, they gave me an edge. It is also trully sad to see player only camp or spray'n'pray. I'll be genuine right now and say some of them wouldn't even last a map in cs 1.6. Like seriously, I had my crafted weapons which made it much more easier, but I didn't feel any satisfaction for just humiliating them. You can use even classic guns from 1.6, and you still have a chance against them. Yes, I know, these weapons are for zombie modes and etc, so why are they in original/classic modes?

5164,ITS A NICE GAME
5165,What is this scit! Zombie are immortals and oneshot you. Horrible
5166,"surprisingly a good game

5170,I watched Anomaly's video about this game. Then I saw the guy that got VAC banned and played this game for 200 hours. Now I got VAC banned too. Enjoying my VACation so far
5171,Very good modded version 1.6 free :)
5172,if you like zombie shooting this is for you
5173,this game is awesome. ive been playing since like when it came out and i still love it. the only down side is the graphics there not the very best but if your gonna be picky about it go pay 16$ for counter strike global offensive.

5183,Best game i've ever played. Guys buy all the DLC's it will make the gameplay even better.
5184,"That game was very good game. when ak47 paladin and m4a1 dark knight out game started to go dead end. I think they can't do much anymore after this time. Im remembering when i was saw the 30 days dual infinity on daily rewards. i was so happy. If this game doesn't wanna die they must to set   time/new update(no overpowered updates like magnum drill, paladin/dark knight)  settings.

I wanna know this game won't die on somedays.

edit after 1.5 years :

Game has deleted accounts 2 times. First cso Turkey. and that's you know its second time. Im looking to game there are a little players. Servers are empty. I don't think so nexon will bring back old players."
5185,sucks
5186,"Every weapon in this game is horrible unless you buy special weapons that cost an ass ton of money. This p2w garbage has the worst pvp ever, getting spawnkilled over and over, getting one tapped because you dont have the best guns, having to shoot your lmg at one monster for five minutes straight is all this game has to offer. And the hitboxes in this game are the most unpredictable things ever. If you have played other cs games this game will not meet your expectations, oh and lets not forget the crappy servers. Unrealistic movement, as well as endless amounts of bugs and glitches on maps that for some reason still do not get patched. Even if you dont mind these things, the amount of repetition no matter what map you play never stops. Dont waste your time on this p2w garbage."

5202,"I tried giving this game a chance, I really did but to this game is just horrible. Well first things first Is this Pay 2 Win?  At the same time Yes and No. You can get decoders by playing and leveling up, but your gona need to  have good luck for them to give you anything good. Another thing about PvP you can get good games, and bad games but mostly you will get pay 2 win people, that buy drills and 1 shot zombies and then think they are really good just cause they have better guns than everybody else. I really can't recomend playing this game but at the start with low rank its actualy pretty fun but, it just gets annoying after a while of playing. Soo if you really want try this out go ahead.

5212,Cs 1.6 with zombies :P
5213,i swear this game fucken weird bro it's like p2w knock off of zombie from call of duty what haha i love it i wish i would play more
5214,It was better when it was downloading
5215,Not Bad
5216,BEST GAME  ON STEAM THAT I EVERE PLAYED
5217,"When i first played the game, it was super nice...
But now, IT'S PAY TO WIN
i mean seriously, in early 2016 and 2015 you had to be lucky to get a good weapon from crafting(removed now). Which now does not even makes sense.

Now you need to buy decoders and to be lucky and get a op weapon
What i mean in OP weapon, well, when someone has a Magnum Drill he just activates the headshot skill and you instantly die as a zombie, same thing with the Warhammer, and there are many more OP weapons
And if you are a player that never paid for this game, or a starter, you are just not having fun with the game, it's super annoying and bad

Now bugs: Many gamebreaking bugs in maps and weapons. Some bugs in maps i know from when i started playing, they aren't solved not even now. (estate, assault)

Female characters: Bad decision, in team deathmatch, deathmatch, etc.
The characters are very thin and it's hard to shoot and kill them, and they get an advantage over a normal character

In zombie giant Game mode, same thing, you die very fast as a giant zombie(op weapons), and when someone comes with a melee to you as a zombie, it take like half of your health and it's super annoying.

There is a few game modes which deserve to be played like Zombie escape, Zombie shelter, All star, Bot zombie and Original, which is pretty much Cs 1.6

Overall, the game is bad, if you think to start playing it better don't, unless you decide to pay around 100$ and be an OP player

EDIT: This is not the games fault, but there is turkey people that are coming to europe and america and just talk in their launguace, which is quite annoying while rude at the same time, they kinda should do something about that"
5218,I lover counter strike and this game but could you make it run on lower cpu like hife life 2
5219,"Played the game for quite a few years its well...not a bad game but also not a really good one. All they kinda did was take counter strike and throw in zombies...so a mod of a mod.

Some upsides is it is quite fun to play as a zombie and the more you play as one the stronger your skills get with one. Dose have quite a few game modes and even has all of the original for free.

Some....or menny downsides is that it is heavy and I mean HEAVY pay to win. Like I pointed out before the zombie part is free to play but to do well or anything as a human you need good guns. The other large drawback is they always keep pumping out more new better guns each week so you kinda have to keep spending to get more guns and up to date guns. The other downside about it is its not like you buy the gun no you buy a decoder and use it to have a CHANCE to get a good gun and even so there is also another chance it can not be permanent. To get a weapon to be permanent you have to go 1000 days...I feel it should maybe be less then that like 500. 

Other major downside is that the players you play with are quite well...toxic so doing scenario for the first time or doing Zombie escape at all tends have players that give you a hard time or easily solo it without knowing what way to go. On Zombie escape you get the high level players knowing all the bugs and tips on the map to get ahead and then use flash bomb to make the new players have an even harder time.

So with my experience I only stayed with Zombie hero mode. But even with that there was still some bugs hackers trash talkers and finally pay to win players able to dominate and solo an entire hord of Zombies. Seen quite a few people using big bug exploits to get out of the map all the time but the report never really works and the vote kick is broken and never works.

Some last points to go over is sound and graphics and well yah it is old and not that great it is alright....for a game from about 20 years from now but to have it now is quite weak and stale. So seeing how this game was released only a few years ago I feel they should have done something far more better.

What finally made me decide to stop playing is that I got a better computer, better games, and finally when I felt like going back to play this for nostalgia reasons they slapped me with an auto click/macro ban. So no warning just one day I got on and was banned. I sent a request ticket to see what happened  with my account and it took 3 months for them to finally figure out what it was. So yah if you are going to also think about sending a support ticket for something it will take a long time. I do have to thank that they got to the bottom of what happened but sadly I guess that is it so if I had to rate this game I would do 2 to 3 stars out of 10 with all that has happened to me. I look at the ban as more of something to have me move on and just remember the good old times because with the way this game is going I don't think it is going to get good any time soon."
5220,"IT MESSES UP ALOT

5221,Stay away from this garbage and play no more room in hell instead.
5222,This game let me play a week ago. NOW I CANT EVEN LAUNCH IT i didn't download anything... well.. maybe a mod to dying light BUT THAT IS NOT RELATED TO CSNZ!! this game is shit now fucking uninstalled
5223,as free game it worths it
5224,"As 21 Savage would say ""issa great game"""
5225,"this game i can describe as, Combat Arms. Done SLIGHTLY better.
if there was a mixed opinion option, this game would have that

If you compare this game to counter strike online, you'd be better off playing counter strike online."
5226,"Require all your ammo to kill a single zombie. Bad graphics. Lazy art. Windowed mode. menu is awful.

Overall I was a happier person before I owned this product."
5227,just get counter strike

5231,its a good game
5232,I was gonna come back to play it but now I remember that all the good weapons that I had were limited and now I probably got nothing
5233,"It's a fun version of counter strike and to be honest it isn't that bad. However, if you are expecting to have a good gameplay don't have high expectations, as it is kind of glitchy."
5234,"P2W game. Nexon's staff is fascinated to create a wall between users (Trump's syndrome), separating them from regular and ""VIP"". Also, if you have a problem with the game, Nexon's staff will not even appear.
If you have money, this is your game! Since if you pay a good amount, you will be unbelievable! It does not matter if you use hacks, bugs, teaming with the enemy, whatever. The Nexon's staff will not do anything against you! ;)"

2.Be poor, with no money but in the same time a PRO, enjoying the game with your friends, trolling the retard people who spend huge amouth of money each day just to fill the loneliness from their brains and souls..."

5252,"So, I will forever love CS1.3-CS1.6, but the character skins and forged guns in Zombies are whack!  I guess its for the zombies, but the dragon shotgun modification is so lame on TDM.  Also, all the female skins decrease the hitbox, for me, it seems.  Not a super fan of skinny targets on an ole fps like CS.  

Bring back WC3 Mod, if you really luv us like we luv you. <3

A few seconds later I spawn as a zombie with special abilites and the whole map is getting fucked around by huge robots and stuff like that. 

Fun= 8/10
No Bugs= 9/10
HP system= 2/10

5256,great alternative to CSGO. would definitely play to my heart's content

5261,Nope.

5263,"I do not reccomend getting this game, I would only get this game if you are waiting to purchase CS:GO although TF2 Would be 4000% fucking better.

Community: 1/10 There is a community?"
5264,"CS nexon zombies is the best game ever, fuck everyone who left a negative review, it's like tons of games combined, it's got weapons crafting like tf2, it's pay to win like every iOS game ever, boobs and butts look like they do in Tomb raider 1996, the game has FIFA 2k17 but you can kill the other players, steal the ball, then go score before they respawn, there's rocket launcher battles, and fucking perk battles, it's like half life 1 but the zombies don't do shit to you because you have like 10,000 hp, and they also die in one hit so you can do the whole level with only your knife. Plus the characters narrating the story or whatever are anime so that just another fucking plus. 10/10 better than CS:GO"

Every weapon thats good you have to pay for, even if youre good at cs, this hunking pile of garbage breaks the very dimensions of what cs stood for. and thats skill.

I would never reccomend this game to a person looking for a fun free cs game"

5294,"I would not recommend this game. Take everything you know from the other Counter-Strike games, and throw it out of the window. The weapons are terrible and the only good ones you have to pay for. The starter weapons are impossible to use. They don't hit anything, even when standing still or running. The PvE modes have virtually unkillable bosses that require 5 minutes of 4 people firing their LMGs into a monster. You want to preform well in PvE without spending money? Too bad. The P2P people's weapons are always better and do more damage. Please don't get this game. I wasted 16 hours of my life on this game that I can't get back. But this game can run on a potato. That's pretty much it's only pro."

5305,"A great game for those who like CS 1.6. Would i recommend it?  Of course yes. It plays like 1.6 , looks like 1.6. It has small problems that are not really big of a deal. To people that say this game is P2W. It is not. The game has daily rewards , zombie scenario and level up rewards. You can get permament weapons from either crafting or decoders."

On a more serious note its pretty fun if you play only the zombie and fun modes, team deathmatch, original etc is pure shit due to overpowered weapons. 
Community is pretty bad also, especially in EU the whole game is full of Turkish players, you will have a hard time to communicate with anyone there since most of them speak their mother language

Play this game only for fun, like those days where you are tired of playing the same games again and again and just want something different, its free

Cons: The annoying PTW.

I enjoy it anyways.
It has many co-op modes and playing with OP af people is not too bad.

EDIT: This is an old review

They have ruined the game since they made a matchmaking system, all servers are super duper lagg, they removed the option to craft other weapons as i was grinding points and parts for it.

Once they put in studio mode, it became so cringy, because unlike hammer's potential, it looks like something from minecraft and very limited to make with."
5354,its not too bad once you understand the main menu layout and the horrible graphics
5355,"Words cannot describe how terrible and poorly made this game is.  It's like Valve (or whoever made this abomination) just wanted you to suffer and die a slow and painful death in the comfort of your own home.  I would really like to thank the Dev Team for finally letting me realize that I should just kill myself.  Honestly, I think that if a cat walked on a keyboard to create the code for a game, it would have been better than this pile of shit.  I hope Valve makes Left 4 Dead 3 or Team Fortress 3 (what's wrong with the number 3?!???!)."
5356,"TL;DR This game is shit 


Maybe 5 years ago, I would recommend this game to everyone. Nowadays, I'd say you stay away from this trash. The game itself is insanely Pay to Win. Money was always a part of this game, but it's gotten much much worse, to the point that anyone with a better weapon than you will make you want to quit instantly. The prices are ridiculous, free to play players aren't very welcome by nexon and what you get isn't going to be good for a long time. They keep updating the game with new overpowered weapons every so often, which makes the previous one obsolete (for which you could have paid an insane amount of money for). 

While this game is free to play, it feels like you're playing a demo at this point. This isn't helped by any of the bugs and exploits people use to cheat the system. Most notably, currency exploits that allow you to get discounts on shop items (Cheaper currency = cheaper items). While this is against steam rules, 90% of p2w players abuse this bug. 

One might say that the game is like CS 1.6 but with a lot of mods, which is true, but only about 10% of them are being played regularly. 80% of the weapons are obsolete, rendering them useless for the past 4 or so years, and in all the present gamemodes only a few of them are being played regularly. 

Speaking of which, there are about 3 main gamemodes people play. Zombie hero, a PVP based mode in which you have a team of zombies whose goal is to infect the humans to win, and the humans must survive to win. This is the meat of CSNS, and if you don't like it, then might as well leave. It's somewhat frustrating to play as the zombies, because the humans camp and shoot at you, making you unable to move, or run around shooting at you, and you can't catch up to them. Almost as if when you've been infected, you lost and you get punished for it. As the humans, you don't even stand a chance if you don't have P2W weapons (and you won't unless you pay a crap ton) so once again you miss out. 

There is also Zombie scenario, which is kind of shit. The zombie AI sucks and the zombies reach you from very far. The lore is google translated and frankly no one gives a shit. Go play L4D2 or cod zombies if you're looking for a zombie bot game.

Finally there's original. The classic CT vs T gamemode where you PVP human vs human. It's alright, as long as the host sets a restriction on ""classic"" weapons, which will provide an almost identical experience to what you might see in CS 1.6. If you're looking for a free version of CS1.6, this is it, except there aren't many players. So just go get 1.6

So the gamemodes suck, the game is p2w, and it sounds like there's nothing to do right? Yes.

If you're still not convinced, here's a rapid fire of some problems you might encounter!
- constant DDOS attacks (Nexon doesn't care)
- Confusing menu, and game mechanics
- Google translated text
- non-existent Support
- corrupt Game moderators
- censorship on forums and unjustified bans
- non-justified game bans 
- Loud anime voices and bad sound
- BUGS
- Bad in-game quests for pointless rewards
- Overall not a CS experience"
5357,full of shit i wanna kill myself
5358,At first look the game looks promising.. then the real hell begins. It basically P2W (pay to win).
5359,"It has very good menu and stuff but the actual gameplay is bad. Like is zombie escape: I go to the elevator, i walk in but then the barrier pops up early so i can't get in, and i become a zombie. Bad"
5360,sdgfsdf
5361,Na cacat
5362,"I used to love this game but from what i've played recently i have to say that the game went to shit. they used to have a pretty damn good crafting system that allowed to craft every weapon in the game it took some farming to do and usually the result was a decent gun for a 90 day period you could off course extend it using special tickets (i have +1k of them) and once this period makes about a year the gun becomes pernamet now the only way of getting guns is through decoders (loot boxes) most of which you can pay for (prices are retarded) or get via event's, oh and they fucked the balance/meta HARD. from the plus side the game got new guns maps and modes but i don't think it was worth it."
5363,No Vac enabled? sweet ill cheat
5364,csgo 2
5365,not verry good quite loud not a verry got cs game and the 71 euros worth of dlc i dont think it makes the game any better
5366,"Literally best game
Bought all DLC
Full Price
I play zombies everyday
Only good gamemode"
5367,"I knocked a friend out in a soccer 1v1.

10/10"
5368,"It said ""Counter Strike"" and had zombies in it, why else would I have installed this when I was 13?"
5369,The most satisfying thing of this game is uninstalling it.
5370,"Well, as much as I would like to bash on the game because of the overpriced micro-transactions, I really can't. People say this game has gotten more and more p2w, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. Back when decoders where initially released, the rates for the best items (unique grades being the best at the time, with transcendence being highest right now) from mileage decoders where insanely low, next to impossible to get even. Now, the game not only gives you free transcendence, rare, event and unique decoders for free, but the items they offer are MUCH better, transcendence and event decoders having the 2nd best melee in the game, dual sword phantom slayer, but ALSO the rates are astonishingly better for even transcendence grade items. Plus, people make a huge deal out of the p2w thing, saying stuff like ""ohhhhh you can't play this game if you don't spend money"" and ""only whales should play this game because f2p can't even fight back!!!!!"" completely false. I even started a new account to test my theory out, and I was correct. You are able to get some VERY good weapons from all the free decoders you get from events, that allow you to compete with a majority of the player base. The reason why people make a big deal out of the whole p2w thing is (I believe) that there are a few weapons, epic grade (highest grade and most powerful), which are unobtainable for f2p players. Only way for a f2p to get these weapons are from logging in 25 days in a row, in which case you get a epic grade weapon for 5 DAYS ONLY, and the free VVIP pass that lasts for 1 day (but gives every epic tier weapon). Of course, the only way to get the epic grade weapons permanently, is to open epic decoders, which are sold on the shop when an event that includes a epic grade weapon is in place. Many people see this as a terrible thing (having the most powerful weapons exclusive for people who spend money) but trust me when I say it's not as bad as it sounds. If every (or most) people in a lobby had these weapons, the zombie side would never EVER be able to win a round. Even now it's very difficult if the human side has a few players with epic grades, imagine if like 15 people had all epic grades in 1 lobby, doesn't sound fun to die every 10 seconds now does it?. 

TLDR; The game is in the best state it has been since launch. And the whole ""p2w"" thing has been reduced IMMENSELY, with the only weapons not being obtainable by f2ps being some powerful weapons that would make the game completely unbalanced if everyone had them.
People over-exaggerate the state of ""p2w"" in this game, you could basically call this game f2p now. If you look at other examples of games that are completely p2w like Zula etc. , it's not even CLOSE to being as bad."
5371,It is a free p2w Counter-Strike: Condition zero.

5373,10/10 BEST GAME EVER SLAPED MY MEAT TO THE CHARACTERS SO MUCH OMG YOU HAVE NO IDEA
5374,"It is a OK game...







in 2015,now its really bad"
5375,"It's a really good game... if you're looking for a reason to find a game bad enough to make literally any other game look bareable. 

The UI is broken.
The weapons are broken (In a sense that they are unbalanaced).
Now only that, but half the time, if you just want to play with your friend who's laptop is comparable to that of hunk of a meteorite from space, you can't find a game where a Pay To Win doesn't join. (This one is actually good if you like to see your friend rage)

Above all, nothing like any of the CS games, it's not even developed or published by Valve. The most fun you'll get from this game is hiding behind boxes seeing zombies run past you like a bunch of idiots or hiding in the obligatory OP spots on Rust where no zombie will ever get you (unless you run out of ammo).  

[h1] Only get this game if you want to compare your probably better game to this. [/h1]"

5383,"Pretty nice game , but the reason this is a little shitty you have to play a lot to be a pro in this game :)"
5384,very good.
5385,"This game will only be fun when you put money in it, guess you got what you pay for lol.

Seriously though, for people who bashed this game I can understand their furstration about balance, pay2win and 3 polygon graphics. But in truth, what do you expect from a free2play game from 10 years ago anyway. I play this purely for nostalgic reason and I do admit I think this game is fun because of fuck tons of weird weapons and game modes (including campaign for both human stories and zombie stories). And yes, the only downside is if you want to do well in the game you gotta pay since it's REALLY hard to grind.

Other than that, I do enjoy the game both 10 years before and today, I guess it's only fair that to admit that quality of modern games are improving, which is why people won't enjoy an old game like this anymore XD

To conclude I'd recommend this game to anyone if they missed quake and half life 1 graphics, and experience how a classic shooter game can be modified to have so much stuffs to do.

5432,Counter-Strike/ Condition Zero with Zombies and Zombie modes. Pretty good game to be free but has a ton of bugs and needs to be better balanced. The best mode is Gun Deathmatch and I'd like more modes like it
5433,"Counter Strike Nexon Studio

It's a Counter Strike game with a very large content of models for players/guns/maps etc.
In this game we have big selection of classes human and zombie, guns from the best Gunsmiths (Henry, Gunsmith) Every detail of weapons is finished. Skull, Thanatos, Janus, Vulcanus, Dark Knight/Paladin Series. We have also classic/zombie/zombie scenario/fun/football/deathmatch/original/all star/hide n seek modes of game, and much more. We have also events when we can get things for free (decoders, classes, guns etc.)
You can level your character and got better things. 
But one defect in this game is too P2W. Game forces us to buying decoders etc. things. But considering that the game is free, so it must earn somehow.

Summarizing this game is new Counter Strike 1.6, with better models and new thing need to test for you!

My review of this game is 7/10"

5441,"I always have to exit hte game because after every match im stuck on the leaderboards, I press every button on my pc, but nothing seems to happen I do not exactly know wat im supposed to do, but now it is running with no way to shut it down or to uninstall, i reinstalled the game and it gave me the same problem, but over all, a fun game even though it was shortly played."

5443,"I played this game with my firend once, and even though i haven't played it a lot, I'm still gonna give my opinion. The game is alright, many people when they first see the game think it's like CS:GO, which it's not. For those of you who play Halo, I can sum it up like this, it's basically the flood gamemode, but with unlockable items. It's basically zombies versus soldiers, but every soldier that dies, becomes a zombie. I recommend the game if you like the flood gamemode from Halo."
5444,"helpful

5445,bad
5446,gut gut
5447,"This game is pretty decent if you want to kill some time. Lots of modes (Mostly zombie oriented) and the classic maps you loved in CS. As for the thumbs down, hear me out. What you have is a CS spin off with a zombie twist. You have MMORPG-like features, like crafting and enhancement, that set this game apart from most of the lobby-based shooters our there. To be honest, I would give a thumbs up because it's fun most of the time but here's why it's a no-go:

- When I said MMORPG-like features, it even included the heavy grind you'd expect from one. Unless you're our friendly neighborhood Wallet Warrior, you'll be spending mad hours here.
- Unless the room restricts its use, the weapons not vanilla to CS are HIGHY UNBALANCED. For example, in Zombie Hero (Which is basically PvP infection (Think Halo's infection)), there's this sword that literally one shots the alpha zombie which has well over 1000hp (I'm not even exaggerating)
- Because of the above point, it's really hard to get new players into the game without giving them a buck or two to spend for themselves. Or you could just hope that they're VERY interested.
- Bloody love this in MMO shooters, EQUIPMENT TIMERS!!! You can ""Unbox"" weapons using these things called Decoders (Most of the time you have to buy them unless they say otherwise) and they didnt even guarentee a perma weapon until recently and I dont think those decoders are here to stay.  Of course you can ""craft"" perma weapons but you need a blueprint (Which is a ""categorized"" system, each blueprint containing their own set of weapons you can pray to RNGesus for) and a DURABLE (This.... thing from hell has different types; 1-10 days, 11-20 ... 72-Perm, and YOU GUESSED IT! Has a VERY low chance of you achieving perm weapon craft. Forget the chance of success to actually make the weapon, there's even a percent chance you even touch perm duration.)

TL;DR Be ready for a hard grind and better start setting up your altar to RNGesus again."
5448,"i am verry verry happi i go HQ
 it is my dream . what you open mantence
"
5449,the game kept running even after i closed it and i only opened it once. only to discover one day on task manager that it never closed it just ran in the background. 700+ hours should give you an idea how long it ran by itself.
5450,Some words and centences are still russian even tough it's been weeks. Which is not cool. Other than that it's basically Counter Strike 1.6 with zombies. Which is cool. I mean cooler than cs 1.6 today.
5451,Era bom agora fico meio entedioso
5452,not that good but you can have some fun in it
5453,"One of the most biggest let downs in games, besides No Man's Sky! I though this would be a very fun side game to whenever I'm bored with CS:GO, however I was sadly mistaken!"
5454,"best game
"
5455,"Look i'm not saying the game is bad,NO!the game is really good,it's fun it isn't full of russians,etc (not racist) 
but this game is very cringy too,wanna know why?
-Skins
-Over 9000 HP for a normal zombie
-Too many bugs
-Campers
-You must buy everything from the shop to get atleast a decent inventory
-If you buy something,it will NOT appear in steam inventory
-Most of the players camp to get rid of zombies
-INFINITE ZOMBIES with no spawn delay
-Uhh....Anime...in CS....really? well i heard in Thailand Sex changing is pretty cheap..
-CS 1.6 made in Thailand
-Girls got male voices (sex change)
-Cringy Soundtrack
-Players die too fast
-Players don't bleed
-You get Money too easy
-It says sexy but all i see is some cheap women
-Chinese girls with german,USA,etc police men... (SEX CHANGE)
and MUCH MUCH MORE!

It's a nice little bonus for those who decided to purchase one of the special editions of Counter Strike.
It's definitely not a fully updated game, as is expected by some fans.
A real OLD-school shooter! :)

5479,"a bad idea, and a bad game.
the idea behind counter strike is terrorrist vs counter-terrirrist, but ther are no terrorrist in this game, no bomb planing, no hostage rescue, the two main modes in the real counter-strike. the exactution of the game was bad. the graphics were bad. when you shoot somebody it's slows him down too much, so the zombies can't kill somebody that camp i a place and shoot them. no elements of counter-strike (only the maps and the textures were added) have got in the game. horrible game. the only good thing in this game is that the game is free, and you can see why.

5511,"People say that this game is bad.. But in all honesty its flipping FREE, With a 1.6 style, its not like the ""spray pattern"" needs to be straight! This is a zombie game its not like csgo, wiht casual, deathmatch, competitive, this is a free csgo, that people can enjoy and i honestly dont have problems with turks or brazillians, cause there all kind, When people say this is a toxic game, i laugh Because look at csgo, every game i go into they're so Toxic its annoying! And you dont need to spend a dime on this game to get weapons unlike tf2! And csgo, and most of the time no one is toxic for the times i've been in this game, and i love to bhop in this game, i recommend this game, cause its free and simply easy to not spend a dime on unless you want to claim you're wasting your time by just buying, when you can earn, its sad i only have around an hour, but i've actually explored a lot in that 1 hour and 21 minutes i've played... And this game looks like i'll actually be able to enjoy a game like this even tho i have csgo, i actually enjoy this one just as much as Csgo :)
This is my opinion i also think people who dont recommend the game, How about you dont spend 100000 dollars in pixelated games  And if you take this seriously, stop reading this thanks and have a nice time! Enjoy an amazing game!"

Pros : 
+Different game mods
+Different types of guns ( sooooo many ) 
+Easy and simple gameplay

Cons:
-Pay to win
-90% or more people are without mic and don't talk in chat. 
-as i said its pay to win, there are guns that are OP af, you dont stand chance against them.
-For free players it takes long as hell to get good guns, most of the time in crafting you are going to get shit.
-Some of the mods doesnt make sense and are stupid and one sided."

lots of game modes to pick from
lots of maps to choose from
lots of people to play with
lots of servers to play in
this game has lots to offer, literally

cons-
graphics are quite outdated, almost feels like n64 again lol, think goldeneye64
in-game voice trans
really wish someone would add iron sights to every gun for accuracy"
5532,"I didn't enjoy this game one bit, and it's really pay to win."
5533,"To be 100%, the game with all of it's microtransaction monetization bullshit is a bit annoying. To even get a good zombies weapon, you need to go out of your way to get decoders, but the weapons don't even last forever, making you have to get an time extender (which can also be bought). Besides the transactions, the game is an excellent spin-off that doesn't divert too far from the source material, seeing as the original modes are back along with a few more fun modes. It's good to see that Counter-Strike is finally embracing the user-created material, like zombies, jump, etc. like they should've a long time ago. Overall, i think this game should be played with a fat wallet and addictive playing patterns. Still fun for the broke gamer, too."

5535,don't play this crap
5536,"Before i played this, i could swear my pants were on"
5537,"i recomend it
its like cs go and can run on weak PCs

thats what i said before i had a good pc. it was around 2017 when i first got this game. i didnt have money to buy cs 1.6 or source. and my pc was way too weak to handle CS:GO. i definetly reccomend it if your pc is weak or normal cs is just too boring for you. but now that CS:GO is free i dont see many people getting this for the price"
5538,the game is not really counter strike but definitely a good shooter judging that it is free probably my 2nd favourite free game out there just give it a try its free why not
5539,to broke to buy csgo well this is the game for you
5540,"okay so the games graphics arent the best but i can see past them. also this game doesnt closes after you quit the game correctly. It keeps running and lags your computer and hogs cpu (for me cuz my pc trash). I have ""51"" hours played even tho ive played like 14 realy hours. Just bugs me cuz the app will run for 3 days and i cant play anything else becuase its running and steam cant run 2 apps at once. 4/10"

5558,"I really can't bring myself to write an extensive review of this game. To summarise it wholely, it's P2W to the most extreme extent, with some pockets of fun.

It can be great, the Gun deathmatch mode is far superior to CSGO's Arm's Race, but apart from that, the majority of Game modes are plagued by P2W. Even Gun deathmatch is unbalanced AF. 

It's a bad game, but that's not to say it can't be fun. I tried coming back to it, but I just can't, I played a match of Gund deathmatch but couldn't bring myself to touch the other modes with a ten foot pole.  It literally exhausts me just to even think about how poor this game is.


Nexon, I'm begging you, just stop. Don't publish anymore games. You've done enough, please stop."
5559,I cannot get this game to run even when I have stream and the nexon launcher
5560,Nexon makes a mistake and makes its users pay for it :)
5561,Pure waste of time and money

5568,Its so pay to win by the fact that this is the first game i used real money into but its real fun once u get used to it
5569,Nice !! Game
5570,"This is pretty much Counter Strike 1.6 but free, including added gamemodes and weapons. It is free, so try it out and you might just fall in love with it.Some modes also have bots, which is a HUGE plus in my book, that way if the multiplayer ever dies, you can still enjoy the game. I rate it 10/10, mostly because it's free, and the gameplay is perfect. I enjoyed this alot more than CSGO. Graphics aren't anything special, but here gameplay is what matters, and since the graphics are old it makes this game easier to run on most PC's. This game is amazing, so go try it"

5582,"Eh maybe its just me, but the game looks fun before you download it, but not until you get into a game.
But I have to cut it some slack because I know its old, ( it looks like it runs on 1.6 or lower ) but honestly its not that  fun, well not for me, but those japanese people seem to like this game."
5583,"Beware, people of the West and Europe.
This game is a gahdamn asylum for Asian people.

Total madness. Total kinda-animu. Total p2w poop."
5584,Really cool free to play game. Thank for adding this game on Steam.
5585,"This game is terrible... it runs slow, the gameplay is an inane experience, almost nobody plays, and it mainly involves running around in circle trying to kill zombies with your nerf gun."
5586,"So..conter strike studio, what to say, it's been some years....if you enter for the 1st time you probably will keep ond dying left and right, actually scratch the probably......the truth his you either get crazy lucky and win a very powerfull weapon and i don't mean that ""30 days"" or ""3 days"" nah...it's either permanent or it's useless, next you need a powerfull class...thats right you have diffrent classes in this game not just your usual CT or T you even got tiers:

Grey: Easy, 
Green: A bit harder to get,
Blue: Congrats !, 
Red: Lucky but not 100% there just yet,
Gold: Ye....i want one....(also some gold's have unique voicelines) 

Also weapons have the same tier except one above being purple, those weapons literally making the user immortal in the right hand so ye....P2W much ? 

Moving on from that, zombies only need to scratch you to kill you or as i like to call it: Congrats you will now die alot of times until either you win the round somehow...or simply the time ends....but thats just scratching the surface, this game also has TDM and Deathmatch and alot other cool but sadly obsolete gamemodes, like soccer....ye....soccer....it also has hide and seek, zombie evolution etc.....

Anyways i could go on and on to describe the game but i allready said too much, so let me make one thing clear: you got money to spend, then this game will make you a god, that his if your lucky enough, then again your got a ton of money so luck his allready on your side no ?, or if your like me, you need to waste a ton of time, effort, and pacience to even get some low end trash loot and classes, but on those days where they decide to throw you a bone and give you a gold weapon that actually kills.....that his when they hook you....the feeling of superiority as you mow down a band of 10 zombie all at once, that his true bliss, to you not the other 10 players sick of dying over and over again.....


And now to really end it ( i mean it this time) its cs 1.6 but free.......i mean...ye just pop a TDM match in classic mode and boom....oldschool cs 1.6 with some upgraded graphics here and there.


I rate it 10/10 don't play it....."

5591,BRAINS!!!!!
5592,"I've gotta say, at a glance this game looks retarded due to its outdated graphics but i can assure its a score, Many unique weapons and a strong sense of nostalgia comes with this game. Many fun custom game modes to choose from."
5593,"The game has potential but it went to far with those unrealistic or sifi weapons, and too much pay to win in this game, never have those motivated feeling any more, especially in zombie mode, use to be a high presure and team work mode, now..... just chase those zombie around."
5594,"this game is really fun i like it, and its have many type of mods and game play and weapons, its will be more fun if the add TTT as will But

if you want to be the best you have to pay $$$ and the best who have all the guns $$$

and its do have that daily prizes but still not that much TBH

the community is not really that bad cuz i see them typeing some time like noobs and go ***** your self and your a ***** so yeah we all *stars* and i still can see hackers here and there but that VAC is really good and evrey one know how good it is XD

5599,"Can't launch the game
12/10"
5600,"   The game is actually really fun to play and it is free to play game. But it looks too old in my opinion even if they wanted to make it look like cs 1.6. It has a lot of purchasable items and a crafting system. You get a lot of stuff early on so you can play this game easily and don't pay any kind of money. Of course there are some really fancy weapons that need money, but they're mostly for zombie modes.
   I definetly should say that you give this game a try and maybe you will like it, its pretty fun, but too old.

"
5601,hi
5602,the game is very enjoyable
5603,This game is very good if you like fps you pick this if you want anyways this game is really good if you got a good friends playing ;}
5604,Really enjoy it and it takes away my boring time. I was originally looking for a game where you can defeat zombies and have the view of a zombie and Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies has brought my search to an end. Definitely recommend it!
5605,This game is worthless. I wouldn't even waste your downloading it. Iced.

5622,this sht keeps sayin its running when im not playin and and i cant play or uninstall
5623,It aight
5624,better than counter-strike: soarce
5625,free to play but pay to win
5626,Its a great game its fun no doubt about it a slight bit of problems with steam on the game but overall perfect theres tons of guns and constant updates adding new things to make it even better :)
5627,"If you ever played CS 1.6 And you liked it CSNZ is for you
Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is like cs 1.6 with mods = More weapons, modes, 
if trading through was added (trading weapons, decoders and stuff) i would play this game more than now"
5628,"So yeah. I had played it before (CS:O to be clear) it seems that not much of a difference has been made. In terms of gameplay, it's not perfect: usually you get very choppy / laggy gameplay experience because of the poor optimisation especially when playing zombies mod (scenario, etc.). I know that it's not new considering its old engine. However, they could have done better. Besides that, when launching the game, you don't get the fullscreen mode when being in the main menu. So if you have a high resolution on the small screen it's better to get the magnifier to be able to read a thing. Despite my criticism, I found it fun to play because there are a lot of different gamemodes that you and your friends can rock on. If you like playing zombies game, it's worth a try. 

Personally, I tried it because of the scenario mod, which hasn't changed. And if you don't really care that much about the skins / player models, you may find it interesting. However, be careful not to spend a lot of money. It's just not worth it. Better buy any other cs game than spend it here. 

Have fun."
5629,"Very well done, it even runs on my potato of a compootis!"
5630,"Don't even look at this store page, leave now, it's trash, I would actually play Classic CS (which is what it's running on) over this. Move on with your life."

5633,0/10 cant bunnyhop and zombies r too spooky
5634,"Not bad, love my zombie games but probably wouldn't recommend this. Not as good as I thought I'd be, I would still play this but not as much."
5635,Its a good game  if you like survival games. And its bassiclly free cs 1.6 but its anime
5636,"GREAT for dicking around and not being serious. But if you try to play this seriously or competitively then fun goes out the window. Game balance is quite broken, heavily Pay To Win, and impossible for new players.

But fighting against Bots, or none PVP games like survival, Speed/DeathRun, and PVE is fun.

Old Review ^^^

Currently the devs sold out and the game can hardly even be called a game at all. I'm not even sure how to describe it at all honestly, but I know you can spend hundreds of dollars on it."
5637,sakaifoa
5638,"its free to play counter strike way not  theres classic mode and zombies you can play with bots
"
5639,Creepy
5640,"I had an older review in this one's place, but I noticed it was outdated in a lot of ways. That being said, I decided to re-write it in order to give some tips on how to counteract the P2W nature the game sadly embraced.

The way I earned a number of weapons (and how I put up with the game for this long) requires you to put in minimal effort every day for a longer period of time. If you don't feel like doing that, feel free to skip this.

The easiest thing you can do to earn things is simply playing 10 minutes every day, be it with friends, random people online or just bots. This allows you to claim the daily rewards - which are often more useful than you might suspect. From what I noticed, they are almost always either season pass coins or parts weapons boxes. 

If the daily reward is the weapons box, after getting them and opening them from the inventory, you get the choice of around 8 permanent weapons. You can either choose any that you like, or turn them into profits. See, any permanent weapon can be dissassembled in the craft menu, which gives you 500 Mileage and 100 extension coupons for every weapon dissassembled. If you get 1000 extension coupons, you can turn any trial weapon into a permanent one and get another 500 Mileage out of that (assuming the weapon supports extending). 

In the case of coins - just collect them every day and claim the weapons from the free season pass. These weapons tend to be more valuable than normal weapons because of their rarity. This is important, and also where the ""little effort daily for a longer period"" catch comes into play. 

I am, of course, reffering to the mileage auction (in short, a player auction with the primary currency being mileage). This event appears multiple times a year and is a great way to earn mileage or get weapons that interest you. To cut the story, take any permanent weapons you dislike and either dissassemble them or put them up for sale. If the price is right, you can easily gain a lot of mileage. Using the earned money, buy whatever you like. Repeat for as long as you have patience for the game. Profit.

Along with this method, play with friends so you don't have to be frustrated with people abusing OP weapons, and the game will suddenly turn really fun. It's a flawed game, of course, but if you play it correctly, it becomes a lot more interesting and a lot less annoying to have to work with. That being said, it justifies my positive rating.

Thank you for reading, hope it helps someone."
5641,"cant remember all the old times used to blast music out loud music black friday night in my house while playing it aaah... good shit,,"
5642,"runs it on steam

gets a pop up saying requires steam"
5643,"As someone who plays this *casually*, It's good.  It's a free game, and it's fully playable (and win-able by teamdeathmatch standards) without spending any money. I've only ever paid for aesthetics (wanted a lady character), never weapons etc etc- so I wouldn't class it as pay to win as some people are saying. But then again, I only use this for the occasional teamdeathmatch games, so what do I know?
My only complaint is that people tend not to use a variety of maps when playing- which is more the fault of the players than the actual game, since there's a good number of pretty cool maps (and yet the constant stream of dust 2 continues).
Don't get me wrong, Dust 2 is a classic- but it would be nice if people mixed it up a bit more.
If you're looking for friendly players? Meh, maybe not here.
There's probably a few exception to the rules butttt....
I've found that if people are talking it's usually to say some stupid, generally insulting or racist s-

I'm giving it a recommendation because the developers have made a pretty fun game for ¬£0, and the generally bad behaviour of players isn't on the game itself."
5644,"good game

5647,"This game is good and bad for many reasones. Its good because it has a great community, and gamepley is a lot of fun. One problem i have with the game is the weapon rent system. Never really liked that. But none the less, for a free game... amazing"

Zombies almost always win unless someone has bought an instakill melee weapon that kills all zombies as soon as they get close.
Released in 2014 but runs on Hl1 engine and looks like it's straight from 1998. 
As soon as you start the game, 3 different windows with gambling minigames pop up. 
Every 30 mins you get free tickets to gamble for limited time weapons or some shit, idk.

i'm requesting a refund even though it's free."

+Zombies? Eh, whatever. Team Deathmatch, here we go!

\)(CONS)(/
-Customer Support? Of course not, it's Nexon.
-Did you like having to wait 6 minutes to join a match? Me neither, but we got that anyway.
-Hyper-overpowered laser pistols that hit about 35 times per second dealing about 45 damage with each hit,
-Nothing is explained to newcomers of games like this, and everything is confusing.

5777,"This is soo funny
- Pay to Win i have spend 70$          [ 70$ no good weapon nothing price for 1 decoder 8$] for weapon copy with CS GO more for spent i think for 1 decoder. [Other guys crazy spend spend more 500$ for just weapon im just cry.And other newbie got soo easy Magnum Drill [is possible event trading but a guy spent just 20 $ got weapon top 1,2,3 Insane].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- No Anti-Systems Hacks not working to report.Need reported for video youtube
- Hack No Recoil can't reported for video is not easy.
- AND Now playing mode: Zombie Hero ,Giant is insane so many guys got Magnum Drill or Weapon Cheat+ No Recoil + little Speed hack is not capacity human [Sprint] and this cheat can use in orignal all mode rush and soo many wallhack /Aimbot is not pro Is just Hack player just waiting and hide.Is not possible to play this game.

+Account Reset pay after long time for nothing that was good"
5778,"Its nothing more than CS 1.6 with a lot of extra content. It is true that some weapons are op and they are really hard to get since every time you get a weapon its most likely temporary (even in the crafting system), but its awesome none the less. Who doesnt love CS 1.6?"

10/10"
5797,"Hay ! 

This game can be alot of ""Fun"" if you play it with ""friends"".
It looks like CS 1.6 and the Controlls are the same...
But after some time the modes can be anoying.
The simple idea from getting guns with items is cool but
it takes to long to get an good weapon.

So I can say you if you dont own CS 1.6 or CSGO you can play it for time."

[h1]The game.[/h1]
[i]Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies[/i] is a shooting game developed by Nexon based on the classic [i]Counter Strike Condition Zero[/i]. The game offers competitive PvP and PvE modes and content from the original CS along with new game modes, maps, weapons and zombies hordes.

[h1]Gameplay.[/h1]
Yes, it's a Counter-Strike game, but it's probably your worst game. Repetitive models, every zombie is the same except for the though one that slaps you and the though one that slaps you and has this kind of stinger that shoots lasers, boxes with 30K health that require a full team shooting them for 15 minutes and empty; bland levels. The graphics of a game released in 2014 look like the graphics of the beginning of the millennium (maybe they wanted to emulate the 1.6 old-school graphics, but they failed). Zombies aren't for CS.

The game has exaggerated modes and an unbalanced power-ups system. To end in great, it's a very pay-to-win game. Good work Nexon, but you will not get my money.

5803,Its good for what it is.
5804,"8/10 good game
Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is a fun game to play, it has easy controlls, and a good scope feature.
Without trying, I got 45 kills, and 32 headshots in one life."
5805,well better graphics will do the work
5806,9/10

5811,I like this game but the game is keep crashing
5812,Its free and its really good game(reminding me on CS 1.6)
5813,"1.6 but with a lot of guns that you'd find in a modded zm_ server.
Interface is hard to understand but everything else is straightforward.
Make sure to play coop missions with people though, as AI really rushes you and it's count is static whether it's 1 or 6 players."
5814,"es un muy buen juego que es muy enretenido y divertido pero........

The Real Slim Shady

Eminem

May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're going to have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
Started whoopin' her ass worse than before, they first get divorced
Throwing her over furniture
It's the return of the ""Oh wait, no way, your kidding,
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr Dre said
Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha)
Feminist women love Eminem, chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you know what
Flippin' the you know who ""yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms
Sometimes I want to get on TV and just let loose, but can't,
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a women's clitoris is.
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is, by the time they hit 4th grade,
They got the discovery channel don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals,
Well some of us cannibals, who cut other people open like cantaloupes.
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote.
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too.
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me.
""But Slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears.
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first.
Little bitch put me on blast on M-T-V
""Yeah he's cute but I think he's married to Kim, he he""
I should download her audio on mp3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem V.D.
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
So I've been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me, who dress like me
Walk, talk and act like me, it just might be the next best thing,
But not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

I'm like a head trip to listen to
'Cause I'm only giving you, things you joke about with your friends
Inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it, and whether you like to admit it (rip)
I just shit it better than 90 percent of you rappers out there
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums, it's funny
'Cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting.
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin' he could be workin' at Burger King
Spitten on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling,
Screaming I don't give a fuck with his windows down and system up
So will the real Shady, please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And to be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

Haha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us,
Fuck it,
Let's all stand up

5844,"Good Game. Reminds me of the good old days like cs 1.6.
But with extra guns and extra game modes."
5845,"It was interesting at first, but then as more i started to play I noticed there was a gun in my hand, the gun that i killed bill the  zombie with. I have never felt so alive. do I recommened this game? the answer is no because you should already have it"
5846,It won't let me remove running game help me
5847,its just shit dont play it unless u want to pay with your kidney
5848,\/
5849,Great game. Definteley reccomend. But one thing is that you could just spend 63$ on the game (DLC) to get the full experince
5850,"This game is a guilty pleasure of mine. I love the classic CS games, and this is just More of it for free with some 'unique' added elements. The sheer amount of content here that you can dive into without paying a dime is amazing, and the game can run on a potato. So if you want a fun time waster, give CS:NZ a try! 

PROS: 
-tons of content 
-many many weapons to play with 
-free to play 
-small file size and very optimized 
-large enough community 

CONS: 
-confusing menu UI 
-lack of information on game modes leads to further confusion 
-POSSIBLE Pay To Win elements  
-lag in certain servers 

???: 
- Waifu Strike: Globally Offensive 
- WTF is this weapon model? 
- Needs more GORE 
- Bot matches are really fun if you use a double barrel shotgun!"

5853,REALLY COOL! ITS A FREE CS GAME AND HAS SOME ORIGINAL GAMEMODES TO IT ! JOB DONE NICELY
5854,I feel guilty for playing this...
5855,cool
5856,Some of the game modes are outstanding! The game mode Zombie Escape tests your awareness and quick time event the other zombie game modes are just survival tho.
5857,Best CS mods
5858,THIS GAME IS good game i played it many hours but its much pay2win
5859,will give ur virus just like in game it is very realistic
5860,"Literally the worst game on Steam.

In 25 minutes; this is what happened.

First 7: ACTUALLY INSTALLING THIS GAME.

Other 18: 
Well, first I went through a tutorial. It was awful. Game looks like absolute shit because CS:S is too hard to license.

I wondered; ""WHY THE FUCK IS THIS GAME WINDOWED???"" But that's apparently normal (?)
Got all of my free shit, it was shit. Just your average skinless ugly ass gun with a retarded description as if you would ever use the shitting thing, which will be in your inventory for 30 days. Then, because I read some of the reviews, I decoded my ""Grade 1 Ticket"" or whatever. I got some random revolver. **By the way, for some reason every single damn gun in this game that isn't bare tits stock has a name revolving around skull, or dragon, or killer, or something autistic.** That's the only description I can give for the gun, it was some strange pale peach color with highlights. The combination of graphics and that that was the only thing special about it compared to it's 48 different reskins, I couldn't tell you. 

Joined a server (Map is Dust 2) This went as badly as you could expect. The game only actually plays up to 1400x1050 resolution, even though my monitor is 1920x1080 native, so of course it was stretched garbage. Pressing ""B"" (Hotkey for opening buy menu if you are that much of a shitter) opens up what I assume would've been the old 1.6 menu, except they changed all of the boxes or filters or whatnot that show what family of gun is there. So I went through Primary, bought a FAMAS, then a P228, then I got spawnkilled. Did I mention I joined midgame? Because I had no clue. The scoreboard box is at the top of the screen, right in the centre. If you're wondering why I could'nt see it, it's because I would have to say it's as big as my fucking thumb. As in my thumbprint. So yeah, out of 1400x1050 resolution it took up about 80x30 pixels of the screen, that literally is not a joke at all. 
I respawn, and buy the same exact thing again, because I literally was the only one in the spawn, and since there is no buy timer or warmup right at the beginning of the round (to prevent me from being left behind and spawncamped so fucking hard that I uninstall before an hour of gameplay) I just ran out and hope for the best, with me only being able to buy an AUG for 3350$ (No price tags that I could see). I did what all good russian players do, and I RUSHED B. Nobody there of course, and so I turn into the tunnel and go into lower-mid tunnel. What do I know? I didn't buy ammo! So when I emptied half of my magazine to no effect at the feet of some retard on xbox, I'm left with 14 rounds in my only magazine and my shitty pistol. Shitty looking, shitty sounding, and really fucking useless. I started complaining that it didn't make any sense why I have to buy magazines as well as my shitty un-priced but still way-overcharged gear. ""Level 1"", some P2P retard says, and I gave up after that. 

In conclusion, this is what I found. 
-All of the players with female models were smashing me simply because their guns literally do triple mine's damage. This is proven when I was double-flashed by the same person as I was in A plant site, while the guy was coming into site from catwalk. He came around the box that isn't there in any good CS game, and in 3 shots hits me for 102. No matter the fact that he was using an AK47, that is ridiculous. In CS:GO, it takes a solid 7-8 shots at that sort of range to kill. 
-The only kill I got was when I rushed the hell out of a P2Per with a female model with my AUG, smacked her right in the face and still took me like 6 shots.
-DLC to win.

I could no longer take the pain of this travesty, and quit out of the game before I even had the chance to appreciate that the only rule was that you don't respawn in PVP. (Never got to the zombie mode)
"
5861,"This game is the best game i have played i rated
"
5862,yo my niggas
5863,"Played it for 4 mins, had to log on for another 1 min to reach the minimum time in order to leave a review.

Shot a zombie for 4 of those minutes, it didn't die, then I turned around and there were 8 more. I had virtually no ammo after attempting to kill just one.

Graphics and gameplay feel like something of a 15 year old game (but not even a good one)

Promptly uninstalled, nothing like the original game without the zombies (which I don't remember being called Counter Strike)"
5864,AlllUdime
5865,its such a horrible pos it wont even launch.
5866,WHO THE FUCK MADE THIS GAME!!!!!
5867,"Well, Pretty good F2P CS 1.6 with much more weapons and zombie modes. I kinda like it by some reasons. Just if you wanna play F2P CS 1.6 with MUCH MORE weapons and modes, just dowdonald and start."
5868,For a 2014 game? Complete trash. All the servers feel like 16 tick. Valve plz fix
5869,This game made me buy the real Counter-Strike so I don't have to play this crap
5870,lots of zombies swarming you play normal mode or higher its insannnnneeeee!

Just don't bother to play this game."
5879,"As a poor man's CS:GO? No.

As a solid standalone F2P zombie shooter? Yes.

Just beware the amount of grinding some people do, even though it's worth it.
Also be smart about weapons. It's quite generous to beginners with items but unless they're careful they could end up having good weapons that last a week or so instead of a permanent weapon or something that lasts a few months."
5880,"CS:NZ is copy of cs 1.6,cs:go,cs:s,cs:cn ...."

5889,My internet is very fast for example in warface europe servers never freeze also I am able to run entire counter-strike series at 200+ fps but somehow nexon zombies I don't know why it freeze especialy in multiplayer modes zombies rush at me and i don't even know where am I shooting I don't get this game idea i saw other zombie modes for other versions of counter-strike but never freeze...

5902,"First of all, as this game is free don't expect anything to ""wow"" you. The graphics are from 1999 but anywone with poor graphics can run this game with no compromises. Yo make this game better, balance the weapons because some are insanely overpowered while others are essentially useless. Also make more video options like v-sync so for anywone like me who gets 140+ FPS with a 60hz monitor to prevent screen tearing. Besides those problems the gameplay itself isn't great."
5903,Most horrible game in the free to play zombie realm :P
5904,p2w to get full experience!
5905,I ahven't even played it and it looka like a cheap rip off for cod zombies
5906,Nice Game <3 <3 <3
5907,this is so fun if you are reading this you should get this game its free
5908,"TL;CRC
Not worth it. A wasted potential already trying to continue on its last leg with less than a peak amount of players from the olden days when it had Zombies on it. Rampant microtransactions make greedy practices, weapon paint contests are now a footnote of the past (missed opportunity to score big money because of a bait-driven controversy), whole nine yards. But it had some good modes that everyone had fun playing on. It once had incentive to earn some good items, but it's nothing more than a hard grind to get some good weapons out of them, all locked behind paywalls and season passes (which it's been incorporated a long time ago).

It is better to waste your hard earned money on other games than this failed contraption of a GoldSource hotchpotch, because it'll be forgotten in dust and echoes once the last player that departs turns it into a ghost town. It's a long gone opportunity that is already falling apart fast. Not to mention that being unable to run on my new and current PC specs after changing my old ones is the final bottom of the barrel. You had your run, bud. Now it's time to rest and never be heard from again. Never forgetting the fun I had with the friends made along the way, and the laughs I made from those videos. I will never recommend it to any future single soul, so deliver yourself and your wallet from being tempted to waste it on the junk and bid it good riddance."
5909,i really like this game cause it is free and really good i hope they make more free conter strikes

5916,"I enjoyed this game while I was allowed to play it.

However, after spending $90 in the in-game shop, I tried to log in one day, only to find out that I had been permanently banned for 'macro/auto-clicker use'  which is something I have never done.
I made a ticket with Nexon support, and after 2 days they finally responded to me to tell me:
 ""We have several proof of you using macros / auto-clickers. For this reason your account will remain permanently banned.""

I'm not sure how they could have one proof, not to mention several proof of me using macros/ auto-clickers, when I have never used them, but now they are refusing to refund all the money I spent in their in-game shop.

So basically I like playing this game, until they decided to falsely accuse me of breaking their rules, and then decide to steal my money.

I would not recommend this game to anyone"

I'm not saying that this game is perfect game it has really good optimization( Actually trash optimization) . I played it like 4k hours. I was really enjoying with friends but it is died for me, when it became to a p2w game. I got a lot of good friends in there. Hanging around with friends , trying new modes with them, hunting some b*ts ,this is reeeaaaalllly enjoyable. I loved that playing with my friends every single second of it.

5937,"Once upon a time AIDS had a sexual relationship and later got married to Cancer. They then had a baby by mistake naming it Drooling Pickle and soon after due to financial problems they decided to throw it in the dumpster next to their local concentration camp.

But fear not for Drooling Pickle the now parentless retard survived this ordeal and grew up to be... an ordinary retard, becoming quite successful in his endeavours. Some time down the track our hero, Lord and savior Drooling Pickle contracted a horrible, most vile sickness in the form of Syphilis-Strike Dixon: Cheese Willy.

Drooling Pickle later passed away because of this evil thing but before doing so had spread the Syphilis-Strike Dixon: Cheese Willy not knowing that it was contagious thus bringing the dawn of a new breed of messed up bungholio.

Thus bringeth the dawneth of the worsteth piece of asstouch gameth in the year 1843 now known as Counter-Strike Nexon Zombies."

5961,"This game is like other nexon games. In other words, there are overpriced microtransactions to rent (Not buy, just rent for a limited time) items in game. Also, it's laggy, it's buggy, and the ""zombies mode"" is a joke. It plays like counter-strike except with the addition of this mode. How zombies mode works is that everyone is on the same team, and spawn in this map which is baisically a small square. No props, no buildings to enter, just a small square with walls on the sides. Then, zombies spawn at the edge of this square and do the best they can to try and kill you. Their are a few different zombie types, none of which are memorable. They also have terrible AI, as you can sometimes stand right in front of them and they will not do anything, as well as terrible pathfinding and other things. This game is a waste of your time and money."

5982,"[h1][b]Cyzz's Review of Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies![/b][/h1]

I have played this game for years, I played CSOnline Singapura before it closed, and a lot of things changed.
When I first saw CSN:Z on steam store, I knew that I had to play it.
I have played this game for two years and I never wrote a full review of it, so here it is!
First I'll tell the pros and the cons for the game, and then i'll talk about each one.
~~~~~~~
[b]Pros[/b]:
- The game has a lot of gamemodes, guns and playable characters.
- A nice quantity of playable zombies for zombie modes.
- Updates every two weeks

[b]Cons[/b]:
- You have to pay to get the top guns and characters.
- You have to pay to unlock certain events.
- Most of the updates are useless.
- The community is horrible.
- A lot of bugs.
- Old graphics.
~~~~~~~
[i][b]Pros (Extended)[/b][/i]:
""The game has a lot of gamemodes, guns and playable characters"":
Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies has 21 permanent gamemodes, hundreds of guns and a lot of playable characters.

""A nice quantity of playable zombies for zombie modes"":
On Zombie PvP modes you can play with 13 (including special zombies) different zombies, each one has his own special ability and stats.

""Updates every two weeks"":
Before we had updates every week, but now only every two weeks, it isn't that bad, even if it could be better.


[i][b]Cons (Extended)[/b][/i]:
""You have to pay to get the top guns and characters"":
The characters with the best stats for zombie scenario are all paid characters, before you could get them for free from mileage decoders, but they aren't there anymore.
With ""the top guns"" I mean lunar new year's guns (Magnum Drill, Guilhotine, Gae Bolg...) and Buff weapons (M4A1 Dark Knight, AK-47 Paladin, Blade Runebreaker), guns you can get from top50 decoders, that you can only get if you pay a lot, or if you get them on bingo's final prize, that takes months to complete.

""You have to pay to unlock certain events"":
With this I am referring to the Teddy Nightmare event, where you could get a lot of good items and decoders, but you could only create a room with this mode if you bought a DLC.

""Most of the updates are useless"":
The title says everything, but, as a example, 3 weeks ago we had a update that took three weeks to be released, and it was one of the worst ever.

""The community is horrible"":
I dont have to say anything else.
The community is full of toxic people, bug abusers, kids, etc.
In every room you will find players saying things like ""noob, f*ck your mother, f*ck you, hacker, reported, banned, etc."", most of them are turks that don't speak english but know how to say sh*t.
I am not judging all the turks, but most of them are total cancer in this game, and for some reason they have a server only for their country, but they still play on europe servers. No one understands them and they don't understand us[spoiler](players that speak english)[/spoiler]

""A lot of bugs"":
The maps are bugged as hell: You can leave the map, you can walk through the walls.
The hitboxes are horrible: Sometimes you are poiting to a zombie's head and he takes no damage, such as normal zombies (specially when crouching), deimos and ganymede (their head's hitbox is on their chest for some reason). As a venom sting, sometimes her skill doesn't infect people right in front of you, specially if they are crouching.

""Old graphics"":
This isn't a big problem, because the game is old and can't just upgrade the graphics.
-------------
After all, CSN:Z is a great game, but Nexon is a bad company, that should work better on the game.
Well, this was my review, please share your opinion on the comments!
I'll be changing the review often, with the incoming updates. I may even change the ""do you reccomend this game?"" for the same reasons as I said before.

5983,"call of duty and the magic cabin is the most impressive game nintendo has ever made. it effortlessy blends the characters we know and love from the madagascar series with the fast paced gameplay from prince of persia. this is the perfect game to buy for your little ones despite the fact that there may be some complicated words for the youngsters to understand. but if you give them a dictionary, it's all educational. best educational game since grand theft auto vice city. I give shrek 6: donkey's return a solid 10/4."
5984,I ahve alot of fun playing all the dif modes.
5985,"If you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients
- To Make the Dough
375 grams (3 cups) plain flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup (50 ml / 3¬Ω tablespoons) olive oil
1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water
Extra flour for dusting 


- To Make Cheese Filling
15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese
5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)
Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper


- Extras
Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)
Parmesan cheese
Basil
Fried vegetables
Shrimp
Fish slices
Chicken pieces 
Make the Ravioli filling.

- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.
- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.
- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

Make the Ravioli dough.

- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.
- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.
- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.
- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.
- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.
- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).
- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn‚Äôt suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. 

Fill the Ravioli shells.

- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.
- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.
- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù touch as well.
- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.
- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. 

Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.

- Roll the dough into two sheets
- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.
- Fill with the ravioli mixture.
- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.
- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.

Cook the Ravioli.

- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.
- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.
- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest 
- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates

Serve it up.
Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

As for the gameplay, from playing about 20 mins and watching other players it seems to be just ""point, shoot, pray"" or pay for a real gun. In conclusion I'd suggest not wasting the time downloading it, if you wanna play counter strike just pay for counter strike."
6023,"i like it, it is a little pay to win, but with the milage auction system you can get premium weapons without paying real cash, although it takes work."

6026,"Even though this game has a lot of hate around it I find this game to be really fun. You may find some hackers or really tryhard players, but it only takes some time to become decent at the game and not get destroyed."

A freaking simple bug cant fix and banned player for reporting it. DDOS? Try post and forum and GM will lock your thread. If got no solution, then stop this game. Toxic player in every room you can find. Kept releasing stupid mode that nobody play and ignore ddos, toxic and bug. GM abusing power and using communism style for the game. GM freely using bugs in game while other player getting banned. I report about GM friends using macro and look, the not getting any banned. How stupid is this game is now. GM pls RESIGN. Yeah Im old player since cso sea. I pour thousand of dollar for this game and look what GM gave back. You people drove player away. Fking dead game now.. less 1000 player play everyday. I WISH THIS GAME CLOSE SOON and I dont mind my money burn away rather seeing GM and other DDOS player and Toxic player kept ruin the game. Complete iron claw from GM. What a joke. How can you guys still have face to be GM if cant handle the game? If other game you guys already burn to crisp because player kept complaint. If any of you want to play this game, JUST DONT, If you play the game long enough like me since the release, its not too late to leave this shitty game. Let the GM know we the player control the game.

6036,"with theese new updates nexon has became really good game not better than csgo but better than cs 1.6 i recommend everyone to play it

6037,Thank you for making the exit game button work.
6038,"this is the best counter strike edition ever created for real and its for free too its really amazing game so much fun i recomended all the people to play this game
thanks so much for this great game :D"
6039,"Please, make some Updates. The game have bugs."
6040,"Was a great game. Thought I was gonna play it for thousands of hours. $5 later, w/ no perms, and then my game suddenly loses it's ability to launch. Just ouch. I would reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys extreme grind / CS (at all), but to anyone that isn't a fan of a monetization, and or microtransaction system............we'll simply say that, this game's not gonna help that. Had a great time, but the unlaunchable launcher? Ouch. Oh, and yes, it captures Counter-Strike just as any other Counter-Strike game does. Was a great game. I'm done with it for a while."
6041,love!

DayZ with bad graphics, no updates, germans, no recoil, 100% accuarcy, small ass maps, and you can be a zombie. Boom thats this game. Not worth the space on your computer. Do not fall for the [b]FREE[/b] price tag, trust me it isnt worth it. I rate this game a 3/10! Its a good game to burn time. Its a good game to mess around in. BUT it is not a good game."
6047,"VERY COOL FPS GAMES not only does it run almost on every computer it has ok graphics for what it gives to you.The game has a lot of guns,knife,weird guns that looks like it was in a RPG game but its very fun.Very different from any CS games."

6059,"The combat is horrible and even a clusterfuck. You can't hardly move around on some maps because of the lag spikes. It takes about one hundred bullets to kill a single zombie. The zombies make ear rape sounds, The announcers are annoying and cause brain damage. Last, the game is just Counter-Strike without the counter or strike. Also who the hell thought it was a good idea to put zombies with a matchmaking basis."

Then all of a sudden glue man will goaway and will never return to osu ever again."

so i start it again and i click on start zombie mod and the game open and while i am playing she exit again
why ??????"
6073,"This game is buggy and confusing. My stepson and I spent half n hour trying to understand the game, and just found it to be a cluster f*%$ of lack of instructions. trying to just play a hord mode game was imposible. Im sure there are people that love this game, but we just couldn't enjoy it. In the end just to uninstall the game i had to go into task manager and end the services connected to the game. It would not close and continued to request recources from both of our computers until the system was bogged down. Again im sure that there are plenty of people that love this game, but lack of instructions, confusing UI, and vampire services just killed the game for me."

6106,"[h1]This is by far one of my favorite games out of the Counter-Strike Franchise as i like to call them.

--PROS--
[] It's Free!!!!
[] Pretty much CS:GO just with an added zombie mode
[] There's Achivements that you can show off
[] And plus its a very easy game to level up in


--CONS--
[] Bad Graphics but hey none of the cs games have ""High Quality"" graphics (That compare to GTA V etc.)
[] (For me Specifically) -- Whenever I go to exit the game fully it says I have according to my PC but steam its-self says I haven't.
[] You obviously won't like it if you only play NEW NEW games.... which in my opinion is very silly cause if you play GTA V you just roasted yourself since it was public first in 2013.....




IN-CONCLUSION, One of the best counter-strike games out of the whole Franchise[/h1]"
6107,Le≈ü
6108,A nice game with good players!!!
6109,Its better to just buy cs Go or cs source becouse its a sh*t game looks like sh*t plays like sh*t physics are sh*t.
6110,"Remember the power of the AWP?? No. You know why?? BECAUSE THERE IS A FRICKEN REVOLVER SNIPER WITH %100 ACCURACY THAT WILL REKT THE SHITE OUTTA YOU!! 
If you are a competitive trying to show off your skills with the classic weapons don't even bother with it. Sometimes if you are lucky you will join a TDM where all people respect the old CS and use only classic weapons........that is untill they start losing and switch to the OP Nexon weapons that have %100 accuracy with a pinch of insta death. Pretty much if some one has the powerful weapons in the game they will destroy your a.nus and hand it to you. I won't even begin to talk about the power of the melee weapons. Let's just say you might aswell just be afk while being slaughtered by a one hit hammer or sword that throws lightning bolts. Maps are one sided as the T p.uss.ies will force the CT's into their spawn like a mouse in a cage and constatly kill you till the game ends. This is due to the maps of CS 1.6 being based on the CT's camping to protect the bomb sites and for the T's to stratecically(<does not exist in this game) find a way to plant the bomb. Again the Nexon weapons play a big role in this unbalance as you never know what the other team could be packing. This is mostly going over TDM which I talk about because most weapons from decoders are meant for TDM or DM. 

Zombies?? Oh yes thats what this game is about right? No. Again Nexon weapons are over powered and if some pr.i.ck joins the game with them, its all over. I'm looking at you DRILL GUNNERS!! As a zombie you have a chance of winning,if and only if your team decides to work together. This is only the case on some maps though which are mostly maps from CS 1.6. The maps made for mutation mode are built for campers and zombies might aswell give up as people hide in vents or simply use their power weapons. Senario modes are pretty much what you hear from other comments. Rambo shooting never stops till the game is over,so play some music,mute the game and go insane as you shoot a never ending wave of zombies,boxes with more life than i ever will have and a boss that would take you years to kill(If you play on Hard 1 and up). There are some fun modes which are worth the time,but not many people play them which makes you wonder why they even exist. 

Now let's rap this up by talking about decoders and unlocking weapons. The game, simply put lures you into thinking getting weapons is easy and there's no worry about them expiring. At first you get decoders from logging in on certain days. The guns are nice and kill with ease. You also can craft guns which in the beginning the game makes it seem like crafting has no failure rate at all. Then you start to rank up.....this is where it takes a U-turn on you. You still get decoders,but you start getting the worse weapons that look good,but don't compare with the other Nexon guns or even the original weapons. No problem because you can still CRAFT WEapons... oh it failed to craft? Never happened before. Maybe i'll try again. Another failure? Shoot, well I have plenty of gears,but not enough blueprints. I'm a lucky person...I'll try my luck..and they're all gone.. The game forces you to buy decoders as they are a sure way to get weapons everytime,but not the ones you want. Getting decoders,gears and blueprints in game is almost impossible to get. Let's say you do spend money on decoders. You will get weapons,but they will expire. I would also like to add that buying a decoder doesn't garantee you will get a good weapon. Maybe you get lucky and get a permanent powerful Nexon weapon. You will realize how pointless it is to play as you kill countless souls and make people rage till they die trying to kill you. You will begin to feel like you are good at the game,but just hope that gun doesn't have an expiration date cause when it expires you will have NOTHING!!"

6116,w
6117,"This game is realy cool , i aprove since it brings you a ton of new weapons and new modes"
6118,"Awsome,and fun to play game."
6119,"When I first looked at this game i thought it looked really fun. So i downloaded it and starting playing team death match. I really enjoyed and got great pleasure but i always found myself dying very often. Later i starting venturing into other game modes like zombie hero which i found fun. When playing i realised that people had op weapons and when they started shooting you would die in a matter of seconds. So after a while of constantly dying i decided to make a few purchases and see what i get. At the time i decided to quit tf2 and i found this game. So i sold my max's severed head and many other hats i used to have. I about 3 pound and spent it on this game. After spending all my money on decoders which are like crates bbut without keys. I didnt get a single good thing and was left very annoyed and thinking about quitting after only 50 hours of playing. I decided to play againg a few days of regret. after about a hundred hours of pplay time i spent about 50 pound on this game and got nothing and not a single premium which is like your expensive weapon.  After a few more weeks of regret i spent 10 pound and got 4 premiums. I then spent about 12 pound on this game and i got 7 premiums. So after spending way over 120 pound i have a very mediocre account.
Ive also worked out how much each weapons value is based on my experience of the weapon how rare it is and much use it gets by other players. The dominat factor is mostly how rare it is.
About haf of it is based on my own opinion and the other half is the other factors i have listed.



normal weapons not permanent 10
maverick and skull type janus balrog 50p 
good weapons last long time 1 pound
very good or permanets 1 pound or maybe slightly more if very good
Premiums 2.50
uber rare 5 to 10

Buff weapon 50 pound
magnum drill 80 pound
dark knight 65 pound
lycanthrope 70 pound 
crimson hunter 55 pound
battle 1.50

This is my mediocre account :(

6125,I have very good likeings for this game. but... one thing i hate about this game and probobly the only reson i hate it... well no graphics could be better. But on with the point. The main reson i don't like this game is because when you get a rare gun you don't ceap it forever. Witch ( if that is how you spell it) nakes me very very sad. There is a duel weld pistols that you get called the infinity pistols. But when you get them.... there not so infinity anymore.:( But i will say besides thos to resons i hate this game I really really like this game. Its like CS:GO But a little worse. There is a zombie mode i use to play. It was ok. But i really do like this game. In my list of fav games this is probobly #7 on my list.

6132,"Alright, if you are here reading reviews, im sure you are at least slightly interested in what this game has to offer:

PROS
-It's a free cs 1.6
-Huge variety of weapons
-Various game modes (Shelter mode is for you, if you are looking to co-op with your friends)

CONS
-That's a BIG ONE: Paying money gives you huge advantages in modes like Zombie Scenario and Zombie Hero ( overpowered weapons )
-Servers are somewhat laggy


I recommend it only if you are looking for free game to cooperate with your friends.





"
6133,It is a pretty good game but if you want to play cs i recommend getting global offensive cus its also a russian language tutorial.CS NZ is fun to play with friends and you have lots of things to do.
6134,Very Good my friend..!
6135,I really love this game but the ports are really bad and are impossible to play and i uninstalled for connection problems. I'm so sad to make this review but its true.
6136,"It's too much of a pay to win.
Sure it is a Counter Strike Game, and it is supposed to be competitive. But there are Pay 2 Win people who mock and make fun of people who don't use their own money to help win matches for everyone. 

Every game requires skill, yes. But if people judge by how you play and what you play with does not matter. English or Francais.

6137,yoo this game is lit except the graphics
6138,I cannot even run this peace of crap cuz this game requires steam! i don't have steam!

To actually kill a zombie you will have to buy a expensive weapon (maybe you get lucky and actually kill it), Europe server is actually Turkish server, Ranking sucks (i had 143/45 on Team Deathmatch, some guy had 7/1 and he actually was first, while I was 6th, and he ranked up), graphics ok, it's still a CS 1.6, free Mileage Decoders (something like boxes in cs:go but you don't need keys for them) and that's all i think"

I just met my first hacker and he never got kicked he was just infecting and killing people at high speed until 33 rounds so I left the room."

6157,Nicely Game
6158,"6 years after its release, Nexon's free-to-play MMO Counter-Strike spin-off has finally been released in the West as Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies. And aside from its pay-to-win aspects, which are pretty problematic for players who can't spend a lot of money in-game... it's actually a lot of fun. There's a great offering of maps and game modes, a lot of stuff to do and a lot of gear to collect. Gameplay-wise, it feels close to 1.6, which is a nice surprise.

It's an interesting spin on the Counter-Strike formula, very different from what Valve has done (and not necessarily in a bad way), and which can offer a surprising amount of entertainment. I do recommend it - it is free-to-play and has a populated and active playerbase. Give it a try!"
6159,The developers of this game. They should add both alien and robot scenarion into the mix. instead of the other two. zombie scenario and human scenario.
6160,Wow! Wow! Wow! This game is really great! :) I like it! There are a lot of cool and addictive things.

sure yeah u get cs 1.6 for free, but there are such OP as fuck guns. U have to pay for literally everything right, but for the OP as fuck premium guns, you have a small as fuck chance to get them even when you pay for it. The game looks like shit, the zombie mode is fucking boring, Team Deathmatch is broken as fuck, its just bad. 

Literal definition of nexon and P2W"

6172,it is bether then CS GO
6173,Realy Nice
6174,First of all it nexon pay to win element is in it when you play infected dont think it easy like csgo infection nope it a complete different story people who put their money into it will have 100% advantage because the weapons are not balanced you can easily get one shot out of no where having a P2W weapon does like 4000 damage if I were you get CSGO it way better graphic and no P2W elements and try to get it on sale
6175,the devs could've done (and still could) do a better job at making this a better game
6176,"Deleted game less than an hour after installing it. 

Pros- free

Cons-everything else

I play a lot of free to play. Been playing TF2 since 2008. My steam account has 9 years of service under it. I play Warface a lot also. I like most valve games. 

After installing this game and launching it, you get a not non full screen window to pick, I guess, a server. If you have never played this game, you are basically lost. IF you are a gaming noob looking to play a pc game for first time on your not so powerful desktop, this game will obviously run, but your going to be like WTF??

Secondly, graphics are straight garbage. Maybe you ask, why? It is based off old ass counterstrike game. Cool. Go watch a video of original counterstrike or Half-life (not 2) and see what you are getting. I guess deveolper decied, ""hey, Lets reskin a 17 year old game and put zombies in it to make it relevant ion 2016(2014 actually)."" Still a shit game. Honestly, I grew up playing unreal tournmant, and Quake. Played Quake 3 arena 2 days ago>Satisfied. CS zombie crap,ehhh, no. Leave old CS and Half life alone. Maybe should have modded Half life 2.

6185,"Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is a great game. I have played Counter Strike Online Taiwan for 9 years and when I moved to NA server a month ago I felt the transition was perfectly fine. The community in Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is great. A lot better than Counter Strike Online Taiwan. Players are nice to each other. This game was basically my childhood. Now let's get into the details of the game.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
The game is like a game within a game. There are lots of lot modes you can play. Zombie, Zombie Scenario, Human Scenario, Classic, and much more.
Good Community.
They bring CS 1.6 back to life with different modes while still having the original available to CSN:Z players.
They come with updates weekly which keeps the game fun and  alive.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
People with money have an advantage over players who don't spend money.
I have heard that people have been banned for no legit reason without proof that they cheat.
The game only have a family list but there is no friends list
Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies is slower when it comes to keeping up with new updates. It takes from 6 months to a year to be updated with Korea's and Taiwan's current CSO updates.
Zombie Hero is basically a Pay to WIn game. Whoever has the top guns in Zombie Hero (Magnum Drill, Warhammer, Dark Knight) usually gets the most kills and the highest score. (just look at my profile:P)

Overall this game is fun. It was part of my childhood. It has different modes and it brings CS1.6 to life. I would recommend this game to people who love Counter Strike 1.6 but want to explore with other modes or to people who love killing zombies in general.

[u]Consider Joining the Family WounDead on CSN:Z[/u]
[u]WounDead is currently recruiting CSN:Z pros:)[/u]"
6186,"Bringing back old crafting(blueprints and durables) to a degree would be a huge step back in the right direction. It was what motivated me to play. Now with irregular auctions being the best means to new guns I feel the climb to something decent got a little steep. A couple hours a day more days than not will well practiced methods on an engine I'm extremely familiar with and I could only manage a modest upgrade. If you love CS and play lots you can get good stuff for free. If you split your time between games it'll be an uphill battle. 

I got some good stuff while it was practical so I don't need to worry so much. People in PvE modes will often drop some decent stuff if you don't have it yourself so that you can use it for the map your on. Superior to old CS 1.6. Not all modes updated evenly. The entire time I've played there haven't been any new maps for Zombie Shelter mode which is regrettably my favorite. Calling it an MMOFPS is misleading It's a map at a time game like most FPS games.

There are better times to start playing and if you know someone that plays even weekly they could let you know when to start so you can get some improved weapons of your own quicker. Like most games of course it is better to play with people you know or with the same goal in mind."
6187,"It's not a bad game. There might be some pay to be better elements, but no pay to win. It's basically the original counterstrike with some Asia injected into it and with a F2P model. Fun game. Reccomend."

6212,"Pretty Dank overall
characters have very nice, well rounded, spherical personalities"
6213,Very nice game.
6214,I would give this game a thumbs up but it's made by freaking stupid asian communist. Luckily I live in America where we have the first admendment and it lets me say that Kim Jong Un is a fatty who probably hired starving children to make this game. I mean if it was made by those hentai-lovers in Japan it would probably get a better review from me to be honest.
6215,nice
6216,very good

6220,Very Interesting. It has a Counter-Strike 1.6 feel to it. But then it doesn't try it out because it is free. It comes with a mode like classic counter-strike so you get counter-strike 1.6 for free basically.

6242,decent game wouldnt pay
6243,Great game! Just needs controller support
6244,"Laggy...for no reason at all. UI isn't very simple. Most importantly: when you quit the game, it continues to run: Forcing you to end steam's process in order to kill it."
6245,"Do you remember that time in CS 1.6 when you went up on your favourite zombie server and played all day long killing zombies and kicking ass? Yes? Then this game is made for you!

This game is 100% 1.6 ([i]I mean it runs on the hl engine[/i]) concentrating mainly on zombie situations, stocked up with an arsenal of game modes and weapons. You can play the classic hostage and bomb defusal gamemodes as well if you want to feel nostalgic.

It's fun, try it. ;)"
6246,Great game gives me good memories of cs s and 1.6.
6247,great
6248,"Great Game with lots of different ways you can play;
Defeat seemingly endless waves of zombies in 'Zombie Scenario' with never before seen content, featuring pursuit style, and survival/arena style, story based gamemodes.
Survive the hordes of the night and scavenge for materials to upgrade your defences in the hard 1-4(co-op) or 4-8(team vs team) gameplay styles of 'Zombie Shelter'.
Be the Hero with exclusive weapons or be the Zombie with exclusive skills in 'Zombie Hero' and 'Zombie Mutant'; survive against former friends as they are turned into zombies, or become a zombie and infect your friends...
Or if you want to follow the original story behind the Zombie Scenario play as Soi in the 'Zombie Files' and discover the real reasons why/what happened.

Or you can play the normal gamemodes with New or Altered maps;
(Team) GunDeathmatch with never before seen weapons.
Deathmatch or (AI) Deathmatch
Team Deathmatch or (AI) Team Deathmatch
or you can choose to play the original style modes of bomb planting, VIP assasination, or ""rescue the hostage"" gamemode styles.
And you can also play Basic a game mode in which you have unlimited cash and every terrorist has a default bomb to plant, but like original, after you die you have to wait till the next round before you can rejoin... 'Basic' is an easier version of original in my opinion....

OR
You can play Human vs Human or rather human vs (bot) human in this Zombie scenario styled game mode which instead of facing off against zombies, you face off against human (bots, not actual online players) and their fiendish schemes

another gamemode available to play is 'FUN' literally called ""FUN"", this gamemode has a variety of random minigames that you can play, for example hide'n'seek is adapted to the game so that one player becomes invisible and has to try and take down the other players using only a melee weapon, this sound OP and it kinda' is except for the negative buff that the ""hidden"" player recieves: on the odd occasion when the hidden has dealt damage or has been damaged it will become visible for a short time...
Now an additional mode has been added to ""Fun"" I won't spoil it for you so I'll keep it a secret...
Oh and how could I forget, the newly added studio mode, this mode let's you edit and create you own maps using simple building blocks and elaborately shaped decoration blocks. 
Truly this is a game of wonders, however it is not a pay to win. The best player (imm korean) in the game has never spent a penny on the game. And yet look at him one of the highest ranking players in zombie HQ And the highest ranked player in the game.

'Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies' is in many ways harder and easier than your normal 'C.S:G.O.' or 'C.S Warzone' but I for one know firsthand that it is a great game and is one that I would dedicate myself to unconditionally..."
6249,"Wait, this is a zombie game?"
6250,"He he he, I always loved to play cs 1.6 zombies and all this time didn't know about Nexon zombies. Now, as I started to play, it also can not stop! Weapons crafting makes me addicted =] Good game!"
6251,no
6252,it was fun it kinda reminded me of games like black ops and how it could be better by being more like this over all good game 9/10 would recommend
6253,"Used to play when i was bored. Now when i try to revisit this game it gives me the infamous ""This game requires steam"" error message. I've tried everything from uninstalling and reinstalling several times, running steam as administrator, and pretty much everything else but all didn't work. Still reccomend but once you get that error message there's no saving your game no matter what you do with your computer."

6263,Its good game but not better than CS:GO :D
6264,"So much tribute to my childhood. So much nostalgia. It's sad to see this game getting ridiculous as guns, equipment and fighting becoming surrealistic and non-realistic.
A pretty much dead game but Respect."
6265,"Okay let me get this clear why you should download this game and their difference to CS 1.6....
-Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is just a Steam port of Counter-Strike Online. Basically, a Westernized version of CSO. 
-Both run on GoldSrc but the latter is updated over time with new game modes, maps, characters, weapons and skins.
-Yes, it's localized in several languages including Turk, Russian, Spanish, etc.

Now to answer OP's question. * If you were to take a look at the reviews first, you'll see the amount of hate posted by people. The main keyword behind this is ""Nexon"" which has gained notoriety for cramming P2W elements in their games. However! I advise you not to simply judge it just by the pictures and the reviews (obviously). Now off to the differences:

[h1] [b] CS1.6	[/b] 
-Valve
-Play with community-made contents (skins, maps)
-Your custom skins don't work on sv_pure 1 servers
-Still lots of people playing it over CSN:Z
-Valve Anti Cheat (system ban)
Unless you play on custom servers, you just stick with the default no-nonsense weaponry and characters

[b] CSN:Z	[/b]
-Nexon SARL (permission from Valve)
-Play with Nexon-made contents (occassionally player-made)
-Your purchased/ crafted items work on servers as long as you don't get banned
-Lesser player count than CS1.6 but it's because of it not receiving good response thanks to its name
-Nexon HackShield + Game Security (no system bans, but Nexon bans based on community-submitted reports)
-Although room hosts can opt for CS1.6 contents, gameplays mostly revolved around custom weapons, skins and maps
	[/h1]

Now both are double-edge swords. While people still love the originality of CS1.6, CSNZ provides a different style of gameplay in addition to CS1.6 contents. It offers new maps, gameplay, skins and weapons that players could explore and enjoy.
CSN:Z no doubt has its own cash shop that allows players to make (optional) purchases but Nexon has altered the formula to be more generous for Western players. For instance, giving players 10 free decoders (think of CSGO's weapon cases + keys) daily for more than a month. In total, you have over 300 of them without the need to fork out a cent.
"
6266,terrible just dont get it!
6267,The fuck did I just play...?
6268,Really disliked this game. Just was not for me.
6269,I've had more fun being sent to buy flour for my mother than playing this
6270,+/-
6271,This game is honestly a double egged sword .. on one hand it can be extremely frustrating as a zombie to have to deal with extremely OP weapons that kill you in 5 seconds. The other it's a fun game full of excitement and killing zombies.. your choice
6272,"NO, just no"
6273,"I had this game in my library for 5 months straight. When I started playing it again. You could see that alot of changed.
Even though I'm a CS 1.6 player aswell, In my opinion this game is not bad"
6274,one of the best
6275,i was playing this game since i was lil atleast 10 years old i think and this game is really fun.
6276,"So I've been playing this game like over 1 month and I really like this game. I was a huge CS 1.6 fan and thats why I love this game quickly. I have CS:GO too but I prefer playing Nexon because it reminds me CS 1.6 and all of those adventures during play the game. So if you dont mind graphics I suggest this game to you and also I gotta say there are a lot of good mods such Zombie Scenario and Zombie Giant and Gun Deathmatch in this game. I spend a lot of time in this mods. Also, it is free and you wont lost anything if you dont like. Dont hesitate,download and play !"
6277,"cs:s mod basically ._. 



still 10/10 :]"
6278,still better than csgo.
6279,"The best game 
Free and good"
6280,"HitBoxes are shit
And a classic pay2win
Also Many Hackers"
6281,"I initially downloaded this game to play because of the achievements. I saw that there were around 100 achievements all with the playerbase that had less than 1% of which that didn't achieve them. I thought to myself, oh man I can outgrind all these guys and just play it out. Boy was I wrong, there's a reason >1% have them.

First you're thrust into a clusterf**k of a menu with buttons everywhere with absolutely no explaination on where to go or what to do. Finally you find the find server button and start browsing more menus that you don't understand the game modes or how they differ from the last. You finally get into a game, and you're jumping into the deep end of the pool, where everyone else knows what to do and seems to have outgrinded the hell out of all these items or maybe even P2W items that seem really unfair. You get killed, and become a zombie where you get some abilities or something but have to choose which type you want to become but the game gives you no explaination on what your abilities do or how you differ from the possible other 12 zombie choices. Sometimes you get the chance to become a VIP or assistant VIP and it comes with the benefit of unique weapons, which the game of course doesn't explain what does what or how much damage or anything.

TL;DR: A total mess of a game that took the elements of CS 1.6/CS:Source/CS:GO's zombie mode games and trashed it with this half baked NEXON clusterf**k garbage. Good luck navigating menus, browsing reddits, and reading wikis on who does what and how and what you should aim for and what you should grind towards or what you should purchase."
6282,great game i love it
6283,i ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing got shot in the head! why would anyone want to be shot in the head or even shoot other people? This games ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up

6288,a great fps if you enjoy games like counter strike
6289,Good Game :D :yay
6290,Everybody says that this game is pay to win... i think its not u just have to spend time at the game its fun and the zombie gameplay its amazing! you can get allmost every weapon by crafting. that means its not pay to win. the zombie escape gameplay its fun and i recomend triyn the game its not big.
6291,Trash
6292,"Long time ago played this game and since i had money problems, liked cs 1.6 and zombies, was must get game for me. But developers where keep adding more and more and at the end i lost interest in this game. But still am very thankful to this game as it helped me pass hard times."
6293,Pretty good for a free game.
6294,"spawned, put a full LMG clip into an enemy and did'nt die, kys"
6295,Very good game however if your not into pay to win don't get it
6296,"Bad game, just Counter Strike with mods from GameBanana"
6297,No League in cs plz
6298,Nice game for a first few hours.
6299,"This game is basically ""Crazy fucking weapons the game"""
6300,"nice game i curructly like it and i payed it for 3hours from the first downoload.

[h1] All In All	[/h1]
This is a great game for a free version of counter strike kinda. You can play bot team deathmatch, or well...bomb or defuse, and with other people and also get the old counter strike. You can get cool new guns like CSGO they look like skins new types of knives i really love this game"
6310,Bad quality..
6311,"I'm not gonna lie, this game seems to be pay to win.
We have these little bullsh*tters with these overpowered guns and bs.
That cost money,
money.
It's impossible to play this game.
If you want an actual good game, get the original cs, or cs:s, and better yet, CS:GO.
Don't waste your time on this CS 1.6 ripoff with more weapons and zombies.
That's it.
"
6312,shit
6313,How the fuck do I do anything?
6314,Its a good free game
6315,"pros
+ alright wepions
cons
- overpowered zombies
- zombies don't look like zombies
- boring combat
2.3/10"
6316,Zombies. Meh...
6317,CD Keys.....
6318,Really fun
6319,Good game
6320,"The worst Counter Strike game i've seen yet. Zombies weren't meant to be placed in a  game like this.
Plus, they add additional weapons in which you have to get to git gud.
0/10 Pay to win."
6321,v goud game 10/10 would def play the again
6322,"This is actually a fun game, it has tons of maps, tons of game modes, it has a weapon collection feature wich is gratifyingn and yeah you will like this game ( in spite of the graphics being outdated, just look past it XD)"
6323,The game its very very nice and good to play and please make the game not pay to win
6324,Very good game with fantastic weapons and with phenomenal zombies
6325,"It's a good game if u want to remember how 1.6 was(with some extra guns and more models in this one). And tons of mods. CSGO has familiar stuff too but on workshop and servers.
"
6326,good game :)
6327,"Only played since I didn have csgo
trash game
"
6328,Free 1.6... But i dont know... its a little bit boring. :D
6329,omrete we nekson celiq stiim si namali shitnite samo vie ne
6330,wtf is this bull shit
6331,Pretty shit tbh
6332,VERY FUN game I rate a 9/10 most of it is because on how it can run on almost ANYTHING even a potato.I played a lot of CS when I was little and I still play it!So much fun in 1 game.
6333,"Nice alternative for 1.6 be cause is free but zombie is noo cool. If u wanna play add to friends
"
6334,not good
6335,great
6336,very good
6337,"this game is awsome. i spent 31hours playing it. just DO NOT DONLOAD THE STARTER PACK. the starter pack will compleatly break your game and ones its dounloaded its dounloaded. i cant fix my game, if i nknew how i would say. sorry
"
6338,it say it Running but nothen is up i Mit need to Remove and Readd it but it wont let me
6339,"It's not my favorite game, but it's worth checking out."
6340,"Pretty cool, not completely PAY TO WIN now!
You actually have a big chance to gain premium guns without spending money and you have alot of fun now.

I recommend this game!
It's quite fun!"
6341,Top game  ‚ô•
6342,This game is all out good if you're looking for Counter-Strike that has Zombies.   10/10  Love playing it.  :D
6343,"it a fun game if bored
"
6344,"runs well, i enjoy playing it. but whenever i shut the game down (Like select quit and whatnot) it still says it's running and it won't let me reopen the game unless i completely shut my computer down"
6345,"This Is Exacxtly Like A Free Counter Strike Source, Just Go On Basic Gamemodes. Then You Are Good To Go!"
6346,still better than csgo
6347,This is cool game!!!
6348,shit
6349,gg good game no hackers yet XD
6350,This game is a great game if you are looking for a free alternative to CS:GO. It really takes a good turn on the First PersonShooter genre with the ability to play as a zombie. The main user interface seems a bit confusing at first but I got the hang of it
6351,"Based on CS 1.6. Crazy complicated, round starts and you have like 10 seconds to equip and find a place to fight. This is just a crazy complicated version of the old CS Zombie mod."
6352,is this 1997 again ?
6353,csnz is just the original but with zombies so you could call it cs zombies mode
6354,"it has a virus
"
6355,"Its alright
"
6356,Better then CS:GO right now
6357,"""this game requires steam""

10/10 would think about existence again"
6358,"Good way to kill an afternoon.  That's about it.  Couldn't figure out how to exit the game, esc menus were frozen/not responding even though game was running fine.   Had to ctlaltdel to get out, but after closing app it was still running...couldn't exit out of it via Steam, couldn't exit Steam b/c it was ""still running"".  Had to restart computer.  Deleting it."
6359,"wow , this game is pretty cool!!!!"
6360,"This game sucks dick you might ass well buy csgo for 15$ than play this free crap
"
6361,"No Just buy csgo Pls!
 
EDIT: this game is still the biggest cash P2W scam there is aside from EA."
6362,pay to win if you buy weapons you can only use them for like a week.
6363,Does anybody know how to delete a game from your steam library?
6364,"It is good but 3 bad things Bad detail,some zombies are almost impossible to kill,and anime and this does not mix"
6365,Its really nice. And free too :)
6366,"shit game, free though so why not"
6367,niggah
6368,nice and fun game i liked it is very nice for your time :)
6369,Counter Strike Nexon : Noobies :D
6370,"My friend didn't want to pay CS:GO so he installed CSNZ.


He said that it was ""the same"". 


He recomended me it.


(I play the game)


Friend: well, is the game is good?

Me: remove the words ""counter strike"" right now.

1/10 what a Pay to Win, glitchy game."
6371,"There is a few things that I guess quite a lot of people tried this game had miss out:
‚Äì There is a lot of grinding, money only make it go faster.
‚Äì You can have permanent weapon if you have multiple acc. and let them offline after weeks :P
‚Äì MacOS can play this game on VM, just lag is unbearable.


Overall I would give this game 7/10, just because it's not a shooting skill game, it's a grinding game!"
6372,ES
6373,pay to win
6374,TOO MANY MEXICANS JK JK IT WAS BAD HAD BAD ASS GRAPHICS AND ITS SHIT ITS JUST SHIT ON MY HARD DRIVE
6375,"tae
"
6376,They made a minecraft update!
6377,"You spend money to later erase your progress/Gastas dinero para despu√©s borrar tu progreso

He jugado este juego desde 2015, compre cajas e incluso skin tipo dlc que ya no se encuentran actualmente y me arrepiento, la primera vez borraron algunas cuentas debido a cambios de pol√≠tica en el cual estuve activo y no hubo problemas incluso recib√≠ una recompensa, obvio hab√≠a gente afectada de este primera purga,  deje este juego por un tiempo ya que estaba con otros juegos y mi vida personal, unos 2 a√±os despu√©s vuelvo para darme cuenta que sucedi√≥ una segunda purga, por algo de cambio de licencias y eso como en la primera. todo mi progreso lo perd√≠ y deje el juego ya que no val√≠a la pena perder todo de nuevo, aparte de que es un juego p2w que esta desbalanceado, he visto que han agregado nuevas updates de construcci√≥n, pero la verdad no vale la pena. descubre otros juegos porque si dejas este por un tiempo seguro no ves tus cosas cuando vuelvas, no s√© si sea un truco para volver a gastar tu dinero con este m√©todo.
I have played this game since 2015, I bought boxes and even dlc type skins that are no longer currently available and I regret it, the first time they deleted some accounts due to policy changes in which I was active and there were no problems, I even received a reward, obviously there were people affected by this first purge, I left this game for a while since I was with other games and my personal life, about 2 years later I come back to realize that a second purge happened, for some change of licenses and that as in the first. I lost all my progress and left the game since it was not worth losing everything again, apart from the fact that it is a p2w game that is unbalanced, I have seen that they have added new construction updates but the truth is that it is not worth it. discover other games because if you leave this one for a certain time you won't see your things when you come back, I don't know if it's a trick to spend your money again with this method."
6378,"If your looking for a review, only read mine, the rest will be utter trash and will make you think like a gone off lemon in a weed-dealers bag. 

This game isn't Pay to Win.
Because by playing zombie survival mode (co-op against ai and player controlled zombies) you can get tons of Milage Decoders (use em to play bingo and get really nice perm guns). Or just play original or funnily named, Bombing mode. 
And with my time playing i got a few perm guns and they sometimes give you premium decoders (they give you perm premium guns) too. So don't listen to the people givin' this game hate. It isn't deserved."
6379,cool game
6380,sucks
6381,"don't even bother to download, just don't."
6382,If you can't run CS:GO well you come to the right place
6383,Two Words... Bad. Ass.
6384,"This is basically true cancer\; I don't care about the grapics style, but you want to know what I care about, it's the gameplay; and this game has the gameplay similar to Pong, which aired on the commadore 64 [actually it aired in  a arcade]

Y 1 tem no gud, and othr OPP



Also Pay to Win"
6385,Respect Nexon Really a great :)
6386,[h1]One of the best I think..[/h1]I would give a 5 star rate on this game! Killing Zombies in Counter-Strike takes the game on a higher level! Comparing to original series without Zombies there are more weapon than enough..  Scenario and Hero modes are cool. And of course it's Free!! Come and join to play! :)
6387,"Its a chill old school game,its free soo try it out."
6388,"You can skip all this zombie mumbo-jumbo and play clasicc gamemodes (death match arms race etc) (1.6 era graphics) 
(zombie mode dont suck but its not my thing)"
6389,"I Can't...this game is so horrible and mind numbing. i mean it plays like you dont take it serious and it feels like a child made it. I tried to just be a mindless fuck and play with no thoughts in my head but even then it was horrible. Pay2Win out the ASS, everything is inconsistant and rubberbanding out the ASS. If you enjoy this go ahead and play but this shit has got to stop popping up on steam"
6390,"160 kills / 51deaths, 100 headshoots, 2granate kills in Deathmach... How culdn't I like this game? :D 
It's Nice one"
6391,Counter Strike: Mobile
6392,Awesome game but it's PayToWIN...
6393,The best thing I can say about this game is that it wasn't the worst thing I've ever played.
6394,Yeeeeeaaaaah NO
6395,gave me cancer
6396,"This game is good, but won't shut down properly"
6397,"Great Game, wish it was easier to get cooler guns and such for people who dont play as much tho."
6398,very fun in 30 minutes and then after doing that you just wanna die. In other words 10/10
6399,"i rly liked what youve done with the place
"
6400,"Amazing game, I recommend it to anyone who first started CS with CS 1.6 and is used to old style play and graphics."

6406,Hi
6407,This game is garbage
6408,The most PAY TO WIN game ever. But even people who don't spend money on the game can actually enjoy it. Its pretty easy to unlock guns even though they aren't permanent unlocks.
6409,noob
6410,"If this game was made for the purpose of making me want to uninstall it....it did its job....

6417,"mmmm it like old counter but really bad , horrible graphics and boring"
6418,nice
6419,Adding to the many downvotes of this boring game
6420,This is the best free game on steam well not really
6421,"""The zombies will attack"" ""We have been enslaved by the zombies""

-The terrible lines in this game/10"
6422,I have put alot of time into this game and I can personaly say it is really well made if you want to find out what counter-strike is like play the original mode and there are tons of different modes and things to explore however good weapons you either have to buy or have them last about 7 days before you have to craft them again
6423,very good to play with friends
6424,"Says that I need Steam to run this, even though It's from Steam. ._. 
I guess this is where I must say that the best part about this game is uninstalling it."
6425,The Best Game ‚ù§
6426,Utter ass
6427,"Looks like a cool and fun game,  just sucks that there is no support for using a controller on the PC.

I uninstalled it without even playing it so can't really say if it is any good or not."
6428,"i know its chinese, but it still has that classic 1.6 style, although zombies mod isnt that bad( i mostly like zombie shelter)"
6429,Worst game Ive ever played...
6430,it gud game if u haf no csgo or scource :D
6431,I mean the game is decent. Plus its free atm so why not pick it up now and give it a go!
6432,"not a bad game, could have left out the  quest bs."
6433,it's fun
6434,it is good to waste time on
6435,"I mean, it's okay. It has the typical Nexon bullshittery like stupid cosmetics, scantily clad women characters and most of the good shit is only rental, from as far as I could tell. Like the name states, it has them zambos at it again, and the counter strikers set aside differences with the bad bomb men and stop them, or until one of them fucks up by not buying a machine gun and they all die happily ever after. But if you don't want that nonsense, you can have regular Counter Strike, but with the option to: BÃ∂uÃ∂yÃ∂ Rent weapons from the store I think; Rent Weird scantily cladded women skins; Rent more realistic skins of Asian Counter Terrorists and Terrorists; Make silly looking guns that last for a week; and maybe other stuff I don't know, I played this for 20 minutes. It really can trigger PTSD of old PÃ∂aÃ∂yÃ∂ Ã∂tÃ∂oÃ∂ Ã∂WÃ∂iÃ∂nÃ∂  Free to Play Korean game players like Combat Arms vets, Crossfire, etc., so be warn. So do I recommend this? Personally, no, but if you want to experience the 1.6  days but strapped for cash and unable to buy the $10.00 bundle that gives you the 1.6, CZ and CZ:DS then this is the next best option.

tl;dr  It's Combat Arms but in Counter Strike, play at your risk."
6436,It's okay I guess
6437,"So just to clear it. It's Pay to Win, In every single mode, or you just log on each day until you have 1 week and have a chance for a good weapon since you get 2 decoders.

Original/Deathmatch:
It's great if you want to play with friends, has many ways to play it, you don't like playing the zombie aspect of the game? well no worries since you can always play Deathmatch or Original which is just a 1.6 version. But the biggest problem is that you can use the OP weapons from the zombie gamemodes (they're alot), but I'm going to say they are actually few playing using op weapons on Original or Deathmatch mode. There alot of guns to choose from you can either 1. craft them 2. unlock them by using Decoders or 3. by using the points that you get from Decoders to play Bingo and get weapons that way. 

Zombie Escape/Zombie Suvival/Zombie Scenario:
it's really fun to play each mode with friends or just alone, but in Zombie survival you're mostly going to encounter ""Pay to Win"" players you notice them by either, Really OP af guns, an Paid character and is level 30+. it's still fun to play Zombie Scenario since it's one of the core elements or the game, it just feels right to shoot and slaughter trough massive groups of Zombies and can be challanging or easy good for beginners and Hardcore pro gamers who feel the need of a challenge, There many Difficulties to choose from and the higher you go the more XP you get. 

I would says this games does it right, but I think they should add a option to maybe disable OP or weapons that are made for Zombies mode from Original/Deathmatch lobbies. It's fun if you're bored or just want to have fun with friends and is a great counterpart of Counterstrike 1.6 since this game is for free and has alot of modes to choose from.

I hope it helped you decide if you want to play this game or not, and remember don't judge a book by it's cover, Never hurts to try right? :D

 irresponsible support."
6517,Noooooo No No No No
6518,"Eh i say its pretty good, there are a few problems here and there but its great"
6519,"Ok, so i was expecting this to be the same game as cs... i was wrong... WAY WRONG! It is like an arcade version of cs in a good way. Ever heard of Call Of Duty Online? Well, This game is simular. People Say its Pay To Win, Well Its not. They just don't know how to get good weapons. At first, you'll hate this game. But it gets good as you level up. People also say its nothing like cs. Well, Thats true in some ways. But it still has some of the same mechanics. But Its differences are good. People then say the graphics are terrible... And they are totally right. But a games graphics don't determine if the game is great or not. The only two real problems i have with this game, is that on tdm, on dust, all the terrorists camp at the counter terrorist spawn and none of the counter terrorists ever can get anywhere without being killed. my other complaint was that in the market, when you want to purchase somting thats like $0:75, you have to add funds, and you can only add $5 or more. Plz Make it where we can buy things without having tho add funds. thats all. And I love this game!!! Great Job, Nexon."
6520,like it
6521,"look i will be straight, i love this game i am an old timer from CSN:Z when it was CSO instead i had alot of fun and met alot of people but......again 1 small issue, Nexon please fix the voice chat support issue, nobody in csnz can use voice chat beacuse it dosent support it at all i have a perfectly good mic that works in every game but every time i try it on csnz i sound like a broken radio, thats all"

6564,"For quite some time now, I've been holding off from revising my review for CSN:Z, however I don't wish to deceive people with my old review. This game has evolved into an utter catastrophe. Just by looking at my old review, you can identify most of the strong attributes of this game. Nexon Europe for the most part, was doing OK with keeping this trend a reality in the game. That was the case, until Nexon Korea came into the picture to crash the party. Nexon Korea fails to cater toward the European/American market. Everything now is essentially something that you have to pay for. The events which make it possible to earn ""free"" stuff are there, more so to instill belief in players that Nexon is attempting to appease player that don't spend money; which is innately not the case. In actuality, you'll run ""buffed people"" as well as ""buff weapons,"" which give the human player the most ludicrous abilities and advantages. In turn, abilities are well beyond the limit to their zombie counterparts as well as the free to play players, in contrast. It is arduous to find the precise purpose for this game when taking into account what it has become. Perhaps, back then during the period of time when I posted my positive review, I would have said that it is without a doubt, that this was indeed a respectable game. Currently however, considering that you can buy Counter Strike Complete or GMOD, to subsequently uncover that there is a myriad of things that you can do without paying 1/100 of dollar more, Counter Strike Nexon Zombies, is nearly minute.       












(*Intial Review)

(Counter Strike Nexon Zombies is the perfect alternative if you don't want to pay money for CS:S or CS:GO. There is a plethora of anomalous and typical content. The advent of zombies adds to the already superb base game. Download it's not going to hurt!


Here is a story of how I met some of the friendliest pro players ever. (This is the only game that I have met such nice players so easily

I decided one day that I would play zombie shelther to kill some time. My team was cool and pretty understanding of what you have to do to survive. To my surprise we finished the level in 10 days when it will usally take 20. Our base was a fortress with traps and turrets on every corner that needed protection. They were great players and we all wanted to friend each other when the match was over to play more however, there is no friends list :(. This is my one gimmick, the fact that you can't friend anyone is unacceptable in my book. Considering that your account in CSNZ is not linked to your Steam account there is no way to friend the person through Steam.  

So please Nexon pretty please add the friends list, the game would be near perfect once it is implemented :D)*

6582,"Game itself is a very well made F2P version of oriinal Counter Strike.
Some players might think it is a Pay to Win game.

To be honest, this is kind of truth.

There is a very advanced system of dropping weapons, which differ in use.
You can earn them from Daily Gifts, but real pearls are from Decoders.
Decoders are given to player in several ways, but most common is:
- Daily gift for 5 days logon in a row
- After one hour of gameplay per day.
The reason it is pay to play, is that those decoders are also available for real money,
starting from half of a dollar per one. Players that paid for much of them, will get way more better weapons than other players, what causes(especially on deathmaches or original games) destruction of free users.

My verdict is 6,5/10 -> Positive:
+Great reproduce of original CS
+Good additions and fixes
+Weapons skins
+Additional weapons
-Paid players get more advantage
-Skins are only available for payment
-No ability of blocking non-original weapons when making room"
6583,really good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6584,the competitive scene is deep.

 PRESENTATION - 4

 Very difficult to figure out what is going on. Bots are great, but overall lacks a good HUD.

 SOUND - 6.5

 Dated, but still brings a blast in intense gamemodes.

 GRAPHICS - 7

 Graphics are dated and lack detail, but are still full of smooth motion and clean textures.

 GAMEPLAY - 9

 A very intense gameplay, it's always fun to be running from zombies and also BEING one.

 LASTING APPEAL - 3

 With little communication, I don't really see myself coming back."
6609,"nice game its very fun play with friends

However the graphics could be similar to Counter Strike Source, but i'll accept the classics."

6614,This game is trash. It is basically 1.6 with community mods that gave your windows XP a virus.
6615,"good game
"
6616,"I don't hate the game, but the zombies are op one shot is like one damage. Other than that it's kinda like hide and seek oh and the inventory, let just say you won't like it. I just think if there nothing else to do give it a try."
6617,"Terrible game, either hackers or P2Wers everywhere."
6618,fajna gra :)
6619,the infamous and beloved Counter strike frenchise  :)
6620,thats a great game
6621,bad
6622,"Although it's free, it's horrible. My biggest complaint is the brightness of the models. I can't see the models of players in open spaces, which frustrates me incredibly. All in all, this game is the worst port of 1.6 MADE IN 2014 BY KOREANS. I THOUGHT KOREANS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE GREAT AT THIS STUFF."
6623,"i love this game cuz i can give free hugs 
"
6624,"This game is a disgrace to the CS franchise. I played it once, and i HATED it. 0/10 at least cs go is better"
6625,looks nothing like the trailer XD
6626,"Nexon team never fails to keep us satisfied with every other update. Well done. The number of players is still growing down unfortunately,  even tho the game is more than great. Totally recommend,  and be patient. Everything can be unlocked for free"
6627,"For a free bootleg cs 1.6, this really impressed me"
6628,Any game that lets me kill zombies is OK in my book
6629,NICE GAME IS CS 1.6 MIXED FREE
6630,"I have invested a 180 hours into this and this ended being my most played game on my profile... But as it got updated it beacame stupidly boring. Yeah the graphics are not great but from what i researched this was suposed to be an expanded version of CS : CZ with just more zombie content.

Now the reasons it's kinda good i guess?

Its not like the usual game copies which would normaly give you 1 and only gun to use and you would get new guns with micro tranzastions... But this gives you all of the basic CS CZ weapons on level 1. That's ok.
Fun gamemodes. There are a lot of fun and interesting game modes like Rocket battle and the hidden. And i can say that they dont require any p2w weapons to play them.

Now the reasons it's bad.

Firstly a lot of micro tranzactions... The normal weapons are quite balanced betwent them but when we enter the crafted and payed weapons it just gets silly how underpowered the basic weapons are... Lets take the ARX-160 for an example its a full auto zoo-mable assault rifle which can 1 tap headshot from long rage. Someone would say its the same as the AUG and the SSG53 but nope! The ARX-160 is way more acurate has a little bit of a damage boost and its firerate will melt anybody in 2-3 seconds.
Decoders : I can say that they have been a good here and there but the drop rate is just silly... Why? Well lets take my friend who was level 2 for an example... We were playing together on christmas when there was a 10Decoders per day or something like that. He got 5 premium weapons out of that from which were the Tempest and the rest were gold weapons... Me who opened atleast a 1000 decoders and payed for 10-30 of them got no golds or premiums... i understand its pure luck but seriously?
Finaly spawn camping and other cheaky things thet win you the game easily... Spawn camping is really comon on Dust 2 with a lot of LMG and AS-50 on the terrorist side. And there are some zombie hero spots which just seem kinda of unfair beacuse of the way you get to them.

Would i recommend this game?
Yes and No.

This game just seems too much p2w and i dont like those types of games where who pays for the features in the game gets an unfair advantage.
And the availablity of those weapons is pretty low. One thing that might help is returning daily mission decoders back for full time. That might get the game up again.

So in the end i wouldnt reccomend this game if you dont like p2w game's and if you dont like crappy graphichs ( i personaly like playing old games sometimes but this got me like attached to it till i hit 80hours then i returned to Diablo 3)"
6631,"game used to be good

6634,"Great game from Valve and Nexon. The two companies combined well to create a nice free online FPS game :) I used to play Nexon's Sudden Attack (Online FPS) and seems like Counter-Strike's original beautiful gameplay has integrated well with Nexon's new characters and weapons.

I can't wait to have Clan Wars :)"
6635,i am tru slav
6636,"I had so much fun uninstalling this game, The only problem is that it was over too quick, I couldn't savour the moment. I now have cancer as a result."
6637,"Its basically a free crappier CS:GO, whats more to ask?

Ok but seriously it can be p2w at times but if you play with your friends it can be a blast. Sure graphics are bad but the plus side is it runs like a prostitude giving birth, smooth."

You can correct me for saying it was made in 2014(I don't the accual date it was made), but these are like Xbox Original graphics. However, if you don't want to buy CS:GO just get get CSN:Z for free, there is team deathmatch and all the other originals, but if you want a good zombie mode, get Left 4 Dead or Left 4 Dead 2."
6699,Awful.

6721,"I played this game a few minutes and even from the begining, i did not like it. The graphics are poor, not many people play it and the goal of the game is not htat interesting. I wish this game had some deathmatch servers w/o zombies, beacause it ruins all the fun.

Basically, i do not recommend this game. If you wanna try it, its for free so theres nothing to lose!"
6722,So bad
6723,"Well where do i start?

It srsly shouldnt have the name Counter Strike in it...  Trailer doenst look so bad but the game... oh god no pls no...
In zombie mode everyone is just camping in one place and just spray like there is no tomorrow... As a newbe u dont have any chance to kill someone who played it for a longer time... They have like a speer chainsaw mix? IDK :D... Its crazy.

Well i dont recommend it cuz u know... its not my fav game :) But you can try it^^

"
6724,◊ö◊ó◊õ◊ô◊ó◊ò◊ï
6725,"Very good game... I love 1.6, 2nd game is this"
6726,mkay its pretty good
6727,"*starts game*

*game crashes*

great game."
6728,"Nope, nope nope! Its pay2win all the way"
6729,"Finally after playing this game for over probably a year now I can review and say everything that I'm honest about this game. 




 Overall this game is pretty much fun and kinda competitive since everything is about zombies and killing them.Over the pass few months/year I've gotten a lack of experience on playing this game and it's really fun unless you have good guns I wouldn't be happy and wouldn't be spending a lot of time on this game due to getting the guns for free pretty much ... So I would probably rate the game 

7/10 
Because there's still a lot of bug/glitches that is still been around the game since it came out and Nexon still have to add more servers because every time I play all I see is people with 100-200 ping.  

So that's it my truly honest opinion about this game 

I recommend this game for people that are f2p :""''''''>  

LOL


UPDATE: NOTHING yet.."
6730,"don't
(unless you like games where you can get one-shotted with a paid gun that does 200+ damage that isn't even a sniper rifle)"
6731,NOPE!!! This game idea was pretty decent i may say. Overall its just P2P and i don't reccomend it!
6732,greate for ESL
6733,it's a fine game. Very fun to play but has a lot of bugs
6734,Bug as ^^******
6735,OMG OMG OMG LOVEE THISSSS
6736,This game is good!! BC it's like counter-strike 1.6
6737,"iz gud game 10/5, would fuck again"
6738,"It's fucking gay as shit
"
6739,I'm able to load the game but game crash when loading any map..

6742,needs controller
6743,This game is good
6744,cool and good games of counter strlke
6745,"Its a GREAT game,but the only problem is zombie classic or ANYTHING with bots.The good thing abour the bots are they actually know when and how to retreat adding a sense of challenge when your trying to kill them but whats bad is well...FRIGGIN MICSPAM! *enters game with full volume* *leaves hospital with no ears*.Anyways,the game IS good and alright..."
6746,It wouldn't work. This game is not good.
6747,I like how you can never rebuild the Lego M4 to a dual weilding colt pistol. But instead it's a truck mounting a rocket.

6757,"[h1] Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies Review	[/h1]


Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is a Free to Play MMOFPS offering competitive PvP and PvE action including content from the original Counter-Strike and all new game modes, maps, weapons, and hordes of Zombies!



[u] [b] + Pros	[/b][/u]

[list]

    [*]A lot of gamemodes to choose from.
    [*]Many servers to play in, There are always people playing. 
    [*]You can play the classic Counter-Strike.

[/list]



[u] [b] - Cons	[/b][/u]

[list]

    [*]The game is poorly optimized.
    [*]The game is PAY TO WIN. simple as that.
    [*]Sending a ticket will result in no answer at all.
    [*]Alot of hackers get into the game without getting banned.
    [*]The ports are really bad and are impossible to play.
    [*]The stun. Everytime you get hit, you get stunned.
    [*]VIP system, P2W events, P2W weapons, P2W skins, Again, P2W.

[/list]



Absolute disappointing game. Take a good franchise with years and years of eSport scene, and let some mediocre people ruin it. There were zombies mods for CS 1.6, making it ‚Äúofficial‚Äù doesn't make it better. In fact, it just makes it worse."
6758,"5% luck
5% Pay2Win
90% waste of time(Gametime that is)"
6759,"I met a guy on this game and let him cum in my ass, thanks."
6760,very fun...but can get alittle stupid in lots of ways like op wepons
6761,"Recommended only if you can't afford any other Counter-Strike

But still it's about fun and not competitive game like in CS:GO"
6762,"bad graphics, bad game play.  like building a level in Doom with no direction"
6763,Hj
6764,Put a ton of hours into this game and loved every hour of it :)
6765,it sure is.
6766,"I cant get a real full screen it really sucks.
"
6767,this game gave me str8 aids no joke not taking my meds tho its just a ploy by the goverment to make money.
6768,"kk
"
6769,Good
6770,"The game will launch for a couple seconds and then say ""Steam is required"". It is so moronic that I'm writing this review over something like this. I wouldn't recommend it, because I don't know how it plays, but If you get it to work, tell me how it turns out."
6771,"Having a computer that runs battlefield 4 on MAX , this game constantly loads that that first screen, cant do anything. When running "" Verifying integrity of game cache... i get ""3 files failed to validate and will be reacquired"" and then nothing happens. 0/10 waste of time"
6772,"i mean this is free so...., but more than that i wont buy
"
6773,Game is going down the hill at the moment but had very much fun hopefully updates will be better in future .
6774,"1.P2W.
2.one of the worst game on steam.
i want to make a top10 list of the worst game on steam ,this is one will be on TOP1."
6775,"Can you put on dark knight upgrade on, I just lurned how to ugrade stuff now :D
"
6776,"IF YOU LIKE CS 1.6 YOU CAN PLAY IT 4 FREEE (CLASSIC MODE). YOU LIKE TO TRY MODS LIKE GOLD SOURCE HAS? TRY THIS GAME'S MODES. WANNA SEE HOW IS IT TO PLAY TDM WITH OVERPOWERD LASER SNIPER RIFLE / ACID SPITTING PISTOLS OR OTHER CRAZY WEAPONS, WELL PLAY THIS GAME. YOU CAN TRY IT PVP STYLE, WITH BOTS AND COOP. IF U LIKE TO GRIND THIS GAME IS FOR YOU."
6777,Dont like :P
6778,it is just like left for dead just call it left foor dead 3  bad
6779,"This game is 'OP', in two ways.

Overpriced - The microtransactions are 'Too Expensive' and they are a 'Rip-Off'.
Overpowered - The microtransactions makes the game 'Unbalanced' and 'Unfair'."
6780,mans this game is realyl god if u even have friend play xDDDDD becuz this game cn be vry HARD WOW bat when we kill ur cscharacters and rek ppl we 2 god man b4tt tehn we luse and we rek xDDDDD k? b
6781,"Love The Game Been Here Since Release, The Game Does Have Problems And Stuff But Its A Fun Game To Play If You Wanna Have Some 'Casual' Fun like Zombies,TDM,Zombie Scenario ETC. And I Love The Game Because Nexon Don't Just FORCE You To Buy Decoders To git gud Or To Have Fun And That's Why I Still Love The Game. The Developers Also Give 100% Free Decoders And Weapons From Time To Time And Because Of That I Have Gotten Some Mad Guns Such As : Divine Lock,Savery,Brick PieceV2,Slasher,Eruptor,Ak47Dragon,Usas12Camo,Victory Canada,Golden SL8 And Other Things Like Dominique And Blair. So In My Probably Stupid Review People That Say ""OMFG THIS GAME IS SO P2W FUCK THIS SHIT GAME""  I Say Don't Judge A Book By It's Cover But By It's Quality(Maybye).  P.S OH And I Almost Forgot Pls Add A Mode Where You Can Play The OLD Zombie Shelter Where You Have The Machine Gun Thing."
6782,Terrible. Just terrible.
6783,"Great way to pass the time while saving up for better source games like CSGO and HalfLife 2. Wouldn't recommend unless you have a couple compitent friends that play. Not too many players know english/and/or are little kids who used their parents credit card on the game. Overall decent entry to the counterstrike experience with the free 1.6 clone, almost felt like I went back in time.

[h1]Pros[/h1]

[*]Free 1.6
[*]Easy to master against unskilled players
[*]Many fun gamemodes to waste your time in trying to explore
[*]Solid community still standing though on it's last few hits till it's gone

[h1]Cons[/h1]

[*]P2W Items in game
[*]Crafting is like the lottery no matter how good the grade is
[*]No one has a mic
[*]If they do have a mic, foreign or little kid telling you he did your mom (See Xbox Live)
[*]Steeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep learning curve for non-clone gametypes
[*]Servers are run on the new age boxes of potatoes
[*]Always someone in the game who makes the other team win, no matter which side you're on (usualy with P2W items)

[h1]Overall recommendation[/h1]

[b]NOT WORTH IT UNLESS YOU HAVE DISPOSABLE MONEY/TRANSLATOR[/b]"
6784,terrible
6785,"Boots up, btw i got a 10$ starter kit or whatever.
I played for 60 hours.

6786,Good remake of popular Counter Strike 1.6
6787,"Is Perfect Game FPS for me Goo For New Events,Maps And ETC. ;)"
6788,"Crash every 5min and that is pathetic for game engine 15+ years old. FIX game !
A lot of people use ""old"" cs hacks  aim and wh and nobody ban them from servers.
Technical support is joke.
Game can be fun but it needs a lot of improvements and control over the players."
6789,Awesome game :D
6790,"When you're VAC banned on CSGO

enjoying my VACation so far"
6791,Terrible game
6792,basically a free version of the original counter strike but way way worse.
6793,This is a decent game all around. i personally dont care for the zombies but if you want to play cs and you dont want to pay for it this is a great alternative

For The Game Mode You Want To Play, You Can Still Play
The Game Will Add AI Bots
Dont Hesitate, Play It Today, Or Tomorrow, Or The Next Day 
What Are You Waiting For? Come On, You Know You Wanna Check The Game Out"
6800,"There Is A Classic Mode That Is Just Like Good Ol 1.6, This Game Was How I Started Since I Didn't Have Any Money. If You Are Just Starting Steam And You Are Broke Just As I Was Then This Is A Good Game To Introduce You To CS... Just Don't Play Zombie Mode... It Sucks"
6801,sexy game
6802,How do you change the map?
6803,I would not recommend when game was released it was fun and wasn't bad but now there are too many changes to the game and it is not as fun as it used to be due to all the changes
6804,amazing game hard to get use to it and become good but when you get the handle of it waw is this game fun

6842,its bad
6843,"No way I can give this game a good review in any circumstances.
No way I can give this game any sort of chance.
They only did worse by the time goes, not only talking about weapons, but about everything, I mean EVERY SINGLE aspect of this game has been made worse, or actually it has been born like this never seen CSO in any of its patches ever to be good and appealing, please remove this game there is no purpose to keep it on steam store page.

Also GM called me a tool."
6844,Its a good game
6845,asdfg
6846,"Brings back memories of Counter Strike 1.6 but with more weapons. Great game, would recommend."
6847,"gonna put it out for you . its a cashgrab , you see faggots runnin round killin everyone just because they have the most op piece of shit gun . just pass up on it save money and buy cs go , dont be a retard , think smart ."
6848,cool
6849,crashes sometimes but still is is great multi player game with action co-op and more
6850,Bad game.
6851,Big fan of counter-strike but this is horrible. The reason i hate it is because when you're a zombie it is almost impossible to win because when shot you can't move plus the weapons have poor accuracy no matter what.Don't waste your time with this one!
6852,"Hahahahahahahhahahahahaahahahahahahahahahhahaha

-Install Game
-Played it
-""Wow this game is cool!""
-Buying a DLC Packet for 20$
-Starting game again
-Suddenly i cant play it anymore coz of errors of Steam
-Sitting in front of the computer after several attempts of fixing the errors
-Looking at the error
-Thought about the 20$ i just spent for nothing
-Becoming Laughflash and rape my laptop and threw it around my room."
6853,Very good game

6861,"I can't start the game. it says ""this game requires Steam, but i already have Steam Installed though. can you update the game so that doesn't do that problem?"
6862,dont waste 50 mins pn downloading
6863,NO NO NO NO. NOOOOOOOOO.
6864,"""This game requires steam"".....DUDE WTF I DOWNLOADED IT AND RAN IT ON STEAM!!!!!"
6865,"This is a free to play counter strike game, with zombies added, you can get really cool guns and characters most of you do have to pay for characters, weapon crafting and other things are a little wierd at first, but you'll get used to it."
6866,"I love this game, the zombie aspect is pretty good and the stages are amazing, I just wish there wasn't expire dates on guns."
6867,Kys.
6868,This game is trash
6869,WORST FUCKING GAME EVER
6870,"Though its more foccused on the zombie mode, i feel that it its still counter strike it feels fine. Though the game has alot of guns, dlc and random cosmedics, the multiplayer mode is just like the clasic CS. Many people hate this game but i think its ok."
6871,"NICE!!!
"
6872,If you're looking for counter strike clone that is free then you'll definitely love this game! Gives you free items and gear on login and is quite balanced and not P2W.
6873,didnt like the flow of the game
6874,this game is awsome and fun great players as well
6875,"I liked this game for awhile, a loot based game (my favorite), and there was a variety of gamemodes to try out, and plenty of people to meet. I knew that Counter Strike: Global Offensive was kind of based around buying everything if you actually wanted to go pro, and I was somewhat good at this game, so I wanted to do that. Then I realized, that it would cost a LOT of money if you wanted to do good. The chances of actually getting good weapons was so low, and in order to upgrade weapons, you had to get lucky to get the upgrade you wanted, and you had to use upgrade parts that you BUY, not can earn normally. I also don't mind the time based system, but the blueprints are AWFULLY hard to get, considering to get S grade ones was quite hard, and it really wasn't worth it to waste a 72-Permanent thing on something that isn't garunteed. Also, I found that it was kind of hard for me to focus on the zombie part of the game, when most of the items that I was recieving was coming from the multiplayer (team deathmatch) part of the game."
6876,"Well, lets get this straight.
If youre looking for a good free version of cs, youre gonna be dissapointed.
But if youre looking for a game that has a lego assault rifle which you can rebuild into a choo-choo train rocket launcher, you've come to the right place. This is a very ""Japanese"" game with some very insane weapons. The gameplay is fun and feels just like cs, looks like cs 1.6 (which can be a pro or a con depending on your taste) and it just stupid fun. It isnt really p2w, but there are p2w elements in it.

tl;dr: u want free cs u get no free cs but u get zomby"
6877,I want to know if this is my computer or it's a problem but every time i try to start it up it says i need steam but I am clicking play on my libary and right now im just confused
6878,best game 2016
6879,"it's a waste of time, as the game is boring, looks terriable and it's impossiable to figure out how to play it with your friends."
6880,"/ Is just my opnion about it!
I don t feel like I play cs, but the game has a unique gameplay.
Pros:
A lot of weapons
The original guns are free
Events
Old maps
FREE!
Cons:
A little bit p2w
Humans are 2 overpowerd
Some guns can t be unlocked by free players
Sometimes is boring


I give it a solid 7.5/10 
Give it a try."
6881,"This game like - BOIIIII!!!!!!! , COME ON BUY SOME DECODERS , I THINK U WANT( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) and....

6885,Holy shit this is a PERFECT GAME!
6886,"So yesterday i got back to this game i enjoyed some matches
But then i came at a point were you just think ""these are all bots"" so you come to realize that this game is dying from the players base

-*So you come to question, do you really want to grind a battle pass when the game is dying?*

We know it's a pretty good game but that was only when i had a very bad graphic card.
-Hopefully they will work on a huge graphics update right away,
Because it's not from this time anymore
-There is another follow up from this game called counter strike: online 2^ but i didn't enjoy that follow up as much

-i still like the character designs you don't see these in another sort of game.
-the shooting in this game is way differently than cs:go, people will not get used to this right away, and maybe dislike the game for this simple fact."
6887,Wont start...
6888,bad game
6889,"preety good but not much pepole play certain things
"
6890,"okay so this is a review on counter strike nexon zombies 

susscesful criteria

the game is quit good and i enjoy playing it
the best side is humans and my favrote gun is the awp or aug i like that you can customize your gun and charecter 

downfalls

the only downfalls are that when i try and record using built in recorder it laggs and glitches and gameplay is slow the other thing is not personal but why do they use standerd and original xcounter strike maps
why not mke a set of maps for this specific game 

other than that it is a realy greta team game that builds team work akills and freindshipn 

i would rate it a 13 and up becouse it is a bit loud

6891,I love the Survival mode and the Multiplayer with Bots tbh.
6892,GG! Good Job!
6893,"I like this game, its very fun if you are playing with friends, you can play the classic CS, but this is more fun playing with zombies and with friends, if you are looking for a competitive game, this is not one, but if you are looking for a game to have fun with your friends, i 100% recommend this game!"
6894,awful
6895,"heyyyyyy, that's pretty good!"
6896,"""It isnt a counter stike game, just a very cheaply made zombie game that uses the name ""counter strike"" for more views.

6919,You're better off throwing a deck of cards out the window and picking them up. This game is garbage.
6920,"Oh wait this is Counter-Strike?

I thought i was playing the early alpha version of Left 4 Dead."
6921,To Be Honest its not a bad game. I just dont like that its pay to win but can be fun wither you pay or not if u are a fan of source then u wil like this :)
6922,"This game is aways running for me and isn't a very good game to download in the first place, gameplay isn't any good and runs terribly."
6923,i cant afford csgo so i got this
6924,:)
6925,I started the game then it said the game requires steam which it is confussing in the fact that i did used steam. Probably I didn't or something else
6926,I ACTUALLY PLAYED THIS FOR MORE THAN A MINUTE?!?!
6927,amazing
6928,"great for the price it is
edit: wait wtf why is it minecraft now this isnt counterstrike help"
6929,became p2w kappa
6930,"This game is the most philisophical and thought provoking game of our age. It's deep allegorical nature will leave you pondering your own life. It is a perfect reflection of our mundane day to day lives as ordinary humans. 

You see the levels in this game are meant to symbolize life in the way that they are long, arduous, confusing, and pretty much look the same the whole way through. 

The zombies, a horrible plague of undending monsters spewing out from all directions and all angles, they represent out insecurities constantly follwing us and attacking us sometimes trapping us and preventing progression. 

The guns you use to mow down the endless waves of zombies represent hope and self-confidence as they are the tools you use to destroy your insecurities gaining the ability to push through life, 

The other players in the game all mindlessly running around as well trying to their own thing and figure out what's going, they represent society. As you stumble your way through broken and confused harassed by your insecurities you see other people stumbling through as well. You look at them and think ""What are they doing? Are they stupid? Maybe they have the right idea, what am I doing? Am I stupid? Should I do what they're doing? What's going on?"" 

The goal of the game is to try and figure out how to progress through the level while killing as many zombies as possible. While the goal of life is to try and figure out how to progress and achieve your dreams while fighting off your doubts and insecurities. The game shows that with some hope, some help, and a little bit of stumbling around that anything is possible."
6931,Just don't
6932,One of the Best Zombie Games ever made.. ( By Valve..! ) XP :D
6933,"Doesn't even start. ""This game requires Steam.""

What a waste of bandwidth."
6934,PFFF!
6935,Great game
6936,When you're to poor to buy CSS and include microtransactions
6937,"This Game has Glitching disappearing Hud!!! PLEASE, HELP I DON'T LIKE THIS GAME!!!

EDIT: I am now changing this to a yes now because I love the game, it does not have a glitching hud either anymore.

EDIT2 May 23, 2020: I am giving this a no just because at the time, this was the only free CS game made by valve in the US (not counting CSO 1 and 2). Just play CS:GO, the game was fun while it lasted but CS:NZ or CS:NS (idk why they changed the title) are pretty irrelevant. Now playing it is fun, its just I prefer CS:GO"
6938,"yo that game is good

"
6953,"i need help Please .. i cant Play 

 i have pro pc 
i have good ping

"
6954,"If you have CS:GO then your better off playing that game exept if you like zombies, killing Zombies, Running away from Zombies ect... there is an offline mode of zombies and also offline mode of casual cs:go stuff... i would recomend this game as it has so many maps and the grafics is like in 1.6. Sometimes the servers are glichy and very laggy but all you have to do is leave your game and go on a diffrent one... as there are over 200 servers or you can make your own server and play with a password with friends..."
6955,pay to win
6956,its training for Cs Go!
6957,Shit
6958,"when a skin gives you more bullets or makes it shoot fucking rockets, i fucking love the game."

6964,Meh. First day delete.
6965,This is bullshit. $2.00 For nothing. dosn't even turn on. fuck this to earths atmosphere!
6966,Bad graphics. But it will be fun to people who like classics.
6967,Good fun for a free game. Running from zombies in Helms deep feeling like Legolas is a real thrill :)
6968,GOOD GAME I LOVE COUNTER STRIIKE
6969,CA:Z YESSSSSSssss
6970,"it good game it fun good gun but the graphic
"
6971,It is a fairly good game but there are some problems like I'll join a game and I can't keep up becuase the players already have some over-powered weapon. Also the zombies could be a little easier everytime I join a game I have some trouble killing them.
6972,"this game is shit for only one reason... it takes an HOUR to load so I dont even know what the game is like cause once It loaded my computer crashed and I did this 6 TIMES, 6 GODDAMN TIMES, NO THIS GAME IS A STAIN ON THE GAMING COMMUNITY. FUCK YOU NEXON AND FUCK YOU NEXON EUROPE GMBH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
6973,Worst Game ever.

6975,"This game sucks ass i have played for not even an hour and it's boring already
just play csgo"
6976,"Nice game,i like :)"
6977,"really nice game but it hard to get the guns u want
not that u cant get gun that r good


was my previous review. don't play this trash heap of a korean shit game. at first it was not that bad but they kept transforming it by adding a lot of power creep unnecessary items and always insane op weapons just to get you spending. it became like one of those cancerous cs 1.6 servers with all the trashy affect except worse since at least some of them are balanced.
the team that used to work on this changed a long time ago and that's where stuff started to slowly go out of hand. they were already are and it went to a free fall with the new team that i suspect just listens to what their marketers tell them. PS the western version is always behind in updates to the pan-Asian version but at this point that is a plus to be honest. maybe it is because the Asian fans like it like this they thought we would too? doubt it even then still dumb to do. save your  self your time and oh yea don't think i need to mention but this game is a INSANE P2W and not any p2w but literally spend close to 1000$ - 1300$ to get almost all the good things in this game unless you are not lucky because yep lootbox system. all in a 1.6 fucking server disguised as a game. i mean it is literally 1.6 texture and gameplay with these items they have and if you are new good luck figuring out how to play the game as i pry for your poor soul and no youtube wont help you unless you speak a couple Pan-Asian languages that's IF you find a youtuber who even speaks at all."
6978,"You can aquire rare and awesome weapons, also, i really like that the base game is cs 1.6. You basically get to play 1.6 for free, what isn't there to like? 11/10
"
6979,"/Positives: 
Counter Strike 1.6 modes included.
Custom player models.
Somewhat enjoyable PvE horde/objective mode.
Good controls.
TDM.
A few new game modes/maps.
/Negatives:
Poor graphics.
Lag issues.
Microtransactions.
Bland enemy design.
Poor level design.
Crummy player base.

All in all, it's got flaws. The new modes are interesting and entertaining in small bursts, but even if you don't like them, it's basically a free Steam-based install of 1.6. Can't really go wrong there. So don't expect a masterpiece, but don't pass it up without at least trying it."
6980,play ya its decent you hit couple hours learn ropes rage quit join back and then you love it get good and rage and quit and repeat
6981,"ok
"
6982,"Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is a free to play MMO shooter game from Korea that is ported officially from old Counter Strike game, then they added a zombie mode, free to play model and crafting.  It worked, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok, was understandable.   Has NA, EU, Asian servers.  You can play original counter strike or team deathmatch vs zombies.  Has a lot of stuff giveaways.

CONS: The UI was rather cluttered and the graphics retro, gameplay will be laggy, the code buggy.

Try it, maybe if you like pvp shooter games.

6985,"In this game i literally only like the zombies game modes, that's pretty much it! I wouldn't really play this game for pvp or tdm. But overall since the zombie modes are fun i'd give this game like 7/10 but if it had really close similarities to counter strike, might've been 9/10 for me. But the pvp is glitchy but the zombies game modes a hella fun! Be sure to play with your friends, it's more better if you play with your friends than youself.!!"
6986,dumb
6987,I mean...if you like s*** then its alright...ish.
6988,"After playing this game for some time, I realized how bad this game actually is.

-There are loads of overpowered weapons that can only be obtained through so called ""decoders"", the worst offender being a very annoying laser pistol which every noob seems to use in DM.
-Speaking of decoders, they used to drop after every mission you do in the game, giving any player a chance to get cool stuff, now you have to do some random crap in order to even get one.
-Zombie PvP is generally unfair; team balance is non-existent and there are some powerups which can kill a big ass zombie with thousands of health in TWO HITS.
-Cheaters.
-There is a mode called Gun Deathmatch, which is basically CSGO's Arms Race, but with awful weapons. How am I expected to kill someone with a goddamn tiny slingshot?!?
-""Are you tired of playing as the same old CS 1.6 terrorists? Now you can play as a female! What's that? You don't have 7 dollars to pay? Well screw you!""
-The in-game reporting tool seems to be completely useless.
-Oh, a survey opens in Internet Explorer after I exit the game? No thanks.
-Did I mention cheaters?

I could say its like stand alone of this server but much much better version with more new weapons zombies cosmetics and others. I really would say that its lot of fun with your friends if you like co-op, pvp, pve, itp... This game is perfect for you."
7011,no
7012,it kicks me out of the game no reson

7027,So far i like this game but i just reallysuck balls at the game lol i recommend it
7028,"This is the fucking amzing game of the year 2015! :D
"
7029,";)

7030,k
7031,"I have been playing Counter Strike: Condition Zero since 2004 (a few months after release) using the GoldSrc Engine. 

I really like the game and what they did to revamp a condizion zero - like game. Still keeping the good graphics from what it was when Cs originally Started in 2000, but making it a bit better with the gun system and different styles and looks of different guns. 

I also myself, am a zombie slaying addict and adore the zombie modes they have in store as well as different normal modes.

Yes i agree it is a bit of a Pay To Win, but you can still outskill people with the standard guns.

Anyway, Here are my Pros and Cons.

Pros:

- Great feel and gameplay , just like old Cs
-Good weapon system, and daily login rewards (same guns but you get them for free for a day - few days)
-Good zombie and normal modes with different maps to play on!
-Different, and cool weapons you get from crafting or decoders!

Cons:

-Alot of people do pay on this game (from having alot of nicer weapons, i have spent a little money on this game to make this an honest review.) But fortunatley you dont really need nicer guns for pvp (like classic or deathmatch, team deathmatch etc.) Thats just based on skill, really.

-Not as many english speakers anymore on the N. American servers like when the game released in 2014. But still fun to shoot and kill or rack up zombies and farm.

Well, that wraps up my review. Overall i very highly recommend this game.


"
7032,Don't waste your precious life on this game.
7033,its fun with lots of gamemodes
7034,i cant play....so i cant say much
7035,Whis is cool game!!!!!!
7036,all around good game
7037,it good
7038,Eh..
7039,Please no
7040,"This game is cancer for yout eyes. A browser shooter literally has better graphics, not a game that starts off as a browser then a screen, like roblox or some other ftp games. Like the browser shooters on miniclip. Those. Those have better graphics. And the lag. I play with an 80 ping, which is ok, a little laggy, but playable on most games with good servers. When i play this game, i feel like i have a ping mid 150s which is not very good, and not playable. The game has horrible graphics, terrible servers, and the pay to win is extreme. I had lag while playing with bots, not low fps, but actual lag, like stutter lag, but hey, at least you didnt waste money, just wasted some internt slowing down while you coulve watched netflix."
7041,adadas
7042,"P2W, sorry."
7043,People with addictive personalities that fall under the f2p/p2w category need to know that yes you can earn weapons but its easier to buy them so please be warned that if you tend to get dragged into that type of thing it is a fun game but its definitely a pay 2 win game.
7044,bad graphics
7045,hardest zombie scenario simulator 2016
7046,didn't let me fondle anyone
7047,"probably one of the worst games i ever played.
the graphics are those of CS 1.6 with as minimal optimization as possible.
but graphics's aren't anything right?
ever thought that CS needed pay2win,crafting and iron sights?
no? well this game gives it to you anyway! 
yes you may be able to get every weapon without paying real money,
but just like every other free2play game it takes fucking ages.

the maps are some official CS maps and some that didn't got released in the offical games...for a reason.
those specific maps weren't picked for the offical games because there map design was just bad.
But this game is created by Nexon right? who gives a shit about map design at Nexon?
i mean they created Combat Arms and Warrock,they don't know shit about designing Shooter games which is shown very well in these two ""games"".
the game modes are okay,there is a good selection of gamemodes but many aren't well made or thought through.
to any aspiring Shooter game designer : shooting 50k HP walls isn't fun. shooting a helicopter for 2 hours isn't fun either.

this game is an insult to the whole franchise. 
you know the old times in games like CS:S where you just bought the deagle and killed everyone?
WELL IN THIS GREAT GAME YOU NEED TO BUY AMMO FOR YOUR GUN!
because...CS totally needed that,yeah. 

""Oh you don't know anything about this game you just played it for an hour,the game get's better the longer you play it.""
yeah that's not how games should work you know? especially not Free 2 Play games that are made with a casual focus.
Casual means that i can jump straight into game,know what to do and have fun,not that i need to craft guns.
i get it,it's free 2 play they need to pay the servers somehow,but 10‚Ç¨ for 1 Character is...more then a little overprized.

Nexon should finally move away from the Shooter Genre,all games they made or published are just terrible.
this is no exception,stay away from it as far as possible.
if you disagree with anything i've said here feel free to comment and i will correct the review.
oooor just dislike,comment kys and fuck off,your decision.

Save up for CSGO or CS:S if your PC sucks and i will 100% guarantee you that you will have more fun with one of those games. and your gonna find a small loan of a million dollars under your pillow tomorrow 100% no scam pls like dis review kappa."
7048,"zdr

7049,"Played it for about 5 minutes.. keeps opening internet explorer, which i dont use.


Bloody Shite"
7050,"The hate for this game just seems very unnecessary. It's just a free to play version of Counter Strike 1.6 with slightly improved graphics and more game modes. If you hate all the extra weapons that are OP, just play classic and it a free CS game. Recommend to people who haven't play cs but want to (stick to classic and tdm for it to be more like cs.)

Edit: A person told me more about the game and here is what they said
ZeroHoots 38 minutes ago  
classic weapons? sure! but how about the models? all those sexist using female skins.. i have nothing against it but god damn they are skinny af. again this has nothing to do with 1.6 or any other counter-strike games. if you look into the original CS,are there any females? NO! and if there was any they wouldn't be that fukin skinny af. nexon is sexist! and they do made a fun game YES but goddamn they ruined it with pay to win. REALLY nice job nexon. i have 600 hours into this game and i can tell you nexon is a piece of a garbage company that is trying to suck your wallet dry. thats why this game will never have positivity and will always have negative reviews. (Drops mic)"
7051,it was good
7052,eh its ok
7053,Its really bad no fun at all
7054,"Ur game is shit, no full screen, shit graphics."
7055,"-10/10 worst game ever... I just looked and saw that you can buy dlc... F*** this s*** why? 
Ps: Don't waste money or time on this"
7056,"It's is fun and addictive

not for people who want good graphics."
7057,aiming became an option not a must :#
7058,wtf is this cancer
7059,"PROS:
Eh... Its Counter Strike?
Combat is... thrilling, to say the least.
But I guess PVP is pretty ok

CONS:
Zombies - Its doesn't fit the Counter Strike vibes.
Zombies look worse than player models
Money... money money money money to get anywhere in the game

6/10
Eh."

7061,No.
7062,"This game is not Counter-Strike. I mean, it has the basis of Counter-Strike, you can even play classic Counter-Strike game modes on classic maps and only-classic weapons, but is is no more than 5% of this game.

Many people say this game is pay2win. Yes, it is. And it would be bad for a competitive game - but it is not. This game is pure fun: monumental amount of game modes, from deathmatches and zombies to survival and even horror modes, ridiculous weapons with deep crafting and upgrading systems, and recently - studio mode, where you can create your own maps! How cool is that?

As a Counter-Strike, I would not recommend playing this game. Why would you when CS:GO is free-to-play? However, as a fun FPS for you and your friends, it is an amazing game that still gets updated."
7063,"First of all, its way too confusing. Theres loads of pop ups and words but the gameplay is just like Counter Strike 1.6. So its a maybe for this game. But its FREE! ;)"
7064,"Everyone would think ""Yeah, another CS 1.6 copy or something like that...""
Well, this one is a bit more than that. It's improved!
Zombie mode: More fun
Gungame: More fun
Scenario: NEW STUFF YOU NEVER FOUND IN CS!!!
Besides that you have the good old DM/TDM/CLASSIC game modes.
I think it's a bit like CrossFire with CS engine.
Give it a shot, you won't regret...I played this for about 100 hours on my other account."
7065,It has a good deathmatch. For players who want counter strike GO play this its ALMOST the same.
7066,"It won't let me play it because the game says that CS:NZ is already running. I tried to do what the help told me to do, but it didn't work."
7067,I like this cause it has many easter eggs
7068,this games is awsome because you have a lot of game mods and a lot of weapons but it dont have the best graphics are not that good and this is why i dont like at this game but the rest of the game is awsome i like it very much and i recommend it
7069,"Those writing bad reviews don't know how the game works. True it takes some getting used to. This is not a pay to win game. In fact the way the store is set up it is more a pay to lose your money. You only get more chances to randomly get a weapon. It will not simply give you a weapn you want.

Second the weapons are well balanced, though there are some weapons that really suck. If some one uses a laser gun, it is still well balanced just a bit cooler that the rest. An mk47 will still work well against a laser.

The game has a great reward system. It takes a while to get many of the rewards. Its a play to win game. The more you play the greater the rewards. I have played the game for over 700hrs and support this game. I would gladly reccomend this game to my friends, and have done so.

I wish the negative reviewers would get to know the game better before writing a review. The game has many players in it allready but it would be nice to see more players. And of course starting out your going to suck at first  if you have'nt played counter strike before.

As for the graphics, valve did make a counter strike with better graphics, can't remember the name of it cause I only played it a few hours. The better graphics were there but it wasn't any fun to play. So what about the graphics. I can actually play this game on a netbook. That gives the game so much more playability than a well polished good looking high graphics game.  If you still don't like the game due to graphics, I suggest you just go and play one without leaving a negative review just because it doesn't look like todays games.
"
7070,"All ive seen strictly for this game is negativity, people now'adays only play for the graphics and could care less about game play, if you want care about game play over graphics give this one a try. Its pretty fun for the most part minus the constant adverts to buy their guns and etc with real cash"
7071,Very Nice game i love it very much
7072,"I wish I could give a neutral review, becuase honestly this game isn't ~bad~. It's lack luster. It's a nexon game. It's got mmo material grinding or you buy gear for real life cash. It has nonpermanent weapons and the chance to get flashy permanents through mileage tickets and stuff like that. It's like opening capsules in S4League, if anybody still remembers that game. The zombies are interesting but the gameplay starts getting boring when all you have is starter gear and everyone else fucks it up in a matter of seconds. Although the infected game mode is pretty balanced in terms of normal gear vs pay to win gear. Honestly this game isn't bad, but it isn't that good either."
7073,"i am HOOKED on this game you can bhop if ye want is to fun XD
"
7074,Fun game and easy to play multi payer with friends i rate this 100%
7075,"Game addicting at begining, but after a couple of hours it getting borring, nothing new happens, poor graphics and bad menu design. No crafting and enchanting tutorials, and also in this game you can get lvl and best weapons by paying real money, it says that if you want have full poential you must P2P to be good or spend weeks to get realy good weapon."
7076,"For a counter-strike game, it should be better, but it's pretty mediocre"
7077,"It's made by Nexon, of course it's P2W. To actually be able to play, you have to pay money. Instead of using your money on this piece of garbage, buy CS:GO. It's simple."
7078,no
7079,its a very good game you all shuld get it plus its free
7080,"This game is fun for people who want to mess around with friends for a few hours a week blowing up zombies, and for people obsessed with weapon purchases, loterry, chaces to get new weapons, etc. The main menu it's a mess to me, but I know that's just me looking for bad things. Imagine grabbing the first Counter Strike engine then putting a bunch of made up gamemodes that people will endlessly play shooting their way out of a sea of zombies. Perhaps the best gamemodes are the one where you try to put up a story, advancing though the longest of hallways till you beat up a boss, and the one where you get to build a fortress to protect your team of up to 4 pals from against zombies at night.

Overall, play this game is good, but it depends too much on those who are obsessed with getting good weapons and experience points. It would be nice to be able to get name changed, perhaps work around some way to show the Steam name? Just asking.

Good game, would play again to mess with a friend or two."
7081,it works on a laptop okay if that says anything
7082,"it's like a free counter strike! 
great for poor people and/or children!"
7083,This game is alright I don't play it daily. but if you ever wanted a free Counter-Strike Game then you should pick this up.
7084,"The worst game I have ever seen. Bugged out two computers that I used that were mine and couldn't get them fixed. DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!!!!


0/10 would not download again"

7087,"you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients
- To Make the Dough
375 grams (3 cups) plain flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup (50 ml / 3¬Ω tablespoons) olive oil
1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water
Extra flour for dusting 


- To Make Cheese Filling
15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese
5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)
Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper


- Extras
Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)
Parmesan cheese
Basil
Fried vegetables
Shrimp
Fish slices
Chicken pieces 
Make the Ravioli filling.

- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.
- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.
- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

Make the Ravioli dough.

- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.
- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.
- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.
- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.
- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.
- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).
- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn‚Äôt suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. 

Fill the Ravioli shells.

- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.
- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.
- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù touch as well.
- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.
- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. 

Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.

- Roll the dough into two sheets
- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.
- Fill with the ravioli mixture.
- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.
- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.

Cook the Ravioli.

- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.
- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.
- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest 
- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates

Serve it up.
Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

7105,"E uma mistura de CS 1.6 com o Layout do Point Blank. N√£o gostei, Pela repercu√ßao do game, achei que era algo inovador. Mas so perdi meu tempo instalando. Nota 5/10.

7106,"People say, its a pay to win.
And its not really, i played this game, like 1 month, and when some budy invites you to wis family [CLAN].
You just go the the storage of the family and there will be alout of guns so you can take what ever u want!!!
And you can get stuff by doing the bingo, and getting random guns!!!
"
7107,ive played this alot with friends and this game is fun not with one person but with a few its a good time worth a try!
7108,"I recommend this game, sorta. It's graphics are bad, but nostalgic if you are a 1.6 or Source player, but the zombie mode is very boring and sorta bad. However the bot mode is very fun if you do Bomb Defusal, 16v16 with friendly fire on. It's a clusterfuck of guessing who the enemy is! 3/10 Very enjoyable at some times, but online is so bad."
7109,"Game is good but not Perfect Thats All I can say but the hell about the game its Counter-Strike and its for free yaaaay.
If you are broke got no money for Counter Strike and this is your game."
7110,"
It's a great game with different mods. Its Cool to play with friends in the game"
7111,the new update made this game amazing
7112,"It was good in 2009 when it was called CS Online, now it's garbage.
+60 hours later- it still sucks, im just wasting my time"
7113,Best game ever!
7114,best free csgo and i would highly recommend it even at a low end pc csgo is the top of my list and 60 fps thanks for this nexon as well as no hacks because of security love it :):):):):)
7115,"Im just going to cover the zombie pvp modes because thats what I mainly play.

Zombie pvp modes were fine up until about 4-5 months ago until they decided to add Dna perks and allow you to upgrade to lvl 3. You're probably wondering what zombie Dna perks are. Well, basically you can use up to 9 of the 20 available most of which just increase your HP and armor, but one in particular really ruins zombie pvp modes that being on-hit-boost. This perk basically resets zombie abilities at a low chance. Not a very low chance if you ask me because i've used zombies with healing abilities and had it reset 6-7 times in a row healing thousands of hp in seconds and then infecting everyone.

Now besides Nexon making zombies even more powerful most rooms are just FULL of people using light zombies and sting fingers. Basically they're really mobile skinny bitches that have broken hitboxes that most people love to use with bhop macros such as autohotkey making them almost impossible to hit.

One final thing I want to cover with zombie pvp modes is what I like to call ""Lag abusers"" these are people that usually live in brazil or russia with dialup internet having 200+ ping and they teleport lag around the map infecting players from 2-4x the normal distance. Sometimes they even ignore knockback and stun from weapons.

With all of that said the only other thing I want to mention is the decoders. Now while I don't think this game is pay to win anymore due to zombies being extremely overpowered now if you actually want weapon variety be prepared to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars. The chances for some cool weapons such as the warhammer, reaper, etc are low like a 1 / 600 chance and with decoders being $5 a piece you can see how stupid that is. At least in CSO which is the eastern version of this game they pay $0.80 - $1.50 for a premium type decoder."

7123,its a good game not any good graphics its srsly un fair thoue cause u get *CUSTOM WEPONS* like the cyclone which shoots  a beam at you and then kills you in a good 5 secs and the storyline is just rly stupid dosent make sense at all oh and the zombies rly over powerd but u find these places were the zombies cant reach you *mostly due to the guns firing at them specficly the custom ones* cause your camping for a good 3/4 of a round and then u run around cause the zombies figerd out a way to get up in your camping area and most of the games i play is just zombies thier is Team Death Match which is good tons of players usaly from other countries mostly russia as for the maps you play in it ummm how can i put this Dust 2 huge advatge for the terrioste none for the counter guys and thats mostly cause of the custom stuff they have specficly the guns they just spawn camp as for the other maps thier fair but dust 2 is the most played and for the other maps that are more amazing than dust 2 have been ignored but other than that good game not good graphics i gusse its Quanity over quality *due to the fact that 3rd world peeps play this the most cant blame them* but its reptive and the missions are ridcules u need a good 6 guys just to beat it  so ya thats meh review
7124,"Runs like garbage, looks like garbage. Avoid if you can."
7125,WHY does this game exist?
7126,"God, this game is awful. I'd rather eat the rotten asshole of a roadkill skunk then play this game."
7127,I cant even play because of xingcode error. This game is so wack.
7128,great job with the game is kind of fun game i like gun game mode is my favourite
7129,it sux m8
7130,"Good things: 
* Free to Play (but also pay to win)
* Over 25 Different Gamemodes and counting...
* Any PC can play this, considering it's based off a game that came out in 1999
* Never run out of things / quests / missions / etc.
* Great for nostalgic players of CS 1.6 and so on

Bad things:
* In 2019, not as many players are playing CSNZ so finding a specific country / server to best suite your ping is difficult
* Most pay to win games i've ever played
* Terrible customer support"
7131,when i log in the game is on when im not playing plz hep
7132,"I gotta be honest
 It took 6 guys on 1 zombie to actually kill him (including 3 seperate reloads and such, 2 light machine guns, a shotgun and assault rifles.)

 So..yeah. Talk about difficulty."
7133,I LOVE THIS GAME PLS RELEAS OTHER GAMES LIKE  THIS like more better graphigs pls thx
7134,Counter Strike Nexon Zombies is a cool game. It could be my top favorite if  it beats black ops 2 and 3
7135,"just dont think about get this thing

7138,Terrible.
7139,"I really enjoyed this game untill this antivirus came out of nowhere and kicked me and my friends for no reason whatsoever. We were having a lot of fun and then this came up Detected by....
Seriously pay2win? Wtf?!?
Well I uninstalled it and have moved on. This game had potential but it didn't deliver the goods. Zombies were stupid, broken antivirus and pay2win.
Not recommended!"
7140,"This game is absolute shit. No tutorial, so you go into the menu confused as hell, and when you finally get into a game you have no fucking clue what to do. Also the grapics suck. The game has no point. Very slow and buggy."
7141,It's okay
7142,Its an alright game
7143,YES YES YES IGRA GODA PROST SHEDEVEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111!!!!111
7144,Lot of weapons. and not p2w
7145,"A really fun counter-strike game, and better, it's free!"
7146,"Yes. this might be a copy of Counter strike original but only 1 thing. I think its better overall because there is more weapons, fair matches and its free! Yea it might not be like the original game, but it has its ups and downs and i think this is a great game and i recommend for people who cant afford the normal games!"
7147,"Its free...
And fun..."
7148,"This game is amazing, please add full controller support."
7149,The trailer was great but the gameplay wasn't the best.
7150,this game has no contoler support so i was unable to play it
7151,"it's ok 
The game is fun. I always felt left out when my friends played  CSGO. Everytime I watch them broadcast it online. But now I found this game even though it's not onpar with CSGO it's still fun. I highly recommend downloading this game."
7152,"Just take a look on how many hours i speend on this game also if you want i invite you to see all weapons that i bought across all my years there since 2015, 
this isnt a joke.
  i was permanently banned for a joke. literally i type a joke on the public chat about selling my 1million of miellage. then after that i leave the game for a month 
 so when i joined again ...guess what ? 
i  was banned forever. reason (Real money trading)     ¬° -_- !!

of course i ask for help, i beg for it ...  I sent them all the proofs they needed
waiting for their help and evry single time that i made that i always got the same answer. we cant do anything sorry you are banned.

but if there is any other thing or doubt about the game do not hesitate to contact us :3

‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì ‚Üì 
So remember guys no matter how much time do you played this or how many dollars you spend on it. everything was for nothing.... So this is how betrayal feels like

and now you cant even play the classics PVP withouth beign killed by railguns. at the end theres to much P2W so im glad that i been kicked forever i guess CSGO will be now my favorite game i recommend you to join csgo they really know how to treat a player :,3


‚Üì Solo echa un vistazo a cu√°ntas horas dedico a este juego y si quieres te invito a ver todas las armas que compr√© en todos mis a√±os all√≠ desde 2015,

7160,"Shit game, same as CrossFire mission with zombies."
7161,matando a saudade do 1.6 ^^
7162,"Okay so heres my review.

PROS: 
-Game is one of my favorite Counter Strike games other than source
-Gives you cool new guns everyday when you log in
-Easy to pick up and play forever
-Never get bored
-Great way to lose some stress in most of the maps
-Has very good community compared to CS:GO
-Easly ran on a laptop

CONS:
-If you get to sucked in you'll lose your girl/boyfriend
-It can lag sometimes but rarely 

Do I recomend this game? Yes. Yes I do. It's a great game that everyone should try even if it looks like crap at first."
7163,Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies dont work??!?!?!?!?!!?!?
7164,Poor mans CS:GO
7165,"Im a fan of the counter strike series and i enjoyed playing any of the previous counter strike games online.

I downloaded this game as i thought it would be interesting to see an official humans vs zombies counter strike.

This counter strike however has gotten a bit far fetched, with using real money to get better weapons and exclusive characters, which has made it more of a ""pay to win"" kind of game.

Just sad to see a game that was created from a mod  which was intended on playing for fun has become a game with who has the most fanciest weapon.

Overall 4/10"
7166,its free
7167,Very cool game :) + Little bugs(glitch) with buttons!
7168,"i dont know you guys seams kinad wekk like me when i get bullied
"
7169,"Not a fan of counterstrike. one of my friends recommended this to me because I like zombie games, but this is not a zombie game. the short campaign is kinda fun but everything beyond that is boring and repetitive and demands a lot of time. it's not a terrible game, but I wouldn't call it a good game either. 4/10 for me."
7170,"While the engine may be dated, its still a craptonne of fun! I highly reccomend this for a good old frag em up
"
7171,had so much fun plaing this and collecting resources xD we won on my first try and killed final boss!
7172,"Time to review the pros and cons of this game:
PROS:
-Free Counter Strike Game
-Free Game
-Free
-Game
-Only takes up 1GB RAM
-Only takes up 3 GB Hard Drive
CONS:
-Pay to Win
-You apparently craft weapons now... What the hell is this Minecraft? Are these Counter Terrorists so cheap they have to take wood and stone to make somewhat of a gun?
-The game has the same graphics as the first Counter Strike (2000) yet this is the most recent Counter Strike Game!!! This was made in 2014! I mean yeah it's free and all but have you seen No More Room in Hell? Its free but damn does it have some great graphics
-It would take you weeks to figure out the menu
-While you see enemies and teammates with laser guns, you are stuck with this crappy pistol (Pay to Win)
-Why does the game take up 3GB when it is basically the first Counter Strike but somehow crappier? 
-i'm telling you, you gotta craft weapons, and you don't get to pick your weapon. Either you get a gun, or you fail, and that is the number one way to get a damn new gun in the game (of course besides paying)
-Zombies might as well be skinless humans
-Pay money to become a woman
-Guns look like a card board cut out

OVERALL:
Might as well save up for Counter Strike Global Offensive (Trust me)
If you somehow find a way to like the game, it gets boring too quickly
You'll waste your time and space on this game, save the time of downloading it unless you want to practice for the original Counter Strike.
"
7173,you have to go into task manager to close and it always stays on even if u turn off pc. it says have played171 hours when its only like 10 minutes coz the game is sh*t. if u downloaded it you should probably KYS now!!!!!!
7174,"This game is a piece of junk. Would not recommend it. If you want a real zombie game. Go buy left 4 dead, or get unturned."
7175,"Haha, no"
7176,"This is my opninion!!!

so.

everyone is like``this games quality is not good`` alrighty its a free game what do you expect???

it is kinda pay to win game but they give you a chance to get the exact same stuff those pay to win guys get...

and ppl say that thtere are custom weapons which is to op... play the game then type... because there are different type of game modes you can fucking play...

i know i know... the zombies look shitty but as i said its a free game and they tried to make something out of it.
even tho the zombies look shit you can still have fun playing the zombie game modes right??? not like you need them to look wonderful to fap on right?

i'll give this game a 7 out of a 10.  Because obv its just a good game if you know how to play it and understand it.

its a 50-50 game. ppl may like it or not. ppl that like to play fps-shooting games i would reccoment this.

and btw i think its better then cs-go for now - FOR ME!  cuz cs-go is hella lagging even tho i have a good pc and turned the quality to very low - low in cs-go.

"
7177,"This game gave me an eargasm right off the bat, now I am deaf. so just kill me."
7178,Upon playing the game i realised that the graphics were alot worse then seen in the trailer. And another complaint is  that the gameplay is repetetive and boring.
7179,it keeps tellig me this require steam and i have it........... wtf
7180,"The Game Does Have Good Updates And Good Trailers, Though Gameplay Can Change That.


6.8 / 10"
7181,holy shit what did they DO
7182,"It's OK.
---------
Pros:
Interesting characters,weapons,modes, etc etc.
Complexity of modes, such as different zombies in ""Zombie Scenario,Hero & Mutant""

Cons:
Basically everything that includes Guy characters, the girl ass is what makes this game good.

10/10 Would plaay again for dat azz. :steamhappy:"
7183,"Honestly, it's not that bad. I don't know why people say it is.

It's kind of pay to win, I get it but the weapons aren't so overpowered that it kills you in one shot.
I love the zombies mode and also the gun game mode, and the one mode where you play as giant monsters, SO FUN!!...... and the fact that it's the style of the old counter strike reminds me A LOT of Sven Co-op which is an amazing game, recreating hl1 but multiplayer, but this is the old counter strike, but with new stuff obviously (It's different but the graphics are nostalgic)

I would give this a very solid 7.5/10
also, I recommend it if you can't buy Counter strike global offensive, or Counter strike source.

EDIT: New weapons are so op that they kill the giant zombie bosses in only 4 hits or more. I retried the game today and i'm disappointed, the game doesn't feel the same."
7184,Funny CS
7185,"revive this legendary piece of a game, it has survived through many eras let's not let it die now."
7186,nice game
7187,closest we'll get to a free counter strike game

Plus the game have very weird balancing you can get items that you ALREADY have and nexon is like DEAL WITH IT i got 500 freaking trancedence from the m4a1 dk and the ak paladian event and they gave me few blue prints that i got with shitty weapons that i already have i thought every 200 trancs piece is a premium piece from decoders and only things i got is shitty weapons..the game doesnt EVEN have a friends system or a party system wich players or friends can play with each other  PLUS the charcters are too expensive and their buff is only with scenario mode those are in my personal opinion are the reason why people hate this game or leaving it 
like a player that have played the game for 1 year can get beaten easily by a rich kid that bought alot of transcendence  decoder.. if they fixed this im sure this game will be almost PERFECT i think alot of people agree with that"
7198,"Some menu features dont work, anti-cheat is bull****. Overall the game is low quality and not worth downloading or risking your PC with 10 year old anti-cheat files."

Why does require such a good graphic but when u come to the game the graphics is barely what they offer you? Why the graphics so bad than Counter-Strike Franchises?

Op guns shine in Zombie Hero.. But there are TONS of maps and ALOT of gamemodes.  Dont play this if you play csgo tf2 black ops1/2/3 etc its a downgrade.

And there are more dlcs to buy just for more weapons skins and maps...


What a shame. All i can tell is this was imported from CS 1.6 which was a great game to remember. (still play it in 2016 YOLO M8s...)


The game feels like you installed a zombie mod only. and just some weapons skins from FPS Banana....

Codename Cure was more success than this one. Disappointed.

7245,"Experinced CS player plays for a few hours gets some free *decoders* got a pistol that shots laser beams joins a team deathamatch against lvl60-70 thought i was going to get rekt in the end after the second game i was kicked by the host who i was having a 1v1 laser pistol battle and kept winning

They started trash talking and calling me a noob i was like ""you are the one getting destoryed by a pistol"" to be fair that thing has a ridiculous range like Dust 2 i could shoot from the top of ramp all the way to pit and still be accurate because its a laser beam, but they also started using it so i would call it a fair fight
10/10 would play again"
7246,"This pretty much looks like any fucking microtransaction game from the rice fields of Korea.
In-depth explanation:
CSN:Z is a standalone game based of CS 1.6'S Zombie Mode, graphics wise and game play wise.

However, this game (as mentioned above) is a microtransaction game which means to actually kill the zombies single handedly, you've either got to ""rent"" or ""buy"" the guns, which involves opening up your wallet to the Korean Gaben.

Also after playing this game my computer refused to start up completely, (NOTE: it was fine BEFORE CSN:Z was installed) after figuring out that this game was presumably the problem, I was forced to factory reset my computer to get rid of all the shit that this game left behind.
0/10 never playing this cash grab game again."

So far it's fun and it is not p2w, atleast i think it isn't. Would recommend this as its free cs, has zombie mod and tons of guns"

7280,"Hello there,
after putting some of my, in retrospective, ""wasted"" time into this game, I just have to recommend it to anybody. There is no hate in this game and even if you dont want to, people will still invite you into playing with them. YOU WILL NEVER FEEL ALONE!!!!! The Zombies are all quite attractive and  dont get me started on the nurses. Dammn Daniel i came the moment i saw those godesses. 
Here is a little list of things you may/should have to really enjoy this game:
1. A lot of lubricant -> Those nurses are on average quite dry
2. Russian citizenship -> Only a true russian underage can enjoy this 
3. Being a virgin -> It's always your first time. Why not celebrate it in an absolutely illegal and bad way 
4. Mommys credit card -> He hung for your sins. So take that head onto the LMG
If that applies to you this is your game 
"
7281,"If you are into wearing giant salmons on your back, then this game is just what you've been looking for.
Apart from that, deleting the game makes you feel great. So give it a try.
When they ask you for feedback, don't forget to rate it 0/10.

7297,Free and ugly cs (Positive evaluation)
7298,"there is no reason for calling this a good game, I played this once and that half an hour was just pure cancer. it kept throwing enemies that can be compared to hell's barons from doom at my face all the time and i didn't see a single zombie. if this really is supposed to be a zombie game, then i'm not impressed. 0/10"
7299,"Its a really good game.Its like if this was real zombie invasion.My only dislike is the fact that one hit from a zombie,your a zombie,but thats what makes it realistic."

I do not know that this ""anticheat"" is detecting, and neither do i care. But upon searching the internet a bit, this ""anticheat"" which is apparently made by a 10 year old because its so shitty and useless, does some pretty shady and maybe not even legal stuff. For example, checking your browser history, checking browser cookies and so on.

This shitty anticheat will kick your for atleast one of the following:
- Have a page visited which the devs dont like.
- Use programs with a ""hooking"" feature. (Dont know what this means though)
- Have programs like RAPTR or Overwolf installed. (NEITHER of those are cheats)




This couldy actually be a nice game to spend some time with, but because of that shitty cancer anticheat, which kicks you for almost everything, this can leave my library now."
7309,when i click play on steam i click play and it says this game needs steam I ARELARDY GOT  THE GAME ON STEAM WHY IS THIS HAPPEING TO ME!!!!!
7310,"Reasons simply why I did not like this game:

1 ) Main menu always windowed and going offscreen (can't resize it)
2 ) Horribly limited console
3 ) So many microtransactions (as well as ""rewards"" you get for only a certain ammount of time)
4 ) Game & Menu does not fit (makes it hard to even do certain things)
5 ) Horrible looking UI becuase of the old engine
6 ) Nexon, I think is a korean company, which explains these weird ass characters (zombies that look like copied Resdient Evil monsters, except worse)
7 ) TOO OP WEAPONS! for those who pay huge amounts of money
8 ) I CAN'T QUIT/CLOSE THE GODDAMN GAME UNLESS I CLOSE STEAM ITSELF! EVEN IF THE GAME IS ACTUALLY CLOSED!

Ive only played this for a certain amount of hours (About an hour), And that how fast I disliked it..."

It can't even close correctly! I've literally been juggling Steam, Windows and Nexon: Zombies for 20 minutes now trying to get this removed from my system.
Who knows what kind of DRM and anti-cheat crapware was left behind on my system?"

7331,"I used to like this game. But then it stopped working and now everytime I open the game up, it immediately crashes and now it is impossible for me to play this now."
7332,BlackChiper not initialized... what I have to do?
7333,Wow. This is just sad. I couldnt even play more than a few rounds the graphics were so bad. All of the textures look like they were copied from 80's arcade games. Just dont waste your time on this.
7334,This game is definitely not an improvement from the last counter strike game global offensive. It has poor gameplay and the stupid matches with the zombies are terrible the only good thing about the game is normal matches with no zombies. I hope valve is going to make another counter strike game to make up for this disappointment.
7335,WOW
7336,"The menu is hard to navigate, the game is pay to win, and 2007 graphics but it still updates."
7337,"I downloaded this game and I can say it's actually good! It's CS 1.6 only with a bunch of more modes like TDM, Arms Race, Zombie Mode etc and I can say it's nice to spend your time on. It features tons of different weapons and some of them can be even transformed (like the MP7). GoldSrc engine at it's best. Also it has more maps but the graphics still remain the same just a little bit better. If the renderer was changed from the default one to one used in Cry of Fear (which is also a GoldSrc engine game) then this game would be even better. 

But still a very good game to play. Give it a shot!"
7338,"this is the worst game developed by valve,it is a waste of wifi,and the graphics are so low in quality.
this  happens when  valve develops a free game"
7339,i like this game :D
7340,Its pretty good but you could make bigger maps.
7341,"The game is fun when it actually works. You may be saying ""It works for me"", I have a good PC and have played since day 1 of this game. It has had the same game loading issue since forever where it goes unresponsive. It's just a poorly optimized game. I also recommend turning the volume down to 10%-25% since the game's audio isn't exactly high quality and is extremely loud. The game is extremely P2W even after all the changes, sure it's better but it hasn't dug itself out of that hole exactly yet.


I only recommend playing this game as a side-gig, the content is extremely limited and with all the crashing it does surprisingly even SIX years after it's initial release."
7342,fun
7343,"If you like CS games i'm sure you'll feel at home. However, I've never been a fan of them. Its my opinion that they are all awkward to play with weird mechanics and just overall gameplay. I grew up playing games such as original Duke Nukem, Unreal Tournament games etc. Those to me were so much enjoyable and had a better feel to them. CS games just feel so tight, movement is weird and just doesn't flow or feel natural. 

Either way I wanted to give this a go, thinking free game why not...can't be too bad... Well it's horrible... Graphics could easily be upgraded and improved on, pixels...pixels everywhere, just looks bad. Gameplay, same CS feel I get, nothing flows right, very uncomfortable to play, movement and mechanics all strange. Little tutorial help, unless you've never played a first person shooter, tutorial is almost no help. Explains nothing about crafting, items. Clicking through all these daily rewards which there is no info about. What are these items? Why do they matter? How do I use them? Says I unlocked all these guns and got them, but not access to them? Can't equip or use. 

In 22 minutes of gameplay i'm already extremely overwhelmed with so many features and options with no tutorial. I have no interest in playing and spending hours going outside of the game to figure out what half of it is, how it works etc. Doesn't take a smart person to realize the game is centered around pay-to-win. Or at least, pay to have fun or get anything good. If this was a game like World Of Warcraft, that makes sense to have purchase options for mounts, its an MMO, you buy that to show it off and have something unique. In a first person shooter, I come to shoot things and have fun, not have to worry about crafting systems, pay-to-win setup or anything like that. 

Overall, very clunky, doesn't look or feel good and way too much fluff and pay to win. After exiting, had to shutdown computer because the game was still running even though in task manager, no game was running. I simply cannot fathom how there is any enjoyment or fun in any type of game like this and this is why I cannot recommend it. I'm sure many will disagree, obviously this type of game-style is not for me...it's free and I guess you can always try and decide for yourself."
7344,"The game is pretty good, I like the graphics. The gameplay is very nice, the community is pretty nice.
I love playing this with my friends, family, dog. It's pretty good.































Oh wait, this is Nexon Zombies. Nah this shit is terrible."
7345,"This game is amazing. Yeah you may not like the graphics but the gameplay is great.
        [|PROS|]
  -you can get cool items for free
  -cool camos ingame 
  -more weapon varieties than CSGO (Ex. Battle Axe, Fists, and Swords)
        [|CONS|]
  -Graphics are terrible
  -not many online players so you'll have to play againts bots

7354,"CSN:Z is not a bad game, in fact some time ago i think it was great in its own way. The weapons were actually somewhat balanced and it was more about skill than how lucky you got with your crafting or decoders. But now, things have changed. So many new weapons were introduced, and a lot of of them are just BETTER than the older ones, for example THANATOS - 7 and THANATOS - 9, these weapons are just overpowered, with THANATOS - 9 you can almost kill zombie BOSSES with one attack in Zombie giant, which can take 5 hits from almost any other melee and not lose half of their health, same thing with THANATOS - 7, but a little bit less ridicilous. The game was fun, but its going downhill with these new updates. Now in Zombie Scenario it will take you 40+ minutes to kill a boss with more older weapons, but with the new ones it will take you a max of 15 minutes. I wish Nexon thought about the balance of their game more, and fixed all of this, because right now, i'm always at the bottom of the scoreboard in Zombie Hero because i just get rect by all these M4A1 Dark Knights, AK-47 Paladins which kill me with one mag, even though i have 30k+ health. Before i used to be in Zombie PVP HQ once, which is basically the highest league of zombie pvp players. Try the game if you want, it still has some gamemodes which aren't broken because of the new weapons.  A lot of people claim its p2w, i would have definetly disagreed before, but now it's kinda getting to that point."

-> This 2000s-graphics game crashes at the boot as if my computer had not enough graphics sources. Yeah,of course,it is just a $1.000 PC in 2016,and I can't run a game with 360p textures and late '90s antimations? Are you serious?
-> And wat about what happens when you close the game? Why is this supposed to open Internet Explorer? Also when you close it you can't re-start the game because Steam says that the game is already running while I closed it minutes ago.
You have to exit from Steam and kill Internet Explorer via task manager,are you fucking kidding?

Very undetectable mofos who don't give a rat's guts worth darn ! I give them mofos thumbs down........

This MMO-ACTION-SURVIVAL game is still alive of developers still updating and upgrading. A UP/DOWN like(s) & dislike(s) of this game. Go ahead and ride your hellish thoughts into this & out of hell of this game & enjoy !! And be aware of hack-cheaters, they eat amongst the weak of ya & trying to push ya out to lose. But for me, been there - knowned it....... Chow ! Oh..... And one thing............. It's not all pay to win, just pay wisely and save wisely is all. | For those whom are new to this, look up this review of mine and this game itself and beware, becareful, and pay wisely & spend wisely or play it like it is 1999.

thank you nexon for resetting stuff that i bought"
7411,"An awesome game made by NEXON. I enjoyed playing this game because of all the weird new maps, guns and fun modes such as Zombie Shelter, Gun Game and even Classic Counter:Strike modes.

I found this more fun than CS:GO because in CS:GO, there are too many stupid people which ruins the game. There are also lots of hackers and smurfs which I don't enjoy.

The only problem I found with this game is a very minor one, the Graphics.

Even though having a CS 1.6 look is has a nostalgic feel to it, Other people want good Graphics like CS:GO's one (Which is the only good thing about CS:GO). It would make the game feel much more up-to-date and just make the game even better.

Overall this was a god game you guys should play if you just had enough of CS:GO. Or just buy Source (Come on, Source was the best one)."
7412,WORST GAME EVER. THIS GAME NEEDS TO BE DELETED FROM STEAM. 0.1/10! WTF IS THIS SH*T??? THE GRAPHICS!!!!! THE GAMEPLAY!!! ITS ALL HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DONT DOWNLOAD!!!!1
7413,"Counter Strike Online, also known as Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies also know known as Counter Strike Nexon: Studio is a game that has a lot of personailty that was running well back in 2014, clearly being special to anyone who may like CS:S. This game was a long time ago a very fun and promising game, there was this crazy soccer mode, and all these zombies, and everything. The only thing alive in the game mostly now is the zombie mode. Makes since, being the game is that right? Well, as you can see now the game is called studio. This created a very creative space for that game that was along the lines of something like Gmod or a minecraft creative like experience. I think its a very cool and genious idea and its clear its its biggest edition. I just feel looking at this game now on the store makes people even less likely to play it from the outside perspective. Heres the biggest problem though:

 The core game as of now. Idk how long this has been going on, but this game now lives off of some of the most OP pay to win content. If you play this game, you'll get maybe something decent weekly, that only lasts usually like a day, it will force you to pay for something to truly enjoy it. Not just that, of course this is where opening cases comes in. Which the most OP weapons out there are rare, so even a commitment will probably be a loss. The game itself is unbalanced. There is such a large concept behind Human guns, that zombies dont even stand a chance anymore. In a game even where S tier weapons exist, you still had to aim them and use them well. Now guns come out playing the game for you, sticking zombies in the air like a black hole, and AIMING FOR YOU. Basically, auto aim guns. I think its sad...

I see this game as something special, and it was something special when I played it for a short few hours years ago. However, now its a game thats swarmed by overwhelming pay to win for the small dedicated community to eat up. This game seriously should have been something much bigger, and its a shame that it seems like if anything its digging itself deeper into the ground over time. Even some dedicated fans who have thousands of hours have left in recent years since the STUDIO change. Some in a single week, lost all of their stuff because of an absurd game change. An update to studio where if someone didn't log in for that week lost everything basically.

This event cut in half and already small player base, and today, the game sits with seemingly a 400 consistent player count. Which, its beyond me how those 400 even stick with it, but power to them. They probably have good items for long to come. Especially guns that play the game for them.

To add insult to injury, the mode that helps zombies most, is the evolution mode, where there are many different types of zombies. I believe there's like 12+ with different abilities that really helps fight against the absurd weapon imbalance but still doesn't come close. The point Im getting to, is that the only servers that are ever running are the basic mode, so basically, once your a zombie the game has died for you that round. I see even the community some will just idle as a zombie because yeah, its obviously not fun against these op weapons that pin you to a wall or stick you in the air until you die.

CS Nexon Zombies, or what is now CS Nexon studio was a game that was promising now killing itself over time.The game is still surprisingly active, and in two days of this review I believe a new ABSURD weapon is coming out. So... yay? Thats the most suprising thing though, the consistency of the developer. I really hope they take a big turn in what they are doing because I think this game could make a comeback if they play their cards right maybe.

For now, I suppose its best just to bring out powerful weapons, insane, broken, weapons for the small community they have left that will buy them... A shame...

7414,love this game
7415,"After more than 506 hours ingame I can say that this game is cool and very fun. There are so many game mods that it\'s never boring in this game :D
About the weapons I can say only that you have to play to get used with the weapon because each one is useful in a different case. If you don\'t understand all of the game content don\'t worry for 3 hours of playing you will already know what you need! At least, there are many events which give you a good chance for a weapon or sth else.

For me: 9/10 stars :D"
7416,"If you have a shit computer and broke as fuck this game is it, i have a compaq laptop that can\'t run shit but it ran this game really well that it went over 60fps Im happy with it but I don\'t like where there is too many microtransactions that the guns they sell is too overpowered so if I were you play this game for fun, if play for competitve play counter strike 1.6 :)"

7431,"Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Nexon doesn't know what they're doing. They know EXACTLY what they're doing. Nexon is undertaking a systematic effort to change this game, to make Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies more like the rest of games.

That's why they created the Magnum Drill and THANATOS-9 and the Airburster and got rid of 30 decoders a day. It is a systematic effort to change Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies. When I'm at the top of the leaderboards of the Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies, we are going to re-embrace all the things that made Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies the greatest game in the world and we are going to leave our children with what they deserve: the single greatest game in the history of the world."

7448,cs + zombies = slighty above average
7449,"It is a mediocre mod at best, but the ""Aegis Institute"" weapons are the pinnacle of design. These reskins, these beautiful and well designed reskins. Are the coolest and most awe-inspiring thing in this entire freaking game. My true strife with this game comes the North American and the Chinese version. The NA version has these horrible gambling devices called decoders to maximize profit. While the Chinese versions just allow you to buy everything in the in-game shop. I don't like in the slightest because playing with the unique skinned weapons is the most fun thing in this game, there guns outside of the Aegis Institute and even those are fucking badass.

7466,"Decent enaugh. 
allot of fun, and a bit of frustrations. 
a free mix that most can endure ;D

lacking in some ways, and has variations that make upp for most of the lackings.

all in all, decent good stuff for free."
7467,"This game has probably been my most played game and I regret every single second of it. Constantly being unrewarded for coming back time and time again, this game and it's asshat developers do not give a fuck about any of it's players. The only this cumdumpster of a game wants is to swallow your money from the shitty pay to win decoders and weapon sets, which include most weapons that can actually kill some zombies. 

Now although I can't say I didn't have my fair share of good weapons, I still didn't get anything THAT good, which is why I know the game will never actually reward me with something useful, unless I'm talking about cancer, which is still not useful.

On to the actual zombies mode, one specific zombie that is the bane of this game's existence is the heavily over-used ""light zombie"" (Emphasis on light since it can jump 50ft high and turn invisible at any time, oh and that's before it's upgraded.) I can say I have killed a lot of light zombies but it really does take the biscuit when every single other player is using this fucking zombie and you're always the survivor. This zombie is a really big turning point in my decision to delete this game since it has consumed over 300+ hours of my life, it is hard to hit, hard to see, can jump and even has a power-up for higher jumps? It was nerfed but that made jackshit difference. It's just a clusterfuck of overpowered abilities and even worse movement, this zombie should be limited to at least 2 max in one room.

Besides the bullshit zombies and the under-whelming weapons you receive for your time put into the game, it wasn't that bad of a game. It has other modes which are fun to play, I reccommend gun deathmatch, but that's about it. Otherwise this game is useless, unless you want free counter-strike.

Overall this game has given me hemmorhoids and aids. Also the sight to not waste my time playing games that barely reward you for loyalty. I did previously unistall the game but decided to give it another chance and that worked as well as a trip to uranus, it was full of shit.

Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice, shame on me."

CSNZ
It's CS with Zombies, The crafting is kinda like having all cheat codes turned on at all times. Well in the zombie modes that is.

There's lots of Guns, Maps & Game Modes
Even A Free DLC pack & BINGO! If your into that.

I have played more than 200hrs and have never found the need to buy anything and people do tend to share. (If someone is willing to share with you it might be a good idea to befriend them)  I feel like I can say that this Is a REAL F2P. It is a complete game at download. 

There is however a few ""Cons"" I thought the real down side with some of the community, acting rude and just all around not very kind to the new players. Almost as if some of the higher ranked players think they just just started out at Lv100.  The term ""NOOB"" is way over used. NewB has been around longer than most of the players have been alive. But still its used as if is was like a little kid just learn a new Cool word that all the Popular Kids are saying. I mean come on guys give'um a brake the game really isn't that grate. There is other games out there. At around 300+hrs of game play now and still just as Rude as ever. 

Make as Many Friends as you can, as you move up through the ranks, and or bring some friends with you into the game if you can. I don't see why anyone who likes FPS's, Counter Strike & or ZOMBIES wouldn't have a good time playing this game. 

(In a nut shell it reminds me of Hunter Thompson's analogy of Circus Circus and an alternate outcome to World War II. Though If they didn't win this game would be Left 4 Dead.) 

Thanks for reading.

7486,Gud game
7487,its good but basically pay to do most of the things in the game
7488,good ig
7489,Great and awsome
7490,"This is an abomination. Terrible game with trash community and you will barely find someone who speaks English but when you do he's going to curse at you. If you want to get the good weapons you'll have to spread your wallet wider than a woman spreading her legs when she's giving birth. Terrible pay to win game.
If you want to craft a permanent weapon...GOOD LUCK.

-It used to have missions that rewarded you with decoders and you had a fair chance at winning a permanent weapon but they removed them because apparently there were people who abused it. So instead of actually fixing the problem they just showed us how not to deal with it and removed them from the mission rewards. Now you will have to waste 3 hours of your precious time in this terrible excuse of a game so you can get 3 decoders.

- you can play bingo for nice rewards. But now that you can barely get any points from the decoders it'll take you months to actually get something. Did they really think this through? I don't think so...or maybe they just didn't care.

-Some skins are terrible. They blend in with some walls and you can barely see them from a far. Add a little bit of lag and you have it.

-Who in their right mind wakes up and says ""I'll make an invisible zombie that is able to jump high""? Fire that guy.

But we know that the reason is most likely so people would buy the decoders from the store. If they really valued their players they would do that but what do you expect from a game made to grab cash.

I regret every second I spent on this and I am here to help you guys so you won't do the same mistake. Do you see the amount of hours I spent on the game? This is the amount of times I had to get exorcism so I could get this abomination out of my system."

but its fan made so yeah. like. maybe."
7502,"Here is my review on this crap game:

Okay let's start off a little positive i *Love* Half life and half life 2 and all mods and Garry's mod. but this, THIS abomination you call a game shoulden't exist here is why:

Story: There is none this is a muliplayer fps that uses the half life engine|NA
Graphics: VERY oudated it uses the half life engine which is like 15 years old possibly older though i did like the half life engine a lot i always like the assets in it and envoirments and NPC in mods so 6/10 because i do like the engine so i'll cut it a little slack.

Gameplay: You bassically shoot zombies with guns and that's it. It is a muliplayer game though, so the people are the zombies you kill. It isn't innovative,creative,nothing. there are tons of zombie fps games but this is a bad one 4/10

Compatibility: This game though runs Perfectly because it uses such an old engine the game will literally run at like 100 fps once you run the game so it get's points for being so easy to run 10/10

Enjoyment: i did enjoy the game a little bit even though it is unorignal and same objectives as a regular zombie fps nothing new but still i kinda enjoyed it. 5/10

Final results: 6.2/10 this game is just unoriginal that's it that's all i can say about this game as the final results meh game."

Alot of those remakes usually go off the main game topic but in this case ,this doesnt affect gameplay completely,mainly because the original cs 1.6 had mods like zm,zm,gg,dm.
But this just improves it , because it makes tje modded games easier to host and find.
This version just accepted the community mods into the game itself.
The only minus i found were those op weapons for real money, but rest of gameplay is very fun,and actually better than 1.6 in most aspects

7560,"Alright, Its about time i give this game a review in depth. Do know before you begin reading this review that this is a very HONEST review. Even though some aspects of this game aren't the most ideal and great i do still enjoy this game till today. Please feel free to edit me if any way if i misunderstood some aspects of this game, I am always open to new ideas. Sorry for the essay guys xD!

Positive:
- Large variety of guns to select from.
- Alot of different modes and maps to choose and play from.
- Family and groups to hang out with.
- Old counter strike maps to play on.
- Have both PvP And PvE.
- A nice story line.
- A nice community who are willing to help out.
- Most of the computers can run this game smoothly.
- Alot of very active and helpful mods in this game.
- Constant updates (There is updates every 2 weeks)

Negative:
- Requires a lot of grinding.
- Alot of campers in this game.
- Very loud and unbalanced sound.
- Very unbalanced weapons.
- Really bad graphics.
- Game layout may be difficult for new players to navigate.
- Many of the weapons and items you get in the game are durable.
- There isn't alot of english players in this game.
- Events are quite repetitive in this game
- There are bugs in some of the maps and modes.

Now lets get to the hot topic of this game.

Is this game a free to play game?

Before i answer this question i just want you guys to know that this game is heavily based on luck and the following answer is based on players who are just normal players with normal luck going into the game.

This game is a free to play game if you don't mind having a bunch of durable weapons and items. Being killed by other players with better weapons. Being killed by zombies in the zombie hero mode or zombie scenario. However you can still enjoy the different modes and maps without paying a single penny! This is what you will experience if you are willing to invest in at around 15 hours into this game.

This however can be changed but it requires a large amount of grinding and a few hundred hours invested into the game. Now lemme explain the systems in this game and how it works.

This game like i said before offers a lot of durable weapons and items. However if you do want permeant weapons and don't want to pay a single penny it is still very possible. This method will require you to invest at least a few hundred hours if you are a player who has a average luck like i do. Now the ways you can earn permeant weapons are through events (Do know that many events don't offer permeant weapons), crafting, extension coupons, mileage decoders and by bingo boards. Now lemme go through briefly each of these systems.

Events:
Events in this game sometimes offer decoders and supreme decoders (Most are really few to nothing) and gives out weapons at times depending on the month. Some of the weapons given like the christmas weapons have a duration. Other events like the spell the weapon name event gives permeant weapons however doesn't have much of a difference compared to the default weapons (This is changed due to some new updates like the serpeant blade or the fire axe... The weapons depends on the event so if you manage to play on a good event then there are good weapons out there for you to get) Also i just want to add that Nexon is being more and more generous with the events on counter strike nexon zombies. The most recent event lets players get 10 decoders everyday for playing one and a half hour + the 3 you can get everyday and 3 you can get every week. This event will last for more than a month so you can end up with more than 400+ decoders. Nexon has also been giving out free premium decoders to the users lately which is why Nexon's events are getting better and they are being more generous.

The crafting system:
This system is mostly used when you complete daily missions, grind zombie kills and decomposing your weapons (Most popular one) Now to actually have a chance of even getting a permeant weapon you need to sythensize and combine your durables to 72 days - permeant. Do know that this process can fail and result you with nothing left. Now if you were lucky enough to go through that you also have to do the same with the blueprints. After all that is done you still aren't offered a 100% chance at getting a permeant craft you still have the chance to fail. From my hours and i may just have been a really unlucky guy after a few hundred hours into the game i have only crafted one permeant weapon. This is just one way to earn a permeant weapon. However you can also stack up your duration of the weapon so for example if you have dual infinity for 100 days if you open another decoder with dual infinity 100 days it will stack on top of each other untill it becomes permeant which is 999 days.

Extension coupons:
Now to earn extension coupons you can either get this from decoders or by disasembling weapons. When you disasemble weapons and if you are doing this right with a large amount of weapons you have the chance of earning a few extension coupons. When you open decoders you have the chance to win around 20 extension coupons ++ and the max you can earn i believe is around 500. With that you need to save up to 999 extension coupons with that you can then make one permeant weapon.

Mileage decoders:
Mileage decoders are like buying lottery or opening lottery the chances of earning permeant weapons can be scarce at times and won't get you much. If you are lucky you can get some permeant weapon at your first opening. However if you are unlucky you can open a hundred decoders and not get a single permeant weapon.

Bingo board:
In the bingo board you can pick up some really good permeant weapons. However to be able to use the bingo board you will need to open decoders which will grant you 30 to around 50 mileage points. Now you are only able to earn 3 mileage decoders a day which requires you to play a total of 3 hours. With these mileage points you can choose to reset your board to get good permeant weapons which requires 50 mileage points and changing the grand prize for 350. Now as you advance in the bingo board your opening special numbers will increase and so will opening random numbers making you need to grind and farm more for permeant weapons. In general if you are a free to play player it will require a large amount of game time and investment.

Weapon upgrade event:
When the weapon upgrade event comes around you can upgrade non permeant weapons into permeant weapons but with a even stronger form then its previous. This event usually brings 4 weapons that can be upgraded into the game. All you have to do is just open a few mileage decoders or craft the weapon which is quite easy if you save up alot of mileage decoders or blue prints and is another way to earn powerful and permeant weapons.

If you can endure everything i have just mentioned above, install and play away it is indeed a free to play game if done right. I just want to say that i do enjoy this game and i really like it and would recommend it to my friend. However i just wanted to do a honest in depth review of the game. I still love this game though! It is still part of my favorites! Anyway thanks for reading! I also just wanted to add that this game is getting much better and Nexon is being way more generous in the events they have recently."
7561,"only got this because i thought it was a day z/counter strike mix.




















lord, was i wrong."
7562,Shitty and moded game :(((((
7563,"Theres not much to say about this game. This game, personally, I use for the fun and not a competetive aspect. It's really not much a skill based game but that's what makes it so fun to play."
7564,"Horrible game, no waypoints or anything just a normal survival game, sometimes it crashes upon loading in the game which is really bad."
7565,"When dank memes meet counter strike, you get this game"
7566,"its btter then scgo to me or a number of reasons 

1 hit detection is not rubbish and i can actually hit the target at close range for once 

2 not as toxic and can run on most computers quite well even if it is as rubbish as mine

3 the weapons are great but remind me of a ps2 game 

4 i can enjoy this game"
7567,Oh please ... it almost gave me cancer..
7568,yes 10 de 10
7569,good one <3
7570,Ehh... I honestly think this game could use a lot of fixing...
7571,"Nope
First P2W Game
Then repetitive gamemodes,earache and the decoders stoled THE GABEN CASE SIMULATOR I MEAN WHO THE FUCK DOES THAT?"
7572,Like a poor man's CSGO.
7573,Good Game recomand
7574,Love the new gamemodes and events
7575,this is a very good game but you do need a decent computer.
7576,"yes
"
7577,"Thought this might be fun, but 20 minutes in and i can tell that this game has NO redeeming qualities. this is not worth your time, even though it's free."
7578,"Honestly, this is one of the worst games I have ever played. However I do recomend it because its free and there a re a few redeming qualities.

Pros
-as long as you expect garbage you won't be dissapointed.
-most of the people who play this, only play it because they cant afford cs:go. If you play cs:go, you can wipe the floor with most people.
-new guns.
-The zombie mode is kinda interesting.



Cons
-You can only change the screen sise when in a game, and not in any menus.
-It's kinda pay to win, but it's mainly pay to have a girl playermodel
-I can understand the crap graphics, but I can't understand how it still lags.
-if you play go you will be confused in some of the maps.
-hard to get a regular five on five game.
-with the amount of guns, it's hard to buy indiviual items quickly at round start.
-the way the ui is configured makes everything realy confusing
-way too many things to do for a game you will not realy enjoy
-you will hate it but find yourself still playing
-even sprays are purchaseable
-no explanation of a game mode in the game lobby
-if you play go then you will have a hard time throwing nades
-some of the maps feel extreamly sided towards one team (for example one map has a ct open spawn, and a t cloded spawn that the ct can trap the t in easily)
-little explanation of how to do things: preselecting zombie class, prebuying weapons, ect.

Is this game fun? Kinda. Is it bad? Of course. Should you play it? Probably not, but it's free so I can't really complain."
7579,"oikkeh
"
7580,Yes.........so much yesss
7581,love this game
7582,"i like this game
its cool"
7583,"I tried this game but in my opinion its too complicated and to be really honest, this is one of many fps with a pre-fixed format and crappy ""new"" modes out there. Sorry but I can't say I enjoyed this game."
7584,"3 Things you should do before you install this game
1.Fucking look at it
2.Compare it to previous Counter-Strike's (1.6)
3. Burn Nexon
4. Fucking get MapleStory if your that bored"
7585,"It used to be a  good game in early 2015

now its just a 'RIP' game with a broken community"
7586,"it says im in the game when im play other games
"
7587,great game
7588,The game is pretty good! Even though I have CS:GO I still play this sometimes.
7589,"is good have bad and good thinks 
good.f4p and free cs condition easy to learn play
bad.you need to spend money for be pro and have many cheaters"
7590,"0/10 pay to win don't waist your valuable time on this poor excuse of a game
and spyware on the installer so don't risk losing your credit card number
or something ?!?"
7591,"i would say this is pretty good for a free counter-strike game. its a great game, you just need the right computer. the zombies are fun, especially with others, and gun deathmatch has the oddest guns. the first gun you get is an assault rifle made of legos. the interface is very confusing, but overall its a great game"
7592,PVP IS FUCKING TERRIBLE. But the zombie game modes are great. As long as you don't buy anything you are good
7593,excelente juego
7594,"So lets see f2p check
Cs 1.6 check
Online version of cs on english check
hmmm what else...ah yes...dose of mixed opinion"
7595,GoooD
7596,"pl ta gra jest bardzo dobra dla graczy
eng this game is good for gamers"
7597,HUAUUNaunabygyuabnauNUNUINESUNDFEUNDFNUDUSNFIS
7598,This is a great version for anyone that likes old school CS. It has a lot of the old maps along with a bunch of new ones. The zombie aspect is fun as well and very challenging.
7599,10/10 4 crash your pc m8
7600,.......
7601,"Imagine a cake that was both sweet and tasted like shit; That's what this game is. The OG CS 1.6 is here in all it's glory but there are pay2win guns, although all the og weapons are available with no real money needed. The zombie modes in this game are kind of a mixed bag though, as they all have a really unprofessional feel to them, barring the DayZ type mode, which I found pretty interesting. To make it short, try this if you wanna kill some time with your friends. It's a lot better than some of the other F2P FPS' here on steam."

7606,"It's not bad honestly,the gameplay is similar to other Counter Strike Games, but fun, at least for a while."
7607,bullshit ass game
7608,The graphics are terrible and the game just doesn't have any appeal to make up for its aged look. The game is terrible compared to modern FPS games.
7609,"i didnt like it
"
7610,"IT's ok, not so bad. Good idea, good gameplay, have CS 1.6 based gameplay. But there's an error, when you just close its window, game continue open registering time played on steam. Almost I think this error must be solved."
7611,Ugly graphics
7612,"Yreaking youndries in the YeFPS Yenre, Yould Yecommend Yen/Yen!"
7613,This game is total fuckin shite
7614,IT ISN'T WORTH YOUR TIME
7615,I love this game i am so morbidly addicted to nexon they suck every penny out of me since maplestory beta I cant belive I waisted $400+ dollars on this game I really need help... counterstirke AND nexon this was crafted in satans lounge with my demise in mind...
7616,Very good game for a counter strike gamemode
7617,it's alright if you have money to waste
7618,GG

7623,So laggy in loading screens mai gawd
7624,HOLY crap!!! this game is HOOOORRRRRIIIIBBBBLLLEEEE!!! Wooow. Just all around poor... About as poor as this review. I dont even know where to start! Just.. **** BAD!
7625,"is a fun game
"
7626,"lol
"
7627,aids
7628,"1) It is tough to determine if this is better than just playing the zombie mod on CS:S.

2) This game would be awesome without the P2W aspect.

3) It is also fun.

I am indifferent on this game. But it is fun."
7629,Crappy graphics. Confusing system. Confusing Gameplay. Dont get it
7630,"it's a good game.
i play it for the ZOMBIES.
thats why its called counter strike nexon: ZOMBIES."
7631,Good game !
7632,love this game easyer to get equitmant and wepons than csgo
7633,na
7634,I rather dance to barney and friends then play this game
7635,It's ok & free. Highly recommend to try it out!
7636,"i dont even know how this game exists, its probably from another dimension where games suck."
7637,"Used to be able to recommend this, Do not get me wrong it is a good game, It takes CS but mods it in a different way from surfing and deathrun or whatever else, Mainly going for the zombie twist, even has the basic gamemodes, although I'd still say basic CS is better, So why cant I recommend it? Pet peeves really. I will continue playing the game but that dosent mean I recommend it. So let me start off the list, Zombie scenario is bassicly Zombie Scenario ""2 map edition"" This isnt the developers fault. but they could of done more to prevent everyone flocking to Poisonous wound and that one other map, In competitive gamemodes, Well due to some of the cosmetics, I find it impossible to tell friend from foe, For example. I ignored an enemy CT because his cosmetics make him look T like, Im certain this is just me, but I felt it was worth mentioning. Oh and heres one that I do my best to pretend never existed, ""Vote to kick"" is something you need to buy with ingame points, Yeah 20k In game points (Is about one weeks grind on and off likely less) to get 5 vote kicks, I never bought them because its stupid as shit, but I shouldnt need to. All in all, Good game, Poor choices and lack of incentive."
7638,Hi guys.Everytime i want to launch game its just crash do u know what i need to do?
7639," I LOVE THIS GAME!!!
"
7640,"its entretaining but its not that good. Except for the zombies mode, aslo classic counter strike is good."
7641,Game was great! Sure bad graphics but hey it's an older game.It is fantastic gameplay.
7642,10/10 :P i really like it
7643,Goood game tnx
7644,This Fun Game
7645,kiLLMYSLEF GOOD
7646,"cool game , see you in-game"
7647,"other than the micro transaction, unclear crafting system, same weapons/equipments extracted from decoders, this game is fun if u are a good fps player and want to burn out some steam"
7648,Its good for people who cant afford any conterstrike games

7650,"It was a dark stormy night in Warszaw, you could hear the rain fall as it thundered in a distance. Harry was just 11 years old, he enjoyed playing video games, yes video games, especially on his computer. Harry was just done earning every single achievement on The Binding of Issac, he was happy, very happy. He had earned every achievement in the game. But then Harry scrolled through his 300+ game library and realized... there was no game left to play. Harry had played every single game in his library, earnd every single achievement and unlocked every single unlock. Harry was sad. Very sad. His parents weren't home, he couldn't ask them for money to purchase new games. He became desperate and in his desperation he turned his last hopes to the free-to-play category on Steam. He already had 700+ hours on Team Fortress 2, collected every single hat, every single achievement, no... he couldn't play that game. The other games didn't interest him as much. He scrolled and scrolled, forever, until... he came across Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies. He was already a Global Elite on Global Offensive, and he had played the previous Counter Strikes. This seemed perfect to him. Like a sign from god that said, download me, he heard in a distance as the voice faded. He decided to download it. He launched the game, full of excitement and curiosity, he was then greeted by ads, microtransactions and daily rewards. Harry realized what he had gotten himself into... it was a p2w game. But he refused to step down, he had nothing else to play. He joined a Team Deathmatch lobby, he spawned in with a AWP and a D-Eagle as his secondary and a smoke grenade. He took a couple of steps forward, BUT THEN OUT OF NOWHERE a flying player flies over Harry and spots him, the game crashes. His computer turns itself off... Harry sits there clueless, what happened, he asked himself. But then, Harry started to hear something, a voice perhaps. His computer started to whisper to him, whispering random Counter Strike callouts, go Mid, go Mid, go B, Shop, go A, stop wait a minute, bomb planted, on A, it kept whispering. Then Harry's screen turns on, random code starts to show up, like this was some Matrix movie. He could start to hear something that sounded like Zombies outside his house. Yes, it was Zombies, but wait... it was Zombies from the game he just had played. Yes, they looked just as pixelated and grusome as the Zombies from the game he just had played. Random bottles of Vodka started to float in his room, car alarms could be heard outside, the computer kept whispering callouts, Zombies breaching his front door and breaking his windows, flashing lights in his room, his phone stared to play Anime intros, random absurd stuff started happening. But before Harry could do anything, a black hole opened behind Harry and sucked him and his setup into it. Harry was then never heard from again, he probably suffocated in space. 

The moral of Harry's story : Don't download Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies, or you'll end up like Harry.           

Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies recieves a 2/10 rating from me. 

Just don't bother with this game, save up some money and buy yourself a real Counter Strike game."
7651,"this game is the best game ever created. i r8 8/8 ign illuminati confirmed. i recommend to all kwickscopers out there. faze clan should play this instead of csgo. if you read this review no scam you will get 1 million dollars, no 3 million no scam../\"

7657,in my opinion it is a good game well done :)
7658,Horrible.
7659,"if you are looking for a game that is like CS:GO this isnt it. the game play is very different, and the community. the only thing that is similar is the maps. I would not recommend this game unless you are a 12 yr old that is obesed with zombies"

7679,"Free CS:GO, with extra gamemodes. Sure its based off of CS:GO 1.6, but its free man! The extra gamemodes are the best, many different and very challenging zombie gamemodes. Zombie Heroes is like Versus Saxton Hale in tf2. But I would try it out. Even has free beginner DLC! I rate 7/10"
7680,It's a Free2Play Counter-Strike 1.6 what more do you want
7681,Bad...
7682,Good game actuly i dunno why people hate this so much plus we made the mistake of buying gmod on my birtday lol

7684,"It's a brand of Korean fuckshit that's vaguely Counter-Strike in nature. I don't care about the zombie part, which is good because it has TDM, but you'll spend your first hour wonder what's happening whilst getting shot by a lazer spitting ISIS sailor succubus in the middle of an arabian warzone.

If you like ""give us your money"" Korean MMO stuff, get it. If you saw the CS:O->CS 1.6 ports and only want this for the models, get it but don't play it. If you like a vague idea of what the fuck is happening and no microtransactions, you're better off with Condition Zero and some CS:O model ports."

Yay"

7695,"[h1]-=-=-=-=- HUGE WALL OF TEXT IMCOMMING! -=-=-=-=-[/h1]

Ok, where should we start?

        [b]Gameplay:[/b] 7/10 [u]OK[/u]

   Gameplay experiences here varies greatly, really depends what kind of player you are. In Teamdeath Match, Expect the most often used map is Dust 2, and Spawncampers. This is one of the reasons why new players deter from the game, thinking it is ""Pay 2 Win."" In Zombie pvp modes, Expect the mode on Hero mode and mainly on maps with camping/glitch spots. Other pvp modes are often not played at all, like soccar/hidden. The Best modes (in my opinion) by far are the PvE ""Scenarios."" Zombie scenarioes is the most played mode in the game, with ofc, zombies while completeing the map's specific objactives, like survivial, boss fights, and more.

         [b]Enjoyability:[b] 8/10 [u]Good[/u]

        There are many ways to enjoy the game, like exterimating the scenario bosses, hordes of zombies, and even getting premiums from the the soficicated ""Decoders."" But there ARE somethings that really takes away from it, like Blockers (Zombie PvE most common), Getting spawncamp by the opposing team, having bad decoder luck(getting all crap), etc.

        [b]Quality:[/b] 5/10 [u]ehhh.......[/u]

         The Graphics are very outdated to start off, since CS:NZ is basicly a westernised port of CSO. Weapons very geartly with unique abilites and ""Anti-Zombie"" weapons. There are still a TON of explots/glitches within the game for getting out of map, etc.

         [h1]Overall Score: 6.5/10[/h1]"
7696,Its a good game but the weapons are not permanent and not have a latinoamerican servers...
7697,meh
7698,"Best fun i've had in a while, easy to get into and is a blast to play. only problem is playing with friends and a fairly complicated start but once you've gotten passed that it's good."

7700,"its just C.S 1.6 but with zombies... whats wrong with it? its so adicting opening the DECODERS like CS:GO casses yeah....

this is my wish 
I will keep playing this 
Have a nice day and God bless you"

7710,i like new weapons and new zombies and skins and acsesuars
7711,"(Basically a modded Counter Strike 1.6 but on steroids.) Get some friends together or find a clan to play with and it's a chill time. For an MMO shooter, this is pretty alright. Modes are fun, guns are cool, and the characters are *nice*. Nice game to play competitively, or not. There are a bunch more intricacies that you'll just have to see for yourself. Also beware of p2w snobs who have their heads up their ass and you'll be fine."

Another Dislike is the lack of INFO about how to make rooms/how to choose game modes."
7713,Love It
7714,this game made me cum 4 times...by cum i mean actually cum to the computer xD (i know i spelt it wrong its a joke smart asses)

7717,Wait... this isn't CS:GO.

Like guns and everything here, but it could be more free stuff..."
7719,"The only reason you should have this is if you've never played cs before and you want to see what its like for free. Even then its probably not the best indicator because the actual game is so much better. Its pretty hard to resist free things, but if you like this at all get rid of it and get the real cs."
7720,i like it
7721,"It's decent, I guess. After you get through all the crashes, it's actually pretty good. But i still would recommend this game if you have paitence since it's very crashy and buggy sometimes"
7722,My dog can make a better game with better graphics than this...

I've been playing for a while now, and what I've found is the game is not just a game of chance, but also pretty much aimed to those willing to open up their wallet, I've put money into this game and got nothing, it lasts a week and bam, wasted money, the chance game really is annoying, the game itself is fun to play and I love putting hours into it, but it's just dissapointing that if you arent willing to spend a lot you won't get far quickly, I've been playing on and off for months now, I have 3 permanent items and over 20 with a date that'll expire, see my point yet?

I recommend playing it if you want something to pass the time 
I won't recommend if you wish to play it at all times, that's what I wanted but of course it just took so much time and well, sadly money"

7808,"Pretty good game, only problem like most zombie games where players can be turned into zombies in, the zombies are not only faster then you, but can easily turn you with 1 hit, i'd perfer it to be closer to the Ideal's of No More Room In Hell, where it takes multiple hits for a zombie to take you down or turn you, even if you were to add it as a bite that slowly kills you then turns you into a zombie with some sort of cure would be a great improvement of zombies vs humans PvP games."

I do not understand the reasoning for trying to kill mods that are basically cosmetic in nature, however companies do that. I understand that you guys want money, and have made game-relevent cosmetices for that.

However the moment that you added spyware into yourgame is the moment this one and the whole community really needs to uninstall.

7825,"Most people buy this because they can't afford or don't want to spend money to get Counter Strike Global Offensive. A lot of people say it's bad. Well compared to most games it's not the best, but if you consider it was based off of the earlier counter strikes I can under stand. To be honest it really reminds me of AVA but with zombies. I have CSGO and CSNZ isn' as good but it's still pretty fun and I would recommend this game."
7826,Like a shitty CS:S server mod but worse.

7853,"As a long time CS player since the 1.6 days, this abomination offends me.

Avoid this game at all costs, it's a clunky, broken piece of garbage that only wants your money. Don't even download it just for fun or drunken laughs, it won't even give you that.

The modes are horribly broken and unbalanced, just avoid entirely."

Just buy CS 1.6, and search for a zombie mode map to play.

-9001/10"
7892,"Updated on 18/12/2019
Really rarely does anyone come across a game that is as parasitic, rage-inducing and depressing than Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies (now changed to Studio)

Back in 2014 when I first started this game I was 11 and was just looking around for a free CS to play as I had much childhood memories from cs 1.6 and there it was...stating on the top of the list ""Counter-strike Nexon: Zombie,"" the game itself felt pretty average to me but it was the only thing I really could play. Some of the game-modes were really fun, my favorites were Zombie Escape, TDM and of course Zombie Hero, the community also gave birth to some of the greatest friendships in a virtual world and having them play with you days on end... it was addicting to say the least...and so, soon enough this game became a beautiful hobby that you could enable you to meet so many charming, interesting and wonderful people alongside fun game-modes that tested your ability to work together and had unique luck factors through loot-boxes (called 'Decoders' or Crafting System) that was a key factor to what made this game so appealing to my younger self, seeing all those people using those weapons and getting so much respect and recognition from using them in Zombie Modes, that's what pushed me to continue this game but this is where the biggest mistake in my childhood took place.

Over the years, I spend thousands of dollars on this game and thousands of hours farming and training myself to become better than what I was capable of (keep in mind I was only 12-15 years old at best) through it I adopted a ton of my favourite weapons, my most vivid memories are obtaining the AK-47 Paladin, M4A1 Dark Knight and Reaper, I remembering jumping up and down like a little lunatic and messaging all my friends shamelssly and it was satisfying to see the friends you made while also eventually surpassing them giving yourself the attention you so desperately wanted. But in time, due to the repetitive nature coupled with extreme lack of good content caused a major decline in the gameplay and the population...one by one more and more of my friends left the game leaving me all alone, which by itself sounds natural as it's exactly what happens to most games, they're popular, they're loved then they're forgotten. But what makes this feeling so surreal when playing this game in particular is that I and most other players never played it for the sport, it was always for bragging rights and having fun, and suddenly I fell into such a deep depression, because I had no idea how a game that once gave rise to so many hours of entertainment suddenly became so...empty, and that feeling got more concentrated with each passing day and t hat's when this game became so painful to log into, as even the greatest game-moderators such as BlindFire left the result...horrible patches that nobody cared much less played for and instead replaced with horrid power weapons that far surpassed its predecessors which prompted indeed more money saving. Everyday I was logging in trying to innovate in this imaginary world and neglecting reality and everyday the successes in this game felt more and more empty, until one day...everything was lost.

This game became increasingly unbearable as I had transitioned through over 4 families and seeing each one fall apart and break was just a foreshadow on what this game would become, and as I had to play on different servers because of the decrease in population I shifted from 130 ping straight into the 310 zone, as the North American servers became abandoned, then it occurred to me just how broken my life had become due to my unhealthy obsession, I was beginning to stop going to both friend and family events, my grades had dropped quite significantly and my other more positive hobbies such as music had become more distant, even worse is the appalling attitude that I had adopted from this game, I was essentially not even allowed to die without feeling infuriated and it's something I didn't want to feel, I've always wanted to just have fun, but the competition in this game is unlike any I've ever experienced and now ""casual-play"" is non-existent. My realization  and story may all seem like a copy-pasta or desperate attempt to attract sympathy from random people who come across it but (no offense) I honestly would not expect a random person and most likely....you..I don‚Äôt expect you to understand this level of insanity, this feeling of disgust and this amount of depression. 

Now that this game is already as its final stand, everything I worked for, everything I played for, everyone I shared the memories with, will have gone down the drain as people look at this game and wonder ""why on earth do people play this trash?"" And I don't blame them for thinking this as I indeed would ask the same thing in their shoes, but my biggest wish is to have never started this game, if I could go back in time I would have just skipped this game entirely, the influence this game has on its players is best described as ""parasitic"" 

This is a game that completely screwed up this particular section of my life and now only leaves me with depression and a bitter taste in my mouth as I can never get my money back, I can‚Äôt get my time back, I can‚Äôt get my wasted opportunities back...and ironically I can never get those golden moments back...but most importantly I cannot un-recommend this game enough to anyone because it's not just because this game is horrible. It's because it has the ability to affect you on a deeper level.
Take this review from a person who has spent more than 5 years wasted on trying to become something worthless and never try this game."
7893,"Garbage, CSCZ mods did a way better job back in 2008."
7894,"I honestly don't get why people hate it so much. It's got some great weapons and modes. The bad thing about it though, is that it isn't really counter strike."
7895,"Pay to Play, And I have NO clue on what in gods name is goin on with it now.

Edit after a year give or take: This was just a zombies in cs:s thing..? What is going on?"
7896,"you know when you go to the toilet, and sit on the white seat, that has hole in it? then you squeeze as hard as you can, but it's not poo, that comes out. It's this game."
7897,"Game crashed when i started it, too bad it stopped crashing after that"
7898,"CS + Zombies sounds interesting but in fact it's an awful F2P game that looks like old CS and plays
like a clone of L4D. Better play CS:GO and L4D and don't waste your time here ...

Oh and in fact their anti-cheat solution seems to be an illegal privacy violation. So 
simply put this game where it belongs - the trashcan of history

7941,its a fun game but counter strike global offencive is alot more fun but if your not allowed to buy that this is a perfect option!
7942,Its so cringy and anime that it maked me to put my shoe on my feet 9/11
7943,tis game sack a dick govno crached hate gaben nub
7944,"Fun first person shoot, has older graphics, but its free, so hey."
7945,I could be uninstalling this game for ever.
7946,Its Really good i enjoy it alot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7947,Meh...
7948,It is  very very addictive afteer you play for 32 hours lol XD
7949,ITS really bad bad bad bad abda
7950,It has XIGNCODE. If you dont know what XIGNCODE is then it is pretty much a program that scans your history from 48 hours.
7951,My Best GAME
7952,i can't quickscope 1/10

7954,not bad !!
7955,Love it!
7956,TROLL IS GAME YESH
7957,"awsome game for being free, you don't really even need a expensive graphics card, or i don't think. you don't need a high tech pc at all either. Runs around 60fps. And im inpressed. with decent graphics as well."
7958,"If you look past all the bizarre game modes and crappy microtransactions, the game is pretty much like CS 1.6 with extra maps."
7959,"Its like Orignal Counter-Strike with.....

-More guns

-New modes

- And its Free :D"
7960,Its a fun free to play pay to win version of CS 1.6 the death match servers are a bit BS and its just fun for a few hours
7961,I can not lange the game
7962,DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!!
7963,there are games which are better than this for free
7964,"Vlave CS is better , born game and shitty guns.
"
7965,Money grab game.
7966,"made me kill my whole family

10/10"
7967,This game is HORRIBLE and don't just keep scrolling it is like counterstrike BUT counterstrike should NOT be made into a zombie game. Whenyou get shot in nexon you can not move if you are a zombie...... if that isn't enought i don't know what is.
7968,They have to nerf the second zombie
7969,For people who don't have enough to buy cs:go. This game is a total knock off and is really bad. Buy cs:go and play the hundreds of zombie mods there instead. btw the community is even worse
7970,Gey.
7971,"I'm tired of this game and the problems it has, where shall I start? 
Campers: 
every time i try to have a good game on this heap of **** i end up on the server where everyone has to take advantage of the certain spots, the balcony for example, whats the point? it ruins the game for everyone else 
Overpowered players: 
I can't get near any player because the way the guns affect zombies is too powerful, you can't move when you get hit leaving you open to more gun fire 
Teamwork? 
whats the point of having a team when on the zombie escape mode they leave you behind? 
Glitches, 
zombies can infect me through walls now? 

although this game may sound appealing and it's from a well known series i wouldn't say download it, if you looking for a similar style go with codename cure, twice as much fun

7972,nice
7973,good game
7974,cdcdcdcdc
7975,Counter Strike: Global Offensive isn't that expensive.........
7976,BAD TOUCH! BAD TOUCH! STRANGER DANGER!
7977,"Its awesome
I like how the game is its just the graphics"
7978,I'd rather buy WinRar.
7979,"My relationship with Nexon is like a troubled mother + child one.
At the they baby-feed you with a spoon and give your all sorts of toys.
But then once you can walk, they give you a kick in the back and laugh as you violently faceplant the floor.
Yeah, that my friends, is Nexon."
7980,"the only real problem with this is that u could make this with gmod
"
7981,This game should does not exist
7982,it is bad dont play it
7983,super gay
7984,Yes I do recommend this game to anyone who's parents won't buy CS:GO! My friend and I started playing it its a bit repetative but it fine
7985,bust gume 420/666
7986,Biggest pile of wank shit i've ever seen in my fucking life.
7987,bad graphics
7988,This game is awesome 1M Stars!!!!!!
7989,"This game a F2P version of the old Counter Strike. Note: I've never played it but it still feels that way. Only for broke people, simply put."
7990,"This game is just a rip off the 1.6 , only original part of it is the modded weapons of which they offer for a price. There is 0 admin support and the game crashes so often it would take a true idiot to put any money into it. Not to mention the third party program that runs in the background doing god knows what. I would not play this game if you are looking for a game that is cs 1.6 but better because this is not it."
7991,this game is fun if u r in to zombies if u r then get the game and try it out
7992,"It's like Counter-Strike 1.6 but with shittier graphics, pay2play, zombies, and stupid maps.
But on the plus side, it comes with a free virus!

Pros:
Free
Zombies
Free Virus

Cons:
Outdated
Pay to Play
Zombies
Free Virus"
7993,10/10 would listen to soundtrack again
7994,No just no.
7995,LOL the game is sooooooooooo good i like his grafics try it its soooooooooo good :)
7996,"The video looked amazing for the game, but in reality, it just didn't seem to deliver what was anticipated to me. Sorry :/"
7997,Graphics are not the best but still a FUN Game
7998,"Muito foda, recomendo pra todos. Eu que nem gosto de 1.6 gostei do jogo mano !

7999,Free CS 1.6

8001,0/10 Garbage!
8002,it is epic with the thanatos weapons and balrog weapons zombies are fun as hell please play this wicked game of kill zombies or be killed by zombies or kill humans or be killed by humans dat is the resolution of this game and i highly reccomend it

8007,"It's one very good game to play when you are in home and don't have nothing to do,i realy liked!!"
8008,It's funny how much negative reviews are on this game just because of the graphics...oml. GROW UP.
8009,"if you like retro games, it's great. I got it to see what counterstrike was like, but I think I should just by the game. I really think it should just be a retro gaming thing, though."
8010,"this game requires you to sink a ridculus amount of hours into it in oreder to be able to truly play its not fun when your low level and have the basic equipment
"
8011,Yeah dude this games pretty fun!       - Donald Trump
8012,This game is very fun and  i think a lot of people that like a challenge should play this.
8013,I like this game. I dont even know why.
8014,10/10 would play again
8015,LOL! Fucking pathetic. Huehuehue.
8016,"This game has striked my social life

8026,"hello counter strike nexon zombies.
a lomg time ago there was the prize if you get enough piece of transcedence. 
if you get 888 piece of transcedence you choose M4A1 Darthnight or AK47 paladin.
I saw a video today then you need to use this and then you choose but i didn't knew this and i was have enough to choose one.
i will be very very happy if you give me one of them.

happy if you understand and i very like this game."
8027,"This game is fun, you can earn just about everything in the game by playing, you can craft new stuff from your low tier old stuff and recycle the guns and items you don't want to make new stuff. Like if you have a set amount of a low tier crafting item, you can combine them for 1 higher tier and continue that all the way to the top. No one should download this as a competitve shooter or even anything more than a mod for cs. Teamwork depends game to game and a family is pretty easy to find. Theres like 20 different modes to play too. Just try it, if your not one of those dicks that think only triple A's and Shite-Likes are games worth playing, and you dont take it seriously when you play. Then you will probably have fun. Welcome to video games."
8028,"[h1] WE WANT OLD CS:NZ [/h1]

[b] Some years ago (2015-2017), this game was better version of CS 1.6 with more weapons and modes to play. 
This was my second favourite game. Playing with friends and talking about new collected or crafted NORMAL weapons was amazing. Having Thompson, MG34, AW-50, etc... was epic. This was best thing in this game. You had to craft weapons that was not plasma guns and was BALANCED [/b]

[h1] What we have now? [/h1]

[b] Game after first Decoder update was playable and it was good. Some other weapons that was better than standard weapons wasnn't bad. Decoders was for free (you had just to play). but next updates destroyed this game. I stopped play this game, cuz im EUROPEAN player and I don't want to play Anime CS with cosmic guns that you need to pay for them.
I just joined to normal DM game and I was killed on spawn, by AWP with 20 ammo and 20x better accuracy.
They even deleted my account where I had 650 h played and many Euros spend. [/b]

[b] Don't make asian games for european gamers... [/b]

[u] We want old CSN:Z, not Korean shooter [/u]

8029,xoxooxox
8030,"There's a lot of things you need to get straight before you play this game. First being, the controls can be a little shoddy. More often than not, you'll find yourself having to click out of sniper scopes, or focus and unfocus because it doesn't undo that mechanic after you fire, and hit your target. I'm not sure why, but it sticks, and if there's a way to shut it off, I have yet  to find it. I wouldn't suggest playing with bots. Finding a lobby with anyone is better than using the bots. Connections can be a bit wonky as well. 
 
   Once you get past that, their selection of weapons is pretty good for people who are just starting, and if you know how to use them, they're helpful in the field. I'm still not sure if you can even customize the character you play as aesthetically, but since it's a Nexon game, you'll probably have to pay for it. 
 
   The maps. And game modes. There's a lot to choose from, but some of them are painfully similar to others, and they just make very small editations to a few of them to make them 'entirely different' play styles. But they're kind of the same. Though, team deathmatches are pretty fun. The zombies are kind of original. I've not seen anything like them, in any other kind of game. 

 This is my first game review, so I can't say it's a fantastic one in means of detail.. so I'll condense it.

  Pros: 
    
      - Good beginning weapon selection
      - Frequent log in rewards 
      - Original infected ideas.
      - Generously large maps.
      - Nicely implimented music, and ambiance (map varying)
      - Nice weapon SET selections.
      - Server/room specifications are fair and thorough

  Cons: 
     
      - OP bots *but usually, any and all bots are kind of OP.
      - Occassionally glitchy mechanics
      - Not very customizable.
      - Server search/find could be easier to navigate.
      

      6/10  Maybe 7 because it's FTP"
8031,"If you like a grind based p2w game where you struggle to get permant weapons unless you pockets are as deep as a crack addict's debt, then this game is perfect for you! Nexon strikes again with a title that will be sure to ruin your look on counter-strike."
8032,meow
8033,I Recommend This Game.
8034,"it's like 1,6 but for free it's old school type counter-strike if you are an fan of games like that play it then"
8035,Well not very good game....... But just for a litte banter !
8036,"Love the game. For the people who talk shit about it(people who play cs-go), you are just fan-boys. Not everyone has a $4,000 gaming pc. I have tried cs-go but my computer can't het over 20fps, even on the lowest settings. Plus I would rather play Call Of Duty that listen to people on cs-go call me a fucking hacker every time i get a kill. Atleast on here people are actually playing other than talking shit about how bad the other players are. Honestly Advanced Warfare is more playable than cs-go."
8037,horrible................
8038,This is a really good game if you are interested in shooters.
8039,Yeah Games is Good if do not have money
8040,this game is worse than airborne aids

8044,"If you like Counter-Strike 1.6 then you will love this, if you didn't like Counter-Strike 1.6 you will hate this. People saying its pay to win probably just suck, the free guns are some of the best, I've never purchased anything besides a female class and I'm pretty decent. Fun game if you like zombies and counter strike!!"
8045,"It's like those crappy games on the Play Store. Infected with ads, Pay2Win, and isn't fun to play at all. Except it took up 3GB, which is probably used for half the crap they advertise the guns with. You should only reccomend this game to play a sick joke on your friends; a joke that I fell for.

The gameplay is mediocre, at best. Nothing you would get from CS1.6, the game this is based upon. To top it all off, you get a faux Quake announcer. Nothing screams half assed and no effort like a Quake Announcer!"
8046,Its pretty fun actualy but hard to get use to
8047,"This Game Is so fun, just try it out and you might like it."
8048,"I tricked 5 people into downloading this. It was the funniest thing that ever happened. Sadly, I have no more friends but hey, it was worth it."
8049,"A typical ""pay to win"" game. Even if you spend money, the pay back is generally disappointed."
8050,Not at all related to the other counter-strikes.

8054,not the best game
8055,I thought i would give this game a try and i did...the worst game i have ever played in my life.
8056,Nice but needs alot of work!
8057,This game its good
8058,Weird How Everyone Judging This Game. It Gives You The Old Counter Strike For Free And You Can Play The Zombies One If Ya Want. Also Adds Weird Guns... Some Odd Sounds For Zombies.
8059,"Have you ever wanted to live in galaxy capable of fulfilling your greatest desires? Do your greatest desires include phrases tha can be summed up with the words: ""Rotisserie Chicken Humanoids""? If so this game will provide you pleasures beyond the mortal coil. In this pulse pounding adventure you take the reins of Grandpa Whistlefist on his endless journey to discover what makes chesterfield cigarettes so remarkably bad. Along his way he befriends many colorful characters but when it comes right down to it we don't give a gosh diddly darn about them. What we really want to know is how Grandpa Whistlefist is going to figure out the mysteries and if he'll win the hand of his refridgerator love. Spoiler alert, during the second part of this game there is an abrupt shift to the perspective of a professional stock underwriter named Feliz. Honestly during my time playing as Feliz I felt more emotions than I knew that a human could feel. His struggles to understand which stocks needed to be underwritten, in addition to the pain of wondering what tomorrow's sandwich special would be, brougnt me to my knees oftentimes. Sometimes though it takes a strong man to admit that life's struggles are both bitter and sweet, and the realization of fault is often as invaluable as the joy of success. Will your hands shake as you hold the sceptor of absolute glory. having crushed the foe beneath your boot and strode beneath the sunrays of reprieve? Not sure where I was going with that last bit, seemed nice though. Anway this game is really quite bad. I wouldn't play it."
8060,Still can't figure out how to play.

8063,"I can say i like this game,maybe you have to work on some bugs and that would be it.
Graphics are like an 90's so dont think its CSGO level ;)"
8064,I wouldent say its the worlds best game or Even CS but if you know only have f2p games then this is worth pickin up
8065,basically gave me chronic ebola
8066,"This game was once a mod for CS 1.6, and it hasn't aged well. You might as well play the zombie escape community-created mod (if you look hard enough) in CSGO than play this unbalanced game."
8067,"honestly, its ok, but if you have any money on you right now, you should be looking at the csgo download page."
8068,"ALl host are from south america  in North America server causes all NA player 200ping rather than 20-40 ping normally.

8069,"The only reason this game gets a No is because is pay2win, otherwise the game is fun."
8070,Worth a try. Not great tho.
8071,awesome game loves the way the zombies look

"
8073,"The game is AWESOME, its really fun but the graphics could be better. but overall I would recommend getting this game :D"
8074,its ok
8075,I think there should be a ping limit on servers because there is to much lag. Lets say a host that has a good ping leaves then the room host gets passed to a lagger causing everyone to suffer lag. My ping is low and i run smoothly with out any problems but as soon as a lagger becomes host then the whole gaming experience. i want to be able to stop any one with high pings from coming into a server. PLEASE PLEASE HELP i think this game is good but laggers are a big issue!!!!!!
8076,This game made me feel nauseous. I'm sorry but its so bad.
8077,very very bad but hey its free so why am i complaining
8078,"its not bad,i like it
"
8079,"""This is like CS 1.6 with mods, but these mods a little ruining the game.""

This is comment to this game that I created some time ago.
In 2020 I tried once again. First what is good about this game:
+ It's free to play
+ There is ""Studio"" where you can create maps, gamemodes and it could be easy to learn
And that's it, now few cons:
- as I said earlier, it's like CS 1.6 with ton of mods: Zombies, creazy weapons, weird lowpoly charcters, what is making this game a mess
- not many players, only on classic mode like classic CS (S&D)

In conclusion:
Play Original CS 1.6"
8080,yes!I now this is not a new game but it verry good!
8081,its good
8082,"The trailer is better than the game, sadly...
That's all I have to say. I would write a full review of the game, but I don't think it's worthy of that.  Plenty of people have already spoke my opinion. If you want to play a good Counter-Strike game, just play Source or Global Offense."
8083,Server is so laggy and unstable. Game contents is all about purchasing items. i wouldn't recommend this game

Pitting Terrorists VS Counter-Terrorists, players face off to complete their objective in round-based combat. Fast paced action blends with precise, tactical strategy to make for a warzone that anyone can pick up and lets the pros rise to the top.

This game went from a decent fps game to the textbook definition of pay to win trans. decoders ruined everything thanatos weapons made being a zombie useless and guns like the cyclone and savary made tdm games unfair and unbalanced and now with the runebreaker and premium top50 decoders people who pay have a astronomically higher advantage then those who dont.

8123,This is a very good and funny game
8124,"Positive side:
-Free to play
-A free Counter-Strike: Condition Zero
-A few new free guns(A Few ofc)
-A lot of gamemodes
-A lot of horror and cool effects on characters and in maps' visuals
-Free gifts(weaps etc in Xmas events or valentine etc)
Negative side:
It's a sh.it pay 2 win sh.itty sh.itted shi.t game, pay real money to change your nickname? really? are we a president to pay a lot of money in just ""A GAME""? are we that rich? the damn guy comes in the room and says ""anyone pro here?"" he said it as if he is the best pro player on the planet and what? he bought a nice f.king new pay 2 win gun and character and sh.its like that and says ""IM A PRO NI.GGA"".
I liked this game so much, so much and again SO MUCH but damn you Nexon, you can't even have a good anti-cheat, a f.king b.astard hacks and when we find out he kicks us, hey nexon, you wanna edit Valve's game? you can't, why? cuz you suck at editing, get out of here punk."

8151,"Wierd menus, gameplay looks like old doom. Not sure what to think, not great."
8152,CS Nexon is a example of a modded CS 1.6 with many weapons and characters to choose from. I recommend this game not only for the CS lovers but the Casual/Pro Survival Zombie players out there too.
8153,"This game is like masturbating to Hentai, only on the off times with sandpaper. SOMETIMES IT GOES WELL, SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T!"

8185,The worst game on steam.

8224,really good game but a little challenging
8225,"When I first saw this game I saw the reviews and thought it would be terrible. I hads never downloaded anything below an 85% and was a little worried. But no, this game is great and should be in any new comer to steam forums library as it is both free and fun. ( another free game i'd recommend is tf2)"
8226,GG

10/10 would s*** on again"
8239,I cried.
8240,There is not a single american playing this game. All mexican coke babies and europeans. Terrible and broken all over the place. Just a retarted counter-strike esk zombie grinder. I played this for a while thought is it was great at first but in the long run it is a waste of time and frustration. I got so mad at mexicans I almost voted for trump.
8241,Counter-Strike: Zombie Survival
8242,"This games makes me want drick bleach but, put it up my ass."
8243,"Honestly, Day One: Garry's Incident doesn't look so bad now. Neither does drinking bleach..."
8244,The trailer is good but game is sh*t
8245,"It's a perfect example of stereotypical FPS shooter from 1990, with many weapons and gamemods. Lots of interesting gamemodes, everyone are playing only gun deathmatch anyway.
Sound is at levels comparable to that of a space rocket launch.
Lots of maps, everyone choose to play Dust 2 only anyway."
8246,This game is super addicting and super fun. large community for hours of entertainment!
8247,"shit!!!

8248,420/69 would bl4z3 d4nk w33d agin
8249,"Because my computers too shitty to run Counter Strike: Global Offensive, this will have to do, Its Counter Strike: Nexon Zombies for PC. CS:NZ is a fun but old FPS it feels like the original Counter Strike, but with kind of better graphics. Like i said its alot like the original CS with most of the same gamemodes, the only difference is... well.... zombies, in my opinion this is the worst edtion to the game. Heres why: Being a zombie sucks, when your a zombie its very hard to kill enemy players, the rounds last like 2 minutes, its very lazily scripted, the zombie types suck, etc. If you couldve guessed stay away from zombies, i would stick to regular mode. If you cant afford Counter Strike or your computer cant run CS:GO just get this, its pretty much the original CS with a new title slapped on it and a new gamemode, it should have just been a free DLC. Overall its a pretty good game, i would give it a 6 out of 10."
8250,"Well what to say.....

I loaded this up with the hopes of having a little nostalgia trip....

I was expecting a CS with zombies....

Instead I got Paris Hilton trying to solve a quadratic equation  with a double ended dildo.

The loadscreen was unusual, it starts of in the right hand corner and then it would appear to be some ""freeium"" (*latin for not really) screen.

Eventually when I got into the game it would be too fast, i.e. not enough time on weapon choices and I spend 30 seconds as a human.

Now I'm a zombie, woopie doo....

Not much I can do other then to charge wildly at incoming fire whilst frailing my hands.... at least I have plenty of health.

To be honest this is a game for one of those South Korean Starcraft fans.  No tatics, repetive gameplay and some annoying voice constantly droning on... its about as exciting as the Labour Party's Ed stone of promices.

My advice.... well I'd say premature hair loss is more exciting.

*Edit*

Nexon... this is the gaming equivalent of George Lucas and Stephen Spielberg raping Indiana Jones in that ‚ÄúForth Movie‚Äù"

Cons: You don't know what anything in coutner-strike is anymore.

8260,uh its a free to play garage version of 1.6.
8261,luv it
8262,Good Game but its to hard to kill zombies.
8263,"good game reccomend downloading it

8354,This is the worst game I've ever played hands down. Hell I'd rather go buy Starforge and regret my purchase than play this.
8355,gud game 10/10
8356,oh yah i didnt even play this game lmao i was on the menu for an hour. brb uninstall
8357,"This game redefines what a bad game should be like.

A great study case for any game designers out there interested in coop/versus fps games."
8358,yeee boy:___-___-
8359,DON'T PLAY THIS GAME....
8360,"I Need help,
wtf is this game?
zombies in cs? 

swag/10 -ign"
8361,There are so many better free fps games available. Just try something else.
8362,:o
8363,dont play this its a pay2win  and the community its bad
8364,"A very good counter-strike good for bad computers i recommand having a computer with at least 2-3 ram so ya this game is one of my favorite Counter-Strikes and is have good gamemode's and its just A game you can really mess around with your freinds so yep I defflently recommand it to all people who like COD,Counter-Strike,Half Life,Half Life 2,Gmod,Minecraft.roblox,DayZ,Arma 2,Arma 3,DayZ Mod and Unturned."
8365,"Yes this game is kinda bad, but for a free game, it is an ok time killer."
8366,"I like it, But I hate it. It's like old CS but yet it's bad. Try it!"
8367,This is probably my favorite game even though you get op guns at the start. i srsly got a Balrog VII when i started
8368,The game was fun for a little bit when i couldn't get CS:GO but after a while its not worth playing if you have the nactual CS games. But the one good thing is this was the game that got me into counter strike.
8369,"got my new pc...went to try the game  for the first time in my life and the first thing that came on when i started the game ""Disconected by the GM beacause Cheating/Hacking""...""Connection was terminated please restart the game""

But i have played game on my friends pc and its kinda awesome...they need to fix this problem i really want to play .-."
8370,"Team Deathmatch is awesome - grreat maps.  If you like FPS, this is top notch."
8371,"I played this game for less than an hour, and I would recommend it to the people who:
-Want to have weapon/character skins in a CS game but can't afford/don't want to pay for CS:GO
-Simply want to play CS 1.6 in a classic gamemode like bomb defusal, hostage rescue etc. but, again, can't afford/don't want to pay for CS 1.6/GO
-Want to play a zombie game and don't care about it's weird menus/visuals/soundtrack

And I wouldn't recommend it to the people who:
-Care about graphics (I know that this game is based on CS 1.6 and that it uses the outdated GoldSrc game engine)
-Want to have a great zombie fighting experience (in my opinion it needs some work)

  PROS
-Has a classic gamemode which allows you to basically play CS 1.6 but for free.
-The zombie models and textures are pretty well made.
-It's FREE.
-It's not a P2W game.

 CONS
-Zombie modes are pretty bad: To win as a human you only need to get the whole team to sit in a corner and fire at the zombies, as getting shot as a zombie slows you down a little too much.
-The game engine is outdated: The developers should have made the game based on CS:S as its game engine is newer and better.
-As I mentioned, the game menus are pretty messed up.

I would rate it 5/10, needs a lot of improvements."
8372,"Has a ton of negative ratings but honestly, although only playing it for 45 minutes as of right now, I'd have to say this game is addicting."
8373,"The game is ok, but look at all the other free games. Trust me, when you picked CSN:Z, you made the wrong choice."
8374,Love the game great for low spec computers
8375,good gameplay except the fact that you have to play on asian servers (most part of the servers)
8376,This is like strangling a kid with a penguin penis while drowning in your own piss -10/10
8377,"Why does this exist?

Very poor game. 0/10"
8378,Good game you should try iR
8379,"an epic game, but still needs to be less pay to win, with this game, in all these hours i just had some of my best moments in Counter Strike, this is by far my favourite CS game of the entire series. Thank you for reading this comment."
8380,Strongly NOT recommend it.I have no idea what is this game not similar to any counter strike and it's made from inactive bad developers.
8381,"Absolutely terrible. The ""tutorial"" modes don't tell you anything, so I guess you already need to be 100% experienced with counterstrike games to play this, or go read a manual. Graphics suck, engine sucks, everything seems like it was made 15 years ago. Not even fun, nothing is explained, and you can't even make it to the main menu without all the pay2win crap getting shived in your face. You haven't even learned the controls and your already being offered all the premium content and bonuses. Not even worth 10 minutes of my time, deleted."
8382,"My favorite experience from playing this masterpiece was uninstalling it.

10/10"
8383,Even cod is better then this shit
8384,"Um CS zombie mod, s√≥ que standalone, com skins bizarras e armas P2W"
8385,"Gutes Spiel, zumindest wenn man cs 1.6 lieber mag als cs:go. Die Zombie Modi sind allerdings ein witz, wenn man unbedingt Untote schnetzeln will, sollte man lieber zu Dead Island oder Left 4 Dead oder √§hnlichem greifen. Mit Freunden gut spielbar, auch gegen Randoms zeitweise durchaus unterhaltsam. Allerdings w√§re es sehr nett, wenn irgendjemand etwas gegen dieses erm√ºdende CT-Spawn campen auf dust_2 oder das T-Spawn campen auf Assault im Team Deathmatch unternehmen w√ºrde. Entweder man wird nach Ablauf des Respawnschilds von 4 Gegnern gleichzeitig umgem√§ht, oder man l√§uft √ºber eine g√§hnend leere Map und bekommt keinen einzigen Kill. Ich wei√ü nicht ob da Balancetechnisch was zu machen ist, w√§re aber sehr sch√∂n. Sonst ist n√§mlich keiner der beiden R√§ume oberhalb von 20 Spielern vern√ºnftig spielbar, weil so oder so hinter einem der Spawns gef√ºhlte 30 Mann mit einer One-shot Waffe hinter der n√§chsten Wand geiert.
( 8/10 )"
8386,spyware
8387,"The game was fun but now its terrible.
It be fun if nexon and valve made like a zombies mode for CS:GO or whatever.
This game gave my old computer a blue screen even though i had the right requirements for it.
The game is just broken. Even some cheats in the game killed it instantly.
Counter strike is a good game but this one is just not good."
8388,awsome game
8389,Wtf was that....
8390,no
8391,"Hello, If you‚Äôve read my serious reviews in the past, you know that I have a general format with it, but now I am updating it and will be updating my other serious reviews to use the new format. This new format will have different categories weighed differently depending on what type of game it is

Gameplay: 5/10*5 25pts/50pts
CSNS is very much a love it or you‚Äôll hate it kinda game. There are some pretty interesting modes with their one lore for each of them. For most of the Zombie Modes, you have a point, shoot, kill the zombie kind of thing, for some of them it is largely escaping from the zombie, and there‚Äôs even one where you have to defend a base against a horde of them.

Story: 5/10*2 ‚Äì 10pts/20pts
The story is kinda hard to make out, but involves the research of Dr. Rex going wrong. Not really going to say much more since I don‚Äôt want to spoil it

Graphics: 3/10*1 3pts/10pts
Looks like a game from the 90s, but with a console command you can slightly increase texture quality. It is hardly surprising, though since most of the textures of are taken from CS 1.6 and CS:CZ

Mechanics and Controls: 7.5/10*4 30/40pts
The game ads a huge variety of new weapons on top of the regular ones found in Counter-Strike, including ones that do not fit into any category

Value: 2/10*3 6/30pts
The game was always p2w, however depending on the timeframe that you look at, by how much so differs. From the games release to Late 2015, It was relatively mild, and with a moderate amount of grinding you could find yourself doing pretty good. From Late 2015 to Early 2017, the pay-to-win part of the game revealed it‚Äôs self in more detail. In early 2017, the first version of the decoder system we know as it is right now was dropped and for a brief period of time, it reverted to it‚Äôs first Release ‚Äì Late 2015 status, however, would be followed up by the most pay to win era of it‚Äôs history. During the majority of 2017, CSNS would be extremely pay to win. Sometime in 2018, Nexon started offering better weapons to new players and would consistently do that, and such it is less p2w today. While that seems fine, the amount of money some people have burned on this game, leave for a couple of years, only for a new player to have better weapons can seem infuriating. 

Overall: 4.9/10 74/150pts
This was a game I played for so long, that I feel like I‚Äôve seen everything. Yet I‚Äôve also been inactive on it for so long that I‚Äôve seen nothing. Nexon is a p2w, money hungry company, and this game is the embodiment of f2p p2w games. Many people have sunk thousands of hours, spent tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars on this game and has a habit for pissing off long time players (for example, removing the zombie evolution system, which I spent countless hours farming) so please, Don‚Äôt get this game. If you do, make it a casual game you play every once and a while. Your bank account, and your sanity will thank you.

[Updated from last review made in January 2018 with ~2,062H at review time]"
8392,Not as good as CSGO but still a decent f2p version of it
8393,this game sucks
8394,Good for people that are in to the cs franchise and zombie games
8395,"If you like a zombie game combined with a oldschool game, this is for you!If you don't have a very good PC play this."
8396,"im just passin time by this game is god for wasting time not bad idea but not good stand alone game should be added to cs-go
"
8397,As a counter-strike 1.6 player i like this game.
8398,Leaves a key logger after closing. To bad I loved the game but I had to unistall because I have spent many hours on my club penguin and runescape.
8399,Could of been better.
8400,"Don't take my assessment seriously, I DON'T recommend this game. However, I liked this game and still like to this day just because of the one thing: F U N. Yeah, I'm absolutely serious. Even though this game is a garbage dump which is extremely unbalanced and ready to suck all the money out of you (thanks to Nexon). I just LOVE these exclusive things of this game that make this game fun: many, many game modes (especially for a shooter game), —Åool and overly exaggerated weapons in every sense, zombies, a lot of blood when you shoot zombies, that makes the game for me. Have you heard some of the Announcer voice lines? When I hear them, it's like I'm back in the days of Unreal Tournament, where there was just an amazing voice-over announcer for every kill of an opponent! I love this game, but also hate it to death because of the things I said earlier, so if you want to play this - play, but I don't recommend this game."
8401,P2W. Bugs. Lag
8402,yes !
8403,game sucks can not connect to servers  steam blames your computer. when should blame them selves. only worry about updating stupid costumes and guns instead of actual game play would not recommend this game.  steam needs to update their crap servers
8404,Crap lol
8405,"Great Game,its gives you option of co-op or classic csgo mutiplayer :D i like this game 
"
8406,shit
8407,"lol so much fun itr could use a little work on some of the bugs i have fallen out of the map a few trimes
"
8408,"good game
"
8409,"Right, so, Ill be blunt, off the bat. This game doesnt have a great community. It has heavily dated graphics, and at times has a frame rate of 1fps on even a high end system. However, for a free game, it plays pretty damn well. When the game isnt lagging, I have minimal issues with preformace. It also adds a lot to the original CS game that it trys so hard to be. So, in the event of TLDR, heres the breakdown

Pros: Free
         Doesnt play terribly
        Easy to find a game at any given time
         Though progressing (aqquiring items) takes a while, it is never unfair
         Not too pay to win

Cons: Will drop frames drastically and randomly
          The community is fairly terrible, and in the case of the NA servers, speaks mostly spanish
          It takes a good long while for any items you aqquire to end up as permanent.
           Some weapons are rather broken, as some buy only weapons are incredibly strong.


If you want something for free, then snag it up, since it isnt half bad.

8412,Not even playable now.
8413,"Would Recommend this game to anyone that likes fast-paced games with alot of different modes to choose from such as Team Deathmatch to Zombie Scenario to Human Scenario but this game comes with a few off-putting glitches: Sometimes when i've been playing other games then come to CSN:Z (Counter-Strike Nexon Zombies) to play a round or two i find that the whole GUI is flashing rapidly along with some ingame objects (Crates, Ladders) once i close my computer down for about 30 minutes its gone but honestly i'm not sure weather its my computer's GPU or the game.

Would Still Recommend it, just be prepared for time consumption."

8454,Feeling the old times when playing this game...
8455,NO GOD PLEASE NO NO NOOOOOOOOO
8456,.
8457,Graphics are not great and you get the feeling that you need to purchase ingame
8458,Its good cause its free.
8459,"why did i think this was good
we're lucky its f2p"
8460,n
8461,"Game is great even though, it may have its moments when it frustrates the player. Would recomend this game nine out of 10. Besides the quality and state that its in for FREE. I'll take what i can get besides, their is a wide variety of gamemodes. Only thing i wish is that i had more friends to play this game with me.Just make sure you can run the game if you dont have the required minimum for any game needless to say that game will run like crap or not run at all.Over all nine out of ten. I would and do recommend this game."
8462,Great god damn game doesn't matter what anybody else says this game is great it might not be very polished or super well made or anything but it's fun as hell.
8463,What the hell is this?
8464,"suspiciously overbearing mother: I looked at reviews for that a long time ago and half of them were saying like ""doesn't run well"" or something

Bush did 9/11 no this game did 9/11
"
8475,"okay so this game... its okay but if you like graphics dont get it
dont play this by your self it can get realy boring but with friends its fun i just wish some of the game mode were easier if played with less people some were unplayble because the enemy team were that op (im refering to some of the zombie modes) the ai are alright but some game modes there stupid we played zombie ai or bots (cant remember what its called) and they didnt see us for the hole time
for my full rating i would say a 6 it wasnt bad but wasnt that good."
8476,CS Nexon Zombies
8477,This is a FUCKTARD game....
8478,I realy dont get alot of the negitive reviews sure its pay to win but you get alot of things like maps free its not like when quake live was free to play and they charge you for maps i think this is a fun free to play fps
8479,"I almost fell alseep playing what is considered the most fun gamemode. An acquired taste, and, if you're poor, probably better than nothing...... probably."
8480,"This game fucking sucks, but sucks in a good way. I only like the zombie mode, and even then it's a pretty short lived ammount of fun. Only reccomend if you are really that bored."
8481,"Its not a pay to win...

Its a pay to fit in..."
8482,nice
8483,I don't like this game...
8484,no
8485,This is good game!!!!!
8486,"Play This Game , Funny 10/10, Multiplayer with Friends 10/10 , Fast EXP, Nice Weapons and MORE!"
8487,10/10/10/10/10
8488,"its a good game but it is real time consuming if you want really good weapons or you could buy some dlc's for faster leveling up and those level gifts you get when you reach a random level, and yes I have bad grammar please hate this coment as much ass possible, PEACE!!"
8489,It's counter stike: JAPANESE EDITION HOO HOO
8490,If you liked CS 1.6 then you will like this game. It has the nostalgia of 1.6 with the bonus of zombie game modes. If you want a real zombie experience do not download. It is not realistic compared to many other zombie styled games but id say thats the point. Overall it is a good game to hop on and kill some time.
8491,this game is so awesome! but theres problem about servers... Connection problem servers.... but it can fix.. it fix self if i start but dont worry this is awesome game
8492,"Buy CS:GO.

Don't ask your friends to play this game.
You get unfriended.
Friends suck, anyway."
8493,Meh
8494,this game sucks dick
8495,"Honest to God, I tried the game and I didn't like it that much. You might as well pay a small, nominal fee for CS1.6, CS:S, or CS:GO and play Zombie mode in those games.

Furthermore, there are a lot of other great games out there (F2P or not) that offer Zombie Mode that isn't frustrating as fuck. You see, Ivan, classic Zombie Mode is a 1 hit kill scenario. Once you get slashed, you're infected and turned into a zombie until the next round starts. There are barely any good camping spots in this game.

Most games with Zombie mode have horrible camping spots, resulting in 10:1 win ration for zombies.

And this is Nexon we're talking about. God knows what kind of OP weapons they dish out that cost real money. I used to play a game called ""Crossfire"" by Smilegate and God, that game is ruined because they recently carried $100 weapons with ""godly powers."" It's no different from aimbotting lol.

A game like CS:Z is made for poor, 2nd or 3rd world countries that can't afford good computers like most of us do here in the West. Thus, this is the reason why such a shitty game exists.

[b]Final verdict:[/b] Avoid this game and try other games like Warface for example."
8496,"Very good game, Fun to play with friends! Would rate 9/10!
"
8497,"They just want your money.
-10/10"
8498,"P2W not typically counter strike style.Gameplay 7/10 intresting modes mixed with classic counter strike's fashion and gameplay style.

8499,just awful.. waste of bloody time! Breaking my ankle was more eventful than this...
8500,theres zombies and CS and sometimes they even mix!
8501,"grafix r not gud*joke*
Good game for free"
8502,Detected by Black Cipher 2 ... FUCK THIS GAME
8503,"This game doesnt look THAT good, But still is a load  of fun. Atleast it starts you off with a decent weapon. I give this game a 9 thumps up out of 10."
8504,Please don't buy this game... JUST DON'T.. All the good reviews are trolls. This game should be gunned down to the face and get erased from existance. Please I'd rather shave my hair off then play this garbage game.
8505,"fantastic game! even better with friends. pretty much anyone's computer will be able to play this, not a demanding game at all."
8506,My first review.. this game sucks
8507,Fucking Aids
8508,"If there were more english players it would be soo much more fun
"
8509,i have one thing to say: HORRIBLE
8510,Good game
8511,"CS 1.6 with much, much more.
Highly recommend it, all of the negative reviews are just poking fun at the games but in actual fact most of the people who write those reviews have like 0.1 hrs on the game
It is not pay-to-win,
You get like 10 welcoming back packages with weapons, and maeterials to craft more weapons with, it's awesome!
Highly recommend it once again, ignore all the hate and try it yourself

8/10"

8514,lol
8515,im gay af
8516,"Most fun uninstall button I have seen. Game has potention and would be fun if there was a wave mode (like call of duty) or a objectives mode (like L4D2). This game does look good, and it is, but it lacks in the game modes."
8517,It's not Counter-Strike...
8518,its ok for being free
8519,idk why give it a yes but its feels good to play 1.6 still in 2020
8520,"Good for someone who wants to get familiarized with the Counter-Srtike style of games, but not willing to pay for one."
8521,"it's just no i would recommend not download at all 
"
8522,spoko
8523,I'm glad i tried this because now i know that i'm not missing out on anything. You're better off playing Left 4 Dead (2) or No More Room in Hell.
8524,Good Game :D
8525,"Congratulations, I managed to break the game in 50 minutes flat. I spent the entire time trying to buy a weapon, and couldn't, the moment I figured out how to, it crashes. I try to start up the game several times to no avail. I was glad, the zombies all 1 shot every human and the zombies are bullet sponges, usually taking a couple hundred bullets to fell even the ""weakest"" zombie. On top of that, the weapons you make are limited time only, and dont really help in the long run. So would you play a game where the humans get to difficult to reach spots and the zombies attempting to follow them while being bullet sponges? I would hope not."
8526,this game sucks mega decks
8527,"We all downloaded this because we're all to f***ing poor to buy Global Offensive

8530,"can't play, displays the message 'this game requires steam', even though that's the platform im using to play it"
8531,Just mindless firing around...
8532,"(Sorry if I don't know how to spell things)
Playing this kind of CS I've experinced 
-Rage
-Laughter
-Happiness from getting permanent Items
-Panic from Zombie Escape
-Rage even more
-Time Killing crafting
-Zombie Farming for points
-Lots of more Raging
-Friends
If you enjoy grinding your time away sure pick it up it will come with a price telling you
now there is no fair balance you get matched with whoever even ever games great when looking
for something free to spend time on and if spent well you don't have to pay a single cent for good
loot well, I think i covered enough on here so back to raging, and see you on the flip side."
8533,"This game is just a bad recreation of mutation mode from a game called crossfire that you can get from z8 games that has a much larger variety of game modes then just mutation or so called zombie mode. it also has very poorly reskined maps from counterstrike, the graphics are bad and its not even worth the space"
8534,Good game i like iti thought this was gonna be a bad game till i cheack it out. Never juged a book by its cover.
8535,"If you only have play cs 1.6, this is the next level and you gonna love it!"
8536,"Good enough, but to many problems with the server, this server error, came 1/2x a week and can't be online for a freaking week/month, so the publish a unfinished game, and in some of the rooms, you got to much laggs, thatyou can't even play, because you have a good internet connection, and a fast game pc, otherways i like the game really much, thats why i give a thumb up, but they need to work on their server errors, that REALLY annoying man..."
8537,its insanly boring
8538,Uninteresting but may be fun for someone looking to kill few hours.
8539,I got in a game looked at my screen never got in another game
8540,No
8541,Good Game
8542,not worth downloading
8543,"No info or tutorial on how to play and guns only last awhile before you need to get new ones, otherwise this game would be fun."

asking money to change the nickname is just dumb"
8545,"its a shit game
"
8546,Good
8547,"Basically extremely unbalanced CSGO or CS Source for people too cheap to spend a couple bucks on a great game.... oh wait a second who am I kidding after that CSGO revolver update its basically the same thing just cheap CSGO

lel jokes about CSGO being unbalanced are funny
9/11 would play again"
8548,"In my opinion I like this game, The zombie part of the game I dont like but then there is the online matches. They are why I play the game. It just feels smooth.
If you like 1.6 then you will probably like this game.
6.5/10 :)
"
8549,I couldn't even play the tutorial. Right off everyone around me is jumping up short ledges that I can't jump on for some reason. Then the zombies show up and after shooting one about 34 times it grazed my shoulder and I instantly turned into a zombie myself. I then walked around super slow while soaking up more bullets than a Texas firing range. At least the games flaws were apparent right off the bat so I didn't have to waste too much time on it.
8550,"Menus are completely useless, absolutely no tutorials, and apparently no way to play alone with bots (Survival).


Oh, and when I tried to host a game, the damn thing kept crashing. 


DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS LOAD OF SHIT! GO PLAY THE ORIGINAL COUNTER-STRIKE INSTEAD!"
8551,"Literally me and every player walking was like my character was on speed, and I got called a hacker by a bunch of mexicans speaking spanish at me for it. I can run CS, CS:S, and CS:GO perfectly fine, this game? It runs like shit and I don't even know how that's possible."
8552,.
8553,free thumb up :|
8554,"I think the project has succeeded in part , but the game modes are quite confused , the models are a bit repetitive. On the good side we have the creation of weapons, and fun with friends on multiplayer. They should add weapons and equipment and adjust the procedures for equlibrarle. I hope that in the future this game surprises me."
8555,Don't even think about it..

8563,"This is game is trash, It was just a hassle to start it up, plus the graphics and options in the game really sucked. I would recomend this to people who want to play a crap version of cs:go"
8564,Counter strike 1.6 its better than this rubbish.
8565,"ths game is da shit. its a really good nub simulator with a variety of nub destroyer guns. i recomend it to all the pros and nubs.i rate this 420/21







MY REAL REVIEW: i like this game because it is pretty much a free counter strike 1.6 but with zombies. i rather play this game 24/7 instead of cod bo1 bo2 and bo3 on ps4. i rate this 10/10."
8566,is good game
8567,"how can you turn the cs 1.6 engine into a horrid, clunky, and over the top generic free to play fps game? well counter-strike nexon: zombies is your answer. its like a game you'd find in a bootleg martket stall in hong kong."
8568,"You  know, this game could have been good if it wasnt for Nexon desperately trying to fix things that werent even broken to begin with, and of course adding even more unbalancing to the game, introducing even more pay to win weapons, adding a useless matchmaking system nobody asked for and conveniently hid the server browser among others but oh boy, this was just the tip of the iceberg...


Last month there was a migration to Nexon Korea and all players were asked to basically accept the transfer and all that , which I also did (supposedly i did), otherwise our account and progress/items would get removed due to the transfer.. 

Now low and behold, when i tried to get back to the game, turns out that even though I did what the announcement asked me to do: i lost every progress I made during those 98 or so played hours, including all of my perms and rank. Yay...

Im just glad i havent wasted too much real life money on the flaming trainwreck that this game has become, if anything it was a wake up call to jump the ship. I really dont want to sound like a hater but Nexon, yet, again, succesfully proved as to why they are among the most disliked/hated f2p games publishers by not even bothering to fix things people constantly beg them to and instead continue to do f-all.

If you like the game in its current state: good for you, but this was pretty much the point when I got fed up."

8576,"Free 1.6 plus zombies. Enough said.

Nope, I'm saying even more. The new gamemode itself is fun with all the classes, abilities and weapons. The zombies gamemode is addicting. Trust me. The graphics and voice acting could have improved but that didn't bother me much. Aside from zombies, you can play normal 1.6 too. Why are there so many bad reviews for this game? I'ts free!

9.5/10

I hope you enjoyed my review and found it helpful!"
8577,"Pretty cool zombie game,it may be buggy and glitchey but is free so its pretty cool.

8580,good game :D
8581,no. just.. no.
8582,"Well, I didn't play this game a lot but I can easily tell you that i do not recommend it in any case. Buy CS:GO for -50% and you will be happy in the rest of your life. You dont have to get weapons for real money to be OP and you can deal with other gold noobs to. The biggest problem is that the game's system feels so bad. The only good idea (from my personal experience) is the zombie mode but as everything else this also needs to be worked on."
8583,"Very Great game with ok graphics
"
8584,"A free game is still free and I'll still pllay it because of such, but darn it Nexon. Is there anything that can quench your lust for cash?"

8606,"its sa ying that i need steam  i am on staem
"
8607,"Im all about nostalgia and this has plenty of it. Almost all maps are from counterstrike 1.6 with condition zero skins . I guess that could be a turn off for most people, but i can play this on any crap computer and start playing. It has a decent amount of people who play so finding a match wont be hard. You dont necessarily have to pay to win, but you wont have all the nice toys that eveyone has up front (Especially that dang Headshot stick). There are a good amount of opportunities  to craft and earn items though. 

If you want a map to start off of and play go for assault. You most likley will survive if you get to the vent....if you get there first. If not will be stuck in the vent because you are being blocked/baited/its full or being viciously murdered from all ends by zombies cause sommone wont watch the dang back of the vent.


Updated review:  They deleted all my content. Spent a lot of money and hours on this game. They could have had a longer grace period or held info in cold storage till the user agreed to new terms. Disgraceful money grab game. I uninstalled it."
8608,this game is counter strike for free so everyone should play it's a great way to try or get into cs/counter strike
8609,ok game needs to be alittle funner and also make it so free to play can have a chance to get some new characters  otherwise the game os alright  though i would recomend adding a campaighn mode and better gear and like i said make it so free plaeyrs  can actually buy or get characters and better equipment

8612,I think this game needs a story mode and more server but other wise its a good game and i love it :)

8627,"Don't let the negative reviews fool you,this is actually a somewhat good game.
Well,it's certainly not the best game ever,but it is pretty nice.CS Nexon:Zombies is like the poor child of L4D and CS.Though it is not a game that you will get addicted to,it can provide some enjoyable gameplay."

8631,"for all who still love cs 1.6.

8637,"So they're just updating this game for new brand of weapons (purchase online only), no new map, no new zombie. Just lousy weapon & ticket...Uh, a ticket, so technically play a thousand hours then somehow you possibly get a ticket or not. I killed more than thousand zombies for a fun, except this is really lay off... 

Rather have no vitually purchased weapon instead.

Edited: So after the latast updated, devs decided that player should level up to 4-6 lvls get into 3 different modes... I could still give less than -2/10."

8643,"After a long time, I instaled this game again, and I found the new weapons are broken af.

There are dual pistols that have the firepower of a rifle, have infinite ammo, and can pierce through wood and walls. 

A sniper that is basically an insanely fast grenade launcher you don't even need to aim to kill someone.

A sword that can insta-kill you in one second and has an insane wide range. 

The upgraded guillotine now will headshot in one hit regardless of how strong is your zombie.

At this point I don't know why nexon hasn't sold a hacker pack with auto-aim and inmunity."
8644,"Kind of old, but very fun, It is a little bit too pay to win, but is a very fun and different Counter Strike game from Valve."
8645,"This game is horrible.

Looks very rushed (not visual wise)--because I know this game isn't about visuals, but coding-wise.
It's glicthy and buggy. 
It's not polished, it seems like they've quickly created this game to gain money from their micro-transactions, and to take advantage of the changing market: love for killing zombies. 

Now, for instance:
If you're the zombie, and you're getting shot at, you can't move. At all. Let alone being teamed on 2+ people, and you're pratically a frozen icicle. 
Jumping onto objects, you get weird glicthes, that I don't know how to explain.

If it's a FPS game I expect to aim down my sights to improve my aim; you can't do that.

When you turn one way and want to go to the other way, so you turn a full 180, not letting go of your keys, you slide a couple of feet back before you go in the direction you want.

I can't do a complete full-screen on my 22"" monitor; it won't let me. There's two giant black-borders around my screen  when I launch the game. 

This game, for a FPS and Free to Play in mind is the WORST First Person Shooter title I played."
8646,Nice Game ^_^
8647,This game is good but a little bit hard
8648,Zombie and CS Love it
8649,Fun game. Great practice for CS:GO.

8653,Feels like a loaded CS 1.6.
8654,"Its CS 1.6 for free.

It comes packaged with a few community mods and maps,and you cant add your own.It also features pay to win,but its possible to make lobbies where said p2w features are disabled.

The multiplayer is not dead,not even in obscure game modes like football."
8655,"Awesome game,made me kill my whole family 10/10"
8656,"BlackCipher2 Has ""detected me countless times"" not sure what for, possibly my name? GETM3RK3D?

This is my first time playing CS...Looks like fun but i honestly couldnt tell ya i could barley make it to the 5 minute mark to rate this game"

8659,good
8660,LOL this game is wack as hell. I never thought that i would get banned for posting threads in the forum. The people from nexon is just unreasonable. They didnt even provide me a reason why they banned me and yet I didnt use hack or anything like that to play the game. This game is not something that should even be developed as it suck so bad. I would not recommend this game to anyone and this game should be shut down as is. Developers shouldn't let their customer or players be so unsatisfied with such horrible game. Damn.

8673,Its not fun
8674,"Great game for those who dont have the funds to buy CS:GO but theres that one problem inTDM
You join a game late.
Your put on the terrible team
They continously kill you.
You rage

8677,"Why would you play this? Imagine pouring drain cleaner into a cup of bleach and then chugging it while playing THE SECOND MOST GOD AWFUL GAME I'VE ENCOUNTERED IN SOME TIME.   

The Graphics are shit (but that's expected it is based on the older game) The sounds are LAUGHABLY BAD. The ""community"" is barely anything more than five year olds who stole their parents credit card. And the company doesn't give a rats ass about the game. THERE IS NO REDEEMING VALUE IN THIS GAME, Actually wait yes there is. If you HATE yourself and you're emo, Play this game. It'll give you another reason to uncork that bottle of bleach and chug it. Just for the LOVE OF GABEN DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. OH DID I MENTION THAT THERE'S ALSO SPYWARE BUILT INTO THE INSTALLER? GOTTA LOVE THAT

edit: this game still sucks, p2w and full of noobs. I only go on this game to rekt them.

EDIT2: this game is trash, keeps banning me for 14days cuz I rekt noobs and also destroy the forum GMs and they get mad. i.e NXFANGORZ that guy is trash at the game

edit3: this game scams players to log on because they will reward an item, but doesn't give that said item. False advertisement and no one reports the bug because this is a dead game with less than 400 players each day LMAO

edit4: trash dead game with forum moderators that warn you if you say their game is dead LOL
being a forum moderator is their only accomplishment in life that's why they need the game to not die in order to maintain their status as CSNS forum moderator that works for free!

8695,"Had a lot of potential to be a fun mod, but in its current state humans are too op

bullet knockback is the same as normal CS and not reduced at all

Since humans have guns and zombies can only melee its like a team of knifers trying to beat a team of normal csgo players

the devs tried to fix this by giving some zombies more health or grenades but it just lets them get knockback longer

all humans have to do to win is sit in a corner and spam when zombies try to get up

also server browser is confusing"

8713,full of cheaters
8714,"a good game
I had one problem though
to actually play the game it takes 30 mins because it takes a few tries connecting to servers because the connection sometimes times out"
8715,"the game would be acceptable if it didn't crash each 15 minutes. the multiple issues are: ften crash when joining a friend via steam, crash when entering the game (this was more often experienced by my firend, i personally didn't exeperienced it.) and finally crash while the game is on (same here, my friend who was testing with me had this issue multiple times).
with a bit more stability updates it could be an awesome clone of counter-strike global offensive.
but for the moment i don't recommend it, unless you want to help with the bugs."
8716,"This is really fun even though its old
"
8717,"it is my fav
"
8718,"This game is a masterpiece, a perfect mix of emotions, drama and intense action.

It made me feel sad, it made me cry, it made me smile, and most importantly, I lost my mind.

This game is like a worn out dying child, but you can't build up the courage to put it out of it's misery.

When you first start the game after a lengthy loading screen, you get a barebones character creator.
After you've created your monstrosity you get plopped into the world, with no context, nothing. Then you're free to explore! Explore the 15¬≤ block of nothing.

After laughing intensely at it's awfulness, you're ready to go meet other people. The first 2 people I met was ""Springs"" and ""‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•er"".

You haven't seen ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• until you've played Genesis Online, if you even call this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, it's fecal matter that's exploded out of a hippos ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• while it was muckspreading. Playing this game is like wiping your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• with your toothbrush, then using it to brush your teeth for the rest of your life. Oh, and the micro-transactions? Awful, it would be more fun to throw your money off a bridge or give it to someone in need, than to spend $30 for a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing house.

My final rating for this ""game"", is a ""Ride To Hell: Retribution"" out of 10."
8719," if you are kind of person who loves p2w, this game can destroy your wallet faster than steam sales."
8720,"This game is a big letdown in the CS series. It crashes, its laggy (depending on what system you have), and when i played it for the ffirst and last time, i had no idea what to do. in general, stay away from the game."
8721,just cant connect to a single game
8722,"Unlike CS:GO, I enjoy this game. My only complaint; When you are shot, you can't move. You're characters movement just kinda stutters. Yes, I know, it's the same in Global Offensive. I'm not sure who thought that was a good idea.
Overall, multiplayer IS fun and so is zombies."
8723,"biggest fucking joke and shame to the CS community.
Its like no one has morals anymore.

8725,this game sucks
8726,awesome absoluetly love dis gaem

8734,"I have played CSOLÔºåis as same as this game.I guess Csol is more fun but this game you could spend less money....
Pay to winÔºåthat's ture.But when you play with your friends or you have a good skill and you are lucky,everything is changed.

For a lot of you guys, cs NEXON-ZOMBIES is not a real cs game.But just because its gamemode,it's became unique.This game really need you to spend lots of your money if you dont play it for a long time.But if you enjoy it,time is not a problem.

By the way, mostly teamates are SUCK(There are no coop)! Everyone just care about themselves when I try to lead the team. For team work,CSGO is much better."
8735,preety cool for counter strike!!
8736,Very nice very nice very nice

8744,this game is for those of you who want to play csgo type games but dont what tospend any money and plays really well even on my 7year old pc at about 60fps
8745,"The Graphics might be dated but its SO FUNNNNNNN.....................

ONLY IF YOU LIKE A GAME THAT IS GARBAGE

+++++Its free to play


xD This review makes no sense"
8746,ok im recommend this game for the people who dont care about the graphics... dont think cause the new vid trailer has ok graphics and stuff... this game has like an early 2000's kinda game graphics... but it still lets you play classic counter-strike for free with new guns and TONS of modes... It has 3 catagorys for them (typo sorry) 1. Counter-strike 2. Zombies 3. FUN I have never played the Fun game modes there is not alot of them last time I checked around 3 but the counter-strike modes are good (I like CS:GO's CS modes better than these classic ones) and it has like 30 zombie modes and there ALL FUN! and like 10 CS modes and 3 Fun ones... I think its a good game... just has really REALLY outdated graphics for a 2014 game... but I like it!
8747,it sucks
8748,Worst Counter Strike ever. Period.
8749,"Pros
-Counter strike elements
-Zombies 
-Original, deathmatch and team deathmatch 
Cons
-Pay 4 skins 
-Zombie scenario mode is just shoot everything you see
"
8750,"I played CS 1.6 , I have CS:GO.So I thought,""Let's try this.""It is good.Only thing is that instead of skins,it is weapons with skins,sprray paint stuff,Mileage Deacoder,People,etc to buy.Other than that,good game!"
8751,"This game was perfectly made , it is perfect , awsome , I love the way you made your weapons , and how you constructed them , your grahpics are perfect , and I just wanna say , this game is the best zombie game (in my decision) :)"
8752,"good practice for other fps games, it's like bots; ez"
8753,"Wow, the worst game ever! way worse than Counter strike 1.6 and also when i shoot A AWP at a terrorist it takes 10 shots while a guy that dosn't even headshot me with a USP pistol kills me in 1 shot and aswell i had 100 health. unfair. P2W."
8754,Is a good game!!!

8761,low game
8762,"This is a pretty cool game,great for them old school type of gamers"
8763,"Hmmmm...Let's see...

Gamemodes and maps:
They are OK but could be better. Almost every game I played was on de_dust2

Characters:
Half of the players are using the female characters which is Ok with me, but it distracts players around them. Oh, and you have to buy them for $6.99 each.

Weapons:
Too OP and don't fit in with the rest of the theme. Oh, how many times have I been unfairly killed by these weapons. Example: I join a game. I am last standing player on my team. I see an enemy. I have an AK-47, enemy has this weird gun. It looks like a Nerf blaster. All my bullets miss, he shoots a laser. Instantly dead.

DLC:
Yes, there is DLC for this game. I know, shocking! And they cost around 15.00 - 20.00$ And throw some microtransactions in there aswell, why not?

Pros:
- Money Wasting Simulator 2420
- Exit button si the best button in the entire game!
- Random noobs inviting me to some stupid parties
- Best OP weapons 2069

Cons:
- Careless money grab
- Laggy and boring gameplay
- Don't play unless you're too poor to buy CS 1.6
- Almost every Basic is on de_dust2
- Makes me wanna cry :,C
- In every game there is a single guy just standing in spawn not doing anything
- You HAVE to come every day for rewards or you will only have bad, underpowered weapons
-  Every single ""custom"" weapon is a gimmick
- Waste of space
- This game exists. volvo pls fix

BEST UNINSTALL/EXIT SIMULATOR 1337/420 IGNE"
8764,Great game but sucks when banned for once being on forums with leaks for addons etc. and forums about coding lua and other things for darkrp server and gmod???? And yea on my browser at the time i was on all that but it is all legal or v3rmillion that isnt bad but yet i decided not to close browser's and start csnz to play and didnt see any notice of this new bad sites ban system but yet didnt close down browser being afraid of losing progress with server and i got banned 869 hours almost everygun & not to mention 600 + dollars spent on this game total bs
8765,"This is a great game, not the greatest graphics but over all a game to try."
8766,love playing this
8767,Just a copy of counterstrike 1.6 :\
8768,"Fucking eula is in my way how do i agree to it?
"
8769,"its shit
"
8770,cant even play this... IT SUX
8771,"I'll say this once and only once: avoid what most of the negative reviews say

Of course this game has its ups and downs but it's still really worth it to play and here are some reasons why:
1. Don't have CS and want to play it? Get this it's free!
2. Zombie fans will love this because theres a PVE mode where your to do a set task while surviving zombies ( Even though sometimes the spawn points can be really cheap )
3. Like to do a build and survive type of game? There's a mode in here for that and it's really good ( I mainly played it >.> )
4. If you want to waste about 30 minutes to an hour then this is a game you can do that because it's so intense in the PvE that you want to stay and play, it's just fun in general to be honest

If you want to get this I really do suggest it as it can be a really good game if you have fun and look past the minor details that it has that may be bad"
8772,"If you play or played CS:GO Or CS:S non-addon zombie mod THEN DON'T PLAY THIS GAME.
If you played or play CS:O , CS 1.6 Zombie mod (Addon of course) or CS Xtreme Version, then I fully recommend you this game."
8773,This game SUCKS.. but still better than COD
8774,This is amazing best survival i've ever EVER played!!!
8775,It`s a lot like the original Counter Strikes.  Which is a good thing you can play competitive or play againsts zombies.
8776,"this game is cool
"
8777,Dont know if its just my laptop or not but the game would start up and crash and was really glitchy so ive given up on it  but if it wasnt for that the  game play itself would have been okay.
8778,Alright  Looks like old cs
8779,Cool zombie game!
8780,this game is fine
8781,"Meh, Counter Strike: Globial Offesive was better same with Counter-Strike:Source. But if you just want to mess around with your friends then it's fun to do if you don't have any money to use as Steam cash so yes I would suggest this game but don't judge it or Counter-Strike:Source on how they look judge them on how much fun you had with your friends etc. fooling, and messing around with your buddies on Steam
        In conclusion, yes I do reccomend this game, Counter-Strike Nexon:Zombies.
"
8782,"This is the worst game i had ever played, this game is just a Crash Simulator, i mean seriously i tried to join a friend`s game and the game crashed, then i tried to join a game by myself and what happend? i was loading and this piece of shit crashed, i wasted like 20 minutes trying to play this game

Best Crash Simulator EVER!!!"

8801,"Although on the surface Counter - Strike Nexon: Zombies seems like another Korean/Asian Free to Play Shooter, with its many microtransactions, and misc. items that improve the appearance of your character. This game was a hidden gem in a pile of shit. The core gameplay of its ""origional"" modes play similar to that of the beloved game Counter - Strike 1.6. Although this is a great feature of the game, what really struck me as this game being a hidden game in the once great free to play world, was the actual promoted zombie survival/senario mode. Its thriller nonsense and endless waves of zombies kept me and my friend captivated and motivated with the game mode. While being a great game mode it still has a lot of point deductions on my behalf. Just as an example of these said point deductions from the game, it seems like the ""EASY"" game mode isn't really easy. I quote, ""It feels like playing round 95 in black ops zombies..."", but nevertheless this hardness of the gamemode actually enticed me to play the game more with my friend. It is a wonderful gaming experience if you have a couple of friends to play with. Also, its great if you got VAC banned in CSGO, im not pointing any fingers....

I rate this this game a solid 8.9/10 Coconuts.

It would seem i dont have enough hours on it but, i played this so much on my alt account... Don't worry my friends, this is a truthful reivew."

8810,"i enjoy this game alot,."
8811,REALLY GOOD WOULD PLAY AGAIN ILLUMANATI CONFIRMED JOHN CENA (input a really really loud segment here)
8812,this game is so cool if you play cs:go and cs 1.6 you will need to play it a lot to handle the game or you will get bored of it and if you were lucky you'll get good guns from crafting and decoders so feel  good about it and take it
8813,very fine game for a free game skins are awesome.
8814,It says i need steam i already have steam if that happens DELETE theres no fixing it sorry to be a game bum :(
8815,this was fun in 2016
8816,I really want to love this game. I also really wanna have it not crash on me.

It's too difficult to understand how it works.
I play it just for the 1.6.

8830,OK GUYS This game is awsome! I am a FPS Tester and i have been using a 4GB of Ram PC it is an HP Laptop and i haven't been Finding cheap games that this PC Can handle. When i saw this game i was like WOW this game is awsome! Its just like COD and im a huge fan if the CounterStrike Series! This is one of the many games im gunna record on my channel and if your looking to play a good free and non laggy FPS then i recomend this game! i have only played it for like 7 hours But when i logged into that game I knew this game was going to be sick! So if your looking for a good FPS this is the way to go! This is my Full Review on this game. Also whoever made this game KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!

8841,it is horrible
8842,"[b]CS:NZ dumb review:[/b]

WAIT! Is this fucking Blockstorm? since when? This game is already bad and add some dumb stuff from voxel FPS games?
This is a new level of stupidty! this game is a shame to the CS franchise. studio mode is good way to build maps but in the voxel style like Guncraft, Blockstorm and these types of games., is bad, it's good to build maps with in game models and stuff like this. I don't think it is worth to waste your time in this horrible game. 

Pros and Cons.

Pros:
-Same good and old CS gameplay but with new gamemodes and stuff.
-CS 1.6 with new weapons.
  Cons:
-Shitty anime characters and weapons.
-They deleted CS:O for this.
-Zombie mode got me like: ""why is this a thing?"".
-How valve accepted this? 
-Voxel map building? why? you have many fucking voxel FPS games which are better than this ass game.

Bad game, should be removed in 2018 and why are they still developing this game?

Score: 2.0/10
Just don't even look at this cover even the cover made me puke."
8843,It's an interesting game for Counter Strike fans
8844,Fun for once but it's still a shit game

8854,Spent over 150 hours and they have reseted my account.. GJ NEXON! SPENT 150 HOURS AND OVER 10 EUROS FOR WHAT? FOR RESETING MY ACCOUNT?
8855,"If you want to play Counter-Strike for free, get this. Graphics are lacking, but gameplay is good."
8856,Best one so far.
8857,Thanks Korea for making such a fun shitty game. My friend and I have a blast playing this even though it's bad. Like REALLY bad. I rate 5/10. Fun... but horrible.
8858,Download it  and you get my friend request :)
8859,Sucks!

8862,"roses are red

zombies are cool

8863,Good
8864,2 anime 4 me
8865,"This is pretty much a mush-up of CS 1.6 and CS:CZ merged together with CS:GO-Market then added on-top of the unholy mixture. It perverts the damn scene by using Counter-Strike in its name when it is NOT a true CS game and never will be.

Avoid at all damn costs. F2P is great if there weren't so many better choices with the one time pay for CS 1.6, CS:S and CS:GO. Nexon is running on ancient gear, the game feels like its more of a money machine than an actual competitive, cooperative, fun game and if you really need Zombies, there are still great servers in CS:S, CS:GO continues to grow some more and honestly, if it wasn't for the CS part, this game would be another DayZ flop.

The Mixed Reviews are very warranted, keep reading your queue. I tried it and ran after seeing the shitty DRM Launcher they force you to use. Also, notice the lack of VAC? I could hack the launcher and give myself the ol spinbotting. And I hate cheating. That's how piss-poor this game is.

Newbies: Do not let this game be your introduction to Counter-Strike. Download CS:GO instead. http://blog.counter-strike.net/ Yes, CS:GO has Micro-transactions and a market like Nexon but you get no stat bonuses, its all purely cosmetic and the true point of it is to make yourself more individual than generic. You can pick what you want and if you no longer want it, you can sell it. Compared to the $24.99 dragon set in the listed DLC, you can sell $24 worth of shit in CS:GO and get over half of it back if you're careful.

Good luck!"
8866,Just Dont. I played for 20 mins. then quit because i was having a god awful time. The Only part I liked was when the bar was moving across to uninstall.
8867,"Only button that worked was the ""abort"" button when the game crashed instantly.  GG, uninstall works also 9/11 ign"
8868,This is barley playable. 3/10
8869,the game is buggy everytime they update something other than that great game
8870,Great game afraid at first this game will suck nut it doesnt you get daliy prizes and other cool stuff
8871,Very fun game
8872,This game is classic counter strike but it's free and has lots of cool new guns and gamemodes. Ignore all the trolls and haters. This game is fun and is not very pay to win. You can take part in events and still get good guns for free without even spending a single penny on this game.
8873,"Really cool game! But it was cool if you can play like Counter-Strike : Newgame,Servers...

"
8874,P2W
8875,This game is best 11/10 !
8876,bad
8877,"It's a better version of Counter Strike 1.6 and i like that bcz of new weapons and modes . Sadly it's pay 2 win , but u can catch up some events to get cool stuff even some stuff that u can buy with money ."
8878,"Do you want an unrefined trash cash grab that is based on who has the largest wallet? Then here you go! You've found it!

This very poorly designed mod of the source engine is the classic example of people stealing something that is amazing and turning it into a sad attempt to grab cash and make this game an unplayable joke. 

The loading is slow, fails half the time and throws a bunch of useless junk into your face that as a new player you have no idea what to take of it. You get daily encentives to log on every day, but the items you get are lousy and just be bought with several real dollars, so who cares? Why wait 7 days to get a random skin or gun you can just spend 2 dollars to get. 

The regular mode is just an slightly altered version of the original counter strike, with the bots mod the only viable versus mode due to the rampant pay to win culture. The zombies defense can be fun if played with friends, but gets very busy and difficult hard, and to top this is the rediculous hit box zombies have, making it nearly impossible to even play anytihng but turret spam defense. The guns are garbage, late game the zones to buy ammo are nearly impossible to access due to poor zombie coding and the overall fact that this game is just ugly in colour.

It didn't take me very long to kick this game out of my libary, after just 10 minutes of looking at the main menu and jumping into a zombie game, me and my two friends instantly laughed at how bad this game is.

Don't try it, and expect only headaches from this pathetic money grab.

Personal Rating: 1/5"
8879,Counter Strike 1.6 with zombies and sh*t!? yes pls
8880,well it could be a bit better
8881,"It's a really cool game, and I think the graphics are good, the only thing that I hate is how after I reload, it takes like 3 seconds to actually fully reload if you understand me, still good though."
8882,AweSome Online Game.....Im Loving it.
8883,"worst form of pay to win ive seen in a long while, basically decoders unlock the good weapons, but it takes forever to get them, and when you do get them you have to play ""bingo"" which means most of the time your rolling numbers that arn't on the bingo board aka decoders down the drain.......

The other option is crafting, but from what i can tell it takes even longer to get the items to do that.  When you start the game for the first time you get a bunch of stuff to start off doing it, enough to make 3 or 4 guns but soon as your out it seems really hard to get anymore.  The first day i had all of the daily missions unlocked, but i didn't realize you had to go claim each one that should have been way more clear....so i lost all of that, but now it seems really hard to unlock the missions like today i only managed to get 3 unlocked.

Worst of all the game is super buggy, hackers everywhere, sometimes u get frozen in place and can't move.  But its worst pay to win because as a human it takes forever.............to kill a zombie, then when u turn zombie you can't kill any of the humans that are in the vents because they all have high end gear and headshot you,  All the zombie skills feel like they do nothing at all which is lame.  Ontop of that the human guns have 'knockback' against zombies and the game is so buggy that you are 99% of the time getting knocked back, even when they are reloading...................it all just seems way to much in favor of those with the good guns."

8896,This game is so bad dear god I would rather have sex with a used tampon...
8897,"If you enjoy killing Zombies, this game gives you that but not much more, you do have Original mode, which is what I played most.

So if you want more in depth reviews about the Zombie side of the game you should scroll down to see reviews of people who played zombie mode more than I did.

I'm just gonna focus on the Original.

So, you will mostly just play 1 map, Dust2. You will experience how many people are actually good with the ARX *cough cough*.

There is not much more to be said, except that if you do enjoy Counter Strike 1.6 with some extra spice then I recommend playing this, it's fun and I didn't encounter much cheaters. There is quite a large player base as I saw, but a lot of Turkish or so people, and A LOT of russians (as all CS games).

Don't let my hours fool you, I'm a veteran of Counter Strike games, I always enjoyed it, even the lows of this one are blown away by the love for this still to this day awesome game.

I would rate it a solid 8/10.

8946,"This game is a fun game to play when bored. It has everything from 1.6 back but with zombies. Bhopping is just as great as before too. There are a lot of gamemodes to choose from. Zombie hero- Humans vs Zombies, both teams being playable. Zombie Scenario's- Fight a zombie boss with a ton of you're friends. There are also a lot of other gamemodes to play. Then there is the games little level up system. You get exp from killing zombies,doing missions,killing zombie bosses,infecting humans on the zombie hero gamemode,and lots of other ways. There is a inventory like thingy where you can customize you're character. You can get other weapons also that are better than the ones you have. Theres a lot more shit to cover but i need to 420 dank no scope some zombies on Nexon. This game is just a flashback to 1.6 but still a ton of fun."

In this game though (CS:NZ) if you want new content you have to pay. So no, your "" You don't have to buy the DLC/Microtransactions, it's optional"" arguement is not valid. I never paid for any CS 1.6 mod, that's why me and a lot of others got thousands of hours on it.

Edit : Someone told me that I only played 0.2 hours so the review isn't accurate. Well, as soon as I launched the game I was drowned in microtransactions and advertisements. Taking a quick look at what those items do I realized that they aren't only cosmetics so there you go, hope you find this one useful."

8989,"ok its not for the zombies mode of course , is just for the cs feeling that cs go changed it negativly is just like the old good times of cs 1.6 it has some minor bugs but its ok . about the zombies part now it is fun to paly with friends but again its not for the zombies and also the way i call the soccer mode is : fps fifa 2015 cs edition (oh if you have a problem opening the game right click the shortcut and then run as an adminstinator it will fix the problem , you may also have to repaet it if doesnt work and then reboot your system 
now are coming the statics

Pros
lots of fun with friends
good gfx for its engine (but for current engines ...... 4/10)
i managed to play it on my grandmoms pentinum 4 computer without lag
always you will have a special time in every round you play
frienly community

Cons
Minor bugs
As i mentioned earlier 4/10 gfx

Anyway i recommend this game to everyone who wants some free , pure , lagless fps and counter strike feeling"

It is very similar in its functionality to the ones used by Valve (VAC) or Blizzard (Warden) to protect their community from cheaters.

Client-side anti-cheat tools are considered to be much safer than server-side ones and they all have to scan information on your PC to protect the game from cheaters.
These programs are hashing scanned strings and comparing them to those of known malicious programs. No actual information about your system is ever sent or saved.

Please note that anti-cheat tools are a necessity in multiplayer games to protect you, our community, and please be assured that your privacy is important to us too. 

Regards,
[NX]Dualism

- According to this Nexon Developer Dualism, "" No actual information about your system is ever sent or saved."" So what is the point of having Xigncode3 on our computers that are "" hashing scanned strings and comparing them to those of known malicious programs""? All information online is being sent, received, saved, and transcribed. If you have the balls to claim that ""No actual information about your system is ever sent or saved"" then you shouldn't be a developer at all because you have ZERO  knowledge of how data works online.   

If Xigncod3 does not send or store information, how is it that another Nexon Developer is able to tell a user (on the forums) [**it is or will be deleted by Nexon when you read this review**]  that they were visting a malicious website regarding hacks, cheats, etc (I don't know what the user was on). Information was sent somewhere so that the developer could read the log or history and determine the user was on a malicious website. In order to have a log or history... something was saved. Ex. How do we know what happened in the past if it wasn't written down? That was your first contradiction Dualism. 

Xigncode does not store information about my system huh? How do you explain that the program keeps track of everything on the users computer and what was modify within the last 48 hours? Is it necessary for Nexon or the company that codes Xigncode to know what print driver I have installed or that I created a meme on Microsoft Paint? I mean that meme is a new/edited file. Do you really want to see it that bad before i post it on Imgur or 9gag?  Second contradiction Dualism. 

Also, just because the information being sent by Xigncode may be (BIG MAY BE)  encrypted doesn't mean a hacker  (reverse engineer) can't decode the encryption and possibly steal user connection info such as ip address, internet company they use and possibly more. Big companies like Walmart, JPMorgan Chase and Target got hacked for their customer credit cards. Here is a full list of companies that were hacked in 2014
http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/10/cyber-attacks-on-us-companies-in-2014 

How is one to trust a gaming company so small that it can compare itself to Valve and Blizzard which have superior net worth and income levels to protect users if their data was ever breached?Thats your third contradiction Dualism. Xigncode may perform similar functions as Valve (Vac) and Blizzard (Warden) but it doesn't guarantee user protection.  Also if Counter-strike Nexon Zombies is on Steampowered which is owned by Valve why not adopt the VAC system? Nexon Zombies is basically a big mod of Counter-Strike 1.6 so shouldn't it adopt the same anti-cheat system?

The fact that Nexon changes their EULA on the whim without letting their users know is questionable. Blizzard, Valve, Ubisoft all send out notices that EULA has been updated/changed and asks the user to accept it. Most don't read it but we at least know it was updated/changed. 

Dualism, Do you care to update or change your response? 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Updated* (11/18/15) - Nexon is currently using XIGNCODE for their hack sensor. XIGNCODE scans all the files within your computer that was opened in the last 48 hours as well as the websites you've visited within those hours.. This is a huge breach of your rights, and privacy and a potential data .mine for hackers..



Game use to be good.... Now it just sucks. Most servers are filled with lag and people teleporting thru the map. Every update/patch seems to make the servers worse. Game has been more about money grabbing by Nexon then building a gaming community that appreciates the game thus more likely to actually spend. Majority of the players are EU>SA>NA but SA players are unsupported with a server. They piggyback on NA servers causing all types of lag and server glitches due to their connection. If you're in NA servers expect your ping to bounce from <100 to about 200-300+. Not many hackers which is a +1 but a ton of people abuse bugs and tons who use VPN even tho is banned by Nexon. +1 for staff since they actually read forum posts."

9029,Free counter strike.
9030,"Well..what can I say about this game - It's not as good as the original CS 1.6 or Condition Zero, but it's worth to play it,especially,because it's free. Although there sometimes are a lot of errors with the game server and you need to re-launch the game 5 freaking times, it's still not that bad. I do like to play it sometimes,it's really fun with friends, just running around,killing every enemy you see or just screwing around. It still cannot beat the original Counter Strikes simplicity and enjoyability but it's worth it to try it out."
9031,This would be a nice free-to-play old CS 1.6 with zombies mods with fantastic guns & fun characters. Please therefore do not use the standards of recents FPS games' graphics to score it.

9035,Love it most played game on my steamvgame list. With old graphics and somewhat different controls it got good gameplay and a full multiplayer. Its really just free cs 1.6 and zombies. But loadouts and settings menu r scary as hell. Id give this 8.7 outta 10

9070,"While many of the reviews have spoken poorly regarding this game, I would have to assume they are from children or stubborn trolls who are closed minded. The anti cheat, server system and game modes all work very well making this a great alternative to cs 1.6 and also a great way to get newbies into the cs community.  The zombie modes are very entertaining and the regular servers are consistantly updated. Great free to play game!!!  10/10"
9071,Good game but could use some tweeks.
9072,Very crappy graphics but its also glichy andun balenced at times...
9073,"      This is a great copy of Counter-Strike: Source, or Counter Strike, as it has most of the same characters in a totally different game, made by a totally different company. The spray model is OK, but you have to tap your mouse in order to get a decent or accurate kill with almost every gun. They have different lobbies, which I think is incredible, first of all because there is never a lobby with cheaters in it, yet you can still create you OWN lobby with a variety of different modes in multiplayer you can do. Although the game is mostly Pay to Win, or Pay to Play, you can still Play for Free without buying anything, and reaching the max level without pay.
     This is pretty much my version of the game in a nut-shell. TL;DR Great game, 8/10 would install again."

As for the gameplay, it is ok for a F2P game."

9100,"Not being mean or anything but this would work for me and i sat there for 2 hours trying to make it work?????
"
9101,"Good CHRIST, this game is shit.

You probably want a bit more of a review than that, don't you? Where to start...

Gameplay:
The gameplay is as unbalanced as possibly could be. If the humans manage to hold back the zombies long enough (you won't be getting rid of them by the way, they have shitloads of health and they respawn unless the killing blow is a headshot, which is practically impossible to get because the zombies move around all the time) and manage not to get 2 to 3 people killed and turned into zombies before they get to the camping spots they're basically unstoppable.
If the zombies do manage to kill a few humans at the start of the round with their bullshit instant kill melee-attacks however, those people also get turned into zombies, which means the humans are royally screwed.

Technical issues:
The game is broken as hell. It will often crash on startup, and when it does, it fails to tell Steam that you're not in the game anymore. Yes, your status will say ""PLaying Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies"" long after you shut the game down (or it crashes), making you look like an obsessive. Starting another game doesn't help, you have to reboot your computer to fix this. So that's fun.

Level design:
Absolutely no effort went into this. They just took your standard olde school Counterstrike maps, made it dark and fogged them up a notch. The low visibillity is one of the most annoying things in the game, because even if you do manage to navigate though a cluttered room in the dark, it will not be without a zombie having viciously torn you a new one.

Free to play elements:
Oh yes, this game has microtransactions. That's right, folks! If you pay money for this you'll get an alternate player model to show people how dumb and bad with money you are!

It may be free, but it's not worth your time. Go buy a propper zombie game if you want one that bad."
9102,This Is A Free Version And Little Trial Of CS If You Like This Youll Probably Like Other CS Games
9103,"Detected by blackchipper 2 *game closes* Wtf?

i am expecting this to be an anticheat system, but i didn't do anything cheaty ;-;

Devs you have 2 options:
1 Fucking fix this shit anticheat (or whatever)
2You get doomed >:["
9104,chinese shit
9105,"The trailer is nothing like the game.
"
9106,"WHAT ARE THOSE?!?
It's a really shitty game from a really shitty company staining the reputation of a good game

-0.69 / 42 Would uninstall again - IGN"
9107,game is honestly super fun. these kids here who only care about graphics play 2 mins see the in game lobby and leave are sad. ITs a free 2 play game with a shit ton of modes. Modes that are so unique its realy hard to get bored. LIke shelter mode is insane fun with friends build your base up and fight off zombies at night. 10/10 would leave my friends behind again.
9108,The game isnt THAT bad but don't waste your time download this game its not worth it. Even though the game is free this is a waste of your time. I played this game one day and got bored.
9109,"I'm afraid that i will have to change my review about this game. It's just falling flat and dying day by day, a cash grab game with no heart or thinking put into it. They destroyed literally every mode there is with their updates. I'm sad to say CSO not CSNZ will no longer be the same as before. Don't waste your money and time on this game, it's a lost cause. 

The management, admins on the forum and the community are one of the most toxic / ignorant people i've seen. They don't want what's best for you, they just only care about themselves. Good bye Zombie Scenario mode! You were the best mode in that game! The classic maps are completely brushed off with the P2W weapons. Sometimes a person doesn't have to increase the difficulty to 9 when he doesn't have OP weapons and can die in 1 hit, but still doesn't want to fight a boss that can die in 10 seconds when other players have OP weapons (I'll call them OP and not P2W guns because it can be easily managed by the DEVS but they are not doing anything so.

And also RIP zombie hide and seek mode. In my opinion that mode is very underrated and not appreciated enough, it could be one of the most fun gamemodes in there but no one plays it, not even 1 room.

And stop with the free giveaways and 120 minutes farm in-game events! They are just bad and a cheap way to make people stay in this game. Cut this shit out nexon."

9115,This game is just a shitty ripoff of the original. Not impressed. 0/10
9116,why is this not for IOS users?
9117,"While i enjoyed playing in sg/my server back in 2012,2013 and playing on this server for more than 2 years since its release i still kinda wish that i didn't find this cs ''clone'' at all while browsing the net one day. Since the Beta,Launch of csn:z now known as csn:s until early of 2017 the game was in a fine state imo. There were some op weapons but nothing extreme really like it was kinda balanced i guess? Then later on it started to slowly go down hill from there with them adding ridiculous op weapons and thanks to that i lost interest in playing this game. I understand that the company has to make money somehow but at least balance the new weapons that come out by making them slightly more powerful than the previous released weapons and not heavily more powerful. I've tried to come back to this game multiple times as a casual player to see what has changed what's new etc but after playing a certain amount of time it just gets stale and not fun at all. Still i`ll give them credit for doing events often and giving out weapons on trial and for certain amount of days for newer players so that they don't get shit on by veteran players that have loaded inventories.

Overall i don't really recommend playing this game because its grind heavy and also p2w obviously that is unless u just want to chill and play it for fun sometimes then sure be my guest."
9118,shit game
9119,Great game!!! :)
9120,"Boring, unbalanced game. Cs 1.6 have better zombie modes on public servers"
9121,"This game is a piece of trash and it has a VAC Wannabe protection, they ban you permanent for no reason."
9122,"Of all the Counter Strike Games, this is the one to play. It is basically CS 1.6 with added features and game modes that improve the game overall.
PROS:
Free
Built-in video capture
Not very competitive for what it is.
Tons of added gamemodes, weapons, features most of which are awesome.
Zombies
Very low minimum requirements.

CONS:
The guns are Extremely innacurate
The armor is actually silly putty
You will stop moving if you are hit
The store makes it a bit of a P2W

Admiteddly those don't seem very bad and they are fairly easy to fix, but when you are playing they get VERY annoying very fast."
9123,"funny game 
but not that good game"
9124,"Hello, this is my review of Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies.

I liked zombie mode on counter strike 1.6, and zombie escape too. But i fell in love when i got to play it on CS Source i said, holy shit this is AWESOME , half of my hours on CS source are on zombie escape. So one day  i though, this is so good, why do not anybody makes a game about this?. Oh boy. When i saw counter strike nexon zombies i said, hmmmm counter strike and zombies gj valve, i though at the moment. 

So i opened the game and the problems started even before i joined a match, i clicked play and i waited like 10 minutes because an anti-cheat stuff was analyzing me, i was like OK, im sure i wont find bad people or hackers on this game at least. 

The menu is kind of league of legends style, so i did not say anything. My first match was Zombie hero , which a zombie is picked randomly and he needs to infect everybody on the map, and humans need to make a camp spot so they can survive. Nothing wrong, right?.  ALL WRONG, i was playing on italy the only good camp spots were in buildings, i was like ""no zombie will get us"" but i saw people like falling back and i was like ""are you scared or what?"" , then i was flying in the sky and fell into the zombies, Why?. EVERY ZOMBIE CLASS has at least 2 GRANADES, Why a zombie would have a granade lol?. 
So i played like 30 min of that, and then i went to the mode i was waiting for, oh glorious zombie escape. I dont remember the map i played, but i noticed that with a knife you dont run any faster, which is a really big  disadvantage! I was like ok, lets get through this. 
HORRIBLE, at least on CS source you had times when you needed to shoot all the zombies that were coming, in that map everybody was running escaping and thats it lol , like a marathon. The map was short really short, and people threw flashbangs in the most important parts so we would mess up. And there was a part in which you needed to be like the first one running because you needed to press a button to make an elevator WOrk and people had 3 seconds to get in . Wow.... I got rekt in that part too many times, even one time i got killed by the elevator... JUst beated it once. I played like 13 rounds.

In conclussion:

Nexon, you should not be proud of ANYTHING. The modders that do not get the money that you are getting right now are more dedicated, they do better maps. And they even work with a BETTER ENGINE.  I just see people playing it because its free to play and i tell them, Counter strike source zombie escape is the best one , and they answer  me, is that a PC game too?.
I think that you should release a second installment with the source engine soon and fix that balance problems (seriously, who needs flashbangs and smoke granades on zombie escape, and zombies MUST NOT HAVE WEAPONS)
AND PLEASE, REMOVE THAT ANNOYING VOICE ""THE ZOMBIES WIL LBE BACK"" , I KNOW THEY WILL RE-SPAWN!!!!

Graphics: 5/10 (gld source engine on a new game?)
Gameplay: 3/10 (The mod is better than this)
Sound: 1/10 (Some weapons sound cool because that were their original sound in CS, but the new weapons sound awful, and that annoying voice, oh god , and the zombie radio chat is SOOOO ORIGINAL)
Performance: 5/10 (You may say, why 5/10, this game runs on a fucking potato, First, im not getting the frame rate i should, i get 70fps but i do not get more, and there are people out there on the servers playing at 30fps, the gld source engine is one of the best optimized engines, and CS 1.6 did not run like this!)
Overall: 4/10   

This game can still be fixed, if they want to balance it, but they do not care, people play it and they think they are playing something good....

P.D: Needed to close the game as administrator because the quit button and the close button did not worked...."
9125,Got a knife and didn't have to spend 400 euros.
9126,"when was this made? 1990s? if not, then this game is a failed attempt at a money grabber. waste of my 10 minutes..."

7/10"
9131,"I like this game, it's free and has A LOT of cool and fun guns to use. I only like this game because of the guns, I reccomend trying it out for a bit getting cooler and better guns and the best thing about this game is decoders because it's like the cases in CSGO except you don't need keys and the game gives you many opportunities for free decoders :)"
9132,Godd game !!
9133,"From what i've played of it, this is basically CS 1.6 with a bunch of different weapons and a zombies mode. there doesn't seem to be balance issues, about 70% of the additional weapons feel like a reskin or another. the zombies mode has a few bugs and gets a bit boring after a while, but i didn't install this for zombies. it allows me to play the old cs the way i remember it (almost). about the only problems are the menu, which is god awful, and the support for this game is more money driven than community driven. It'd be neat to see workshop support, though that would never happen."
9134,The most Shittiest Game ever >> i cant describe the Hate for this game !! I hate this more THAN CALL OF DUTY

9142,"My grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."

9145,it is good but not the best zombie game. i like cs zombie mode very much but this is not quite the same that i playd on cs 1.6. but i still reacomend the game.
9146,.
9147,"is nice but I expected more, 5/10, Im still prefering the 1.6 zombie resident version."
9148,Awsome game!!
9149,COOL AS HELL
9150,fun but u hav to figure it out
9151,"Too much flair, too much bullshit, and that subtle thing that reminds you it's a free-to-play game released in asia with the sole attempt of nothing but money.

This is the poor man's Counter-Strike. Hell, I'd probably say Tactical Intervention is the better game, and that's not saying much. CS Nexon: Zombies is a super messy version of 1.6 with clunky UI, annoying flair, stupid cosmetics and microtransactions, and a zombie mode that's both unentertaining and broken to all levels of hell.

First off, you can play the classic mode for the game, which plays like regular Counter-Strike (for the most part). Sounds OK, but this is the only thing that I'd consider ""good"" in this game, and that's the fact that you can play a free version of demolition with sexy anime girls and absolute messy UI!

Second, everything else in the game is just not interesting. Like hell I'm gonna spend money on other guns, or stupid cosmetics, or characters, they are completely non-sensical and not needed. The game feels like Counter-Strike, except with a ton of bullshit that has absolutely nothing to do with Counter-Strike.

So let's talk about the zombie mode: It's stupid. It's like the Infection gamemodes in Halo except it's on CS maps. As such, being a zombie absolutely sucks because not only do you have to deal with all of the annoying blood flair spreading around with the UI you have to deal with people using familiar and classic chokepoints/spots in the map to destroy the unarmed zombies.

If you don't have CS: GO or any other way to play Counter-Strike, think of another option. My experience with this game kinda reminds me of Brick-Force, and in many ways that's an absolute bad thing. Brick-Force is the pinnacle of everything wrong with free-to-play games, and now Counter-Strike has a free-to-play version that reminds me a lot of Brick-Force.

Just don't play this game. You'll thank me later.

(This review is an old review released late. At the time of this review being presented I have not played CS Nexon since, and quite frankly, I'd rather not play it again)"
9152,But hey at least the uninstall button works.
9153,Nice game ! :D
9154,"I don't know why people give so many negative reviews for this game, you also can play classic mode, team death match, and ''arms race'' and you can play just this if you want, all that brings a good feeling while you played CS:1.6, CS:S and CS:CZ, and already brings variations of zombie game mode, almost a free CS:GO, I played a few hours, and i realized that's not a pay-to-win, because you can win a lot of weapons and stuff and there's not a powerful weapon, you can kill normally. 1 thing that i don't like is just the skins, like japonese skins and ''anime skins'' really, and some guns is just weird, it's a terrorist against counter-terrorist game, not a fantasy world, but the game itself is great, last thing, the menu is horrible, fix this.

7/10"
9155,It is so bad its good... Great fun with friends who have a sick sense of humor :)
9156,i would love to write a review for this game....... but according to the game i dont have steam sooooo :/
9157,Nice !!
9158,Bullshit
9159,"I entered the main menu,exited the game,and deinstalled it."
9160,awesome game
9161,So u need a hack to play this game uh... Good Job Valve
9162,Fix the dam lag omfg. I'm in the US I join a North American server and mine and everyones ping is 300+ wtf. Nice game but fix the fucking lag problem ffs.
9163,Is good when you don't have money to buy cs go
9164,"This game is not very well, its too buggy and rediculously hard. The game even uses an old game engine that they could of used a better one than this. Most of the gamemodes I find boring and not interesting and some are terrible. I believe that this company could of and should of just made their own but yet used the old Counter Strike engine instead, they could of used the source in my opinion. Also the way of their ban system is crap, why would I get banned for doing well? I didn't use cheats. To me I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, hoped this helped."
9165,i have opened 330 decoders and gotten just shit and all i want is an anime grill why gaben why ;(
9166,"It took me 903 hours  to realise that this game is made for japanese peope cuz all i see is transgender humans , young-girl zombies and sci-fi weapons.Would definetely waste my time again!"
9167,"Fairly good when you get past all the P2W. If you like Counter-Strike and like zombie games, then you should give this a try. It's only P2W if you choose to pay. It's still enjoyable without paying. After all, it's FREE."
9168,"
Shit"
9169,"Free CounterStrike 1.6, Nuff' Said."
9170,Worst game ive played in a while
9171,"Ew, this game is just a run of the mill zombie game with a free to play model strapped on"
9172,"Overall fun gameplay, but fix the directx has failed initialize please."
9173,"I only really picked this back up for 2 reasons: too cheap/poor to buy cs:go, and old discs+new disc drive=shards of plastic
But yeah, counterstrike with new weapons, and annoying skins. I haven't played the zombie mode yet."
9174,amazing
9175,"Nice game whit stupid performance
Fix your fucking servers or let people create their own,even club penguin has better servers"
9176,Couldn't even play it. I kept getting cstrike-online - application error. Too bad...
9177,"Very good game . Even if they do not like it, i just LOVE IT ."
9178,"This game is terrible! 1.The zombies are faster than the survivors impossible to outrun 2. The survivors can get to places where the zombies can't 3. The sucky sound quality of the guy saying ""Supply Drop"" every 30 seconds!"
9179,super
9180,"Its like cs go but with less russians
its like cs go but with cs 1.6 graphics
its like cs go but with less money needed to be spent
its like cs go but with shit zombies
Overall its basicly better than cs go 
10/10 would cs go again"
9181,"Very pathetic excuse for a counter strike game. Not reccomended, theres many more free to play games on Steam."
9182,game sux
9183,It's alright.
9184,"Free counter strike classic plus new maps, and new weapons, AWESOME!!!"
9185,"ahmm, i was so afraid to try this game when i saw all those negative reviews O.o
but, i'm glad i did .. as a counter-strike 1.6 player i like this game so much
it's not pay 2 win, you just need to have some skills, there is a lot of new & cool weapons (tbh there is many crappy guns too :p) & a lot of fun mods, there is Families and Clans (but sadly i can't find any ""english speaking"" one on EU servers).
i like the missions idea but it's still needs a lot of work, i found some bugs but it's not a big deal, i have good ping most of the time (80~60), no lag & i still can play the original 1.6 mod here & ofc it's free :D
what i hate about this game ? the main menu is stuck in a 4:3 resolution (this is really sucks) & it's banned on some countries, some mods are boring/buggy (like when you play soccer sometimes the ball stuck & you can't do anything ""you can't win or lose, just leave the room"") the guns are for limited time, you have 0.001 (not really but i feel it like that) chance to get a permanent one (this sucks too), & the vote kick was removed so ...
i won't speak about graphics bcs i'm a cs 1.6 player ! it's not bad for me, i like it !
anyways, i recommend this game only to players like me, it's a really nice game
and remember : don't judge it regarding to the bad or good reviews, you need to try it by yourself first
Ps: i know many will thumb-down this review :/ pls don't .."

You hate when there was not much zombies in 1.6 or CZ servers?

9194,I would uninstall this again. 10/10
9195,"Love the Balrog weapons,the crafting,the many game modes,and the achievements as well as the daily missions.My only complaint about this game is the fact that the weapons expire after a few days.of course there are the durable items,but I want to be able to keep my weapons without having to use/buy those item expansion coupons or whatever it is.Of course keep the in app purchases available like the decoders and characters,however a purchase-with-points option would be nice and a majority of the items,but If its possible,you should make the weapons permanant (not expirable) and ill give this a perfect score and be able to call this one of the ultimate free-to-play games.I give this an 8.5/10"
9196,"GOOD

-zombie escape

BAD

-EVERYTHING ELSE


BUT FREE CS.16"
9197,"I am a loyal player. I have been playing since 2009. I have seen this game fall from the cloud to the bottom, but today I release this news. I know that the game may not be running for a long time. In fact, as a European and American version, Should not develop too many areas  cause real European players and Russian players to match the high-latency game players seriously affect the game experience, from the first few 1000 people to the current 600 may be the studio's strategic mistakes, but the studio The starting point is good. I want more players to join the game and try to keep the game running. The innocent players in other games in the game itself have caused the original European players to play in other high-latency rooms, more than one hundred. The delay brought a very bad gaming experience, I can't see much European rooms soon on the line, maybe I should give up."
9198,"If anyone played Combat Arms and liked it, you will like this for sure. This game is heavily focused on zombies and the campaign modes are just like in Fireteam in Combat Arms. The challenges are actually tough as well, just like Combat Arms. There are stuff you can buy, but comparing to Combat Arms theres really not much to buy. Theres some, just check in store to see if theres any you like.

To Counter Strike fans, YES there is some original game modes. Such as search and destroy and i think rescue hostages as well. Not to mention returning maps like Dust 2 (I know the majority love that map). This game somewhat look like its trying to steal the original Counter Strikes spotlight lol, BUT i'm sure theres some stuff at the original game has while the other does not. But if you just want to play original Counter Strike game with no mods, this is it for you. Dont like zombies? No problem, they got other modes too than just zombies.

Theres also a level up system too, so you can level up your character and show off to look good in front of other players too.

I recommend this, try it out and I promise it shouldnt waste your time."
9199,"[h1]Disguise a P2W game with ""all the weapons you can get [spoiler](only by limited time)[/spoiler]"" & skinny waifus, it's actually a nice try...[/h1]

9213,"So.. i started to play this game a while ago. stopped playing for some reason that im willing to explain.

Number #1: Bad hit reg, bad servers, P2W af and when i mean af i mean af. so. as i said servers are bad, reg is bad, literally this is not cs. this is a shitty mod for cs 1.6/cz not completed

Number #2: HUDs: They look like they were copied from other games like wolfteam, point blank etc. Not acceptable.

Number #3: There are supposed to be many game modes, but, people just play team dm and they spawn camp ct's in d2. not worth it to play.

Number #4: This game is not CS. This game is a shitty mod for cs 1.6/cz as i said. wasted my time. bugs and glitches. like literally the game sucks.

Number #5: As a cs player: I wouldnt recommend this game.

IF U LOVE THE CS FRANCHISE DONT PLAY IT. ITS GONNA GIVE U AIDS.

0/10 would NOT play again. (notice that NOT)

Edit: After 1-2 years i came back to try it for a little bit. the game still has BAD DESYNC if you're moving with 80+ ping and someone shoots you you'll get dragged back because of ping/bad servers.
after those 1-2 years i havent noticed anything different, everything still bad.
Again, Would NOT recommend this game."
9214,so awsome
9215,this game is really fun :D
9216,Im early let me think of a joke...This game.
9217,"Pretty good game except that when u play as zombies when the humans shoot u, u arent able to move anymore or u move slow. People camp to much during zombie modes. Never have experience lag so i give this game a 9/10"

9268,amzing
9269,do you want a cs 1.6 but getting it for free well there is this game
9270,"can't even play it

10/10 would stare at an error message again."
9271,Simple and Fun game which varies from a zombie team and a human team and you must survive through time thoe thats just the normal game mode Tons of other ones too! And its free And before you give a negative comment the game can be confusing but just give it about 2 hours and you will kick in!
9272,"Ehh, this game is balls, but you can at least count on the exit and uninstall button and getting Cs 1.6 for free.

THANKS KOREA FOR GIVING US OUT-DATED SHITTY GAMES GG"
9273,"Oh god.
Its terrible."
9274,This may have been an ok game like 50yr ago but this game looks so old and outdated it's not even funny. Very poor graphics and audio.
9275,"its good to have fun with friends but has bad garphics
"
9276,"THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER MADE IT ABSOLUTELY SUCKS DONT PLAY IT, EVEN IF YOU'RE BORED ITS JUST HORRIFIC YOU MIGHT DIE

-723000000/10"
9277,Mm... Not so attractive..
9278,this game is totally a fake copy of the zombie mod in crossfire. i for lovers of free to play fps zombie mods i really recommend to play crossfire. and steam by the way your company really should work with crossfire it will be a hell of a fucking game if it will be in steam.thx for reading :D and gl hf
9279,"Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies is a fun game but I could go on for ages about the problems the game has such as pay to win, repetitive boss attacks and other things. On the pay to win subject, instead of cases you get decoders. You can get these for free however by just playing the game or completing missions. I'm pretty sure you have a high chance of getting a good item. Some of the items have a very creative idea, like the Brick Piece, which is a machine gun made out of Lego and can be rebuilt into to a rocket launcher. There are a lot of gamemodes to choose from, but Deathmatch, oh that's bad. This is where the pay to win part sets in. It lets you use some of your items, so if someone has an OP weapon, you are screwed. So if you want to play that properly, don't play until you get some good items. The other gamemodes are good. You have your classic Defusal/Elimination, it wouldn't be CS without it. Arms Race/Gun Game is where you get a kill to get a better weapon. It gives you a chance to use some guns from decoders. There are many more gamemodes to play as well. I think that this is a very good game and I recommend it, especially if you don't have a good enough computer to play Counter Strike: Global Offensive."
9280,its the ONLY free Counter Strike that i got to play buuuuut i recommend WARMODE because that is clearly better then this game but this is FREE so is WARMODE but this game is actualy a really good counter strike
9281,"Do you like counter strike 1.6? Do you like well balenced gameplay? Do you playing a game for more than five minutes without it crashing? Well get the f*uck outta here, this game is unbalenced and crashes a sh*t load more than it should. 

2/10 would crash again"
9282,very nai game
9283,"Pretty fun game, I love zombie games."
9284,This game......

9286,dk
9287,Dobra hra ale az na pay2win
9288,"one of the worst games i ever played...  bad graphics bad gameplay, horrible meue...  just play csgo css"
9289,"People say that this game is ""SHIT."" Well i completely disagree with this opinion, this game has alot of features: (Zombie Scenario, Zombie Hero (Zombie pvp for short), and many more!

Weather you like it or not, IT AINT SHIT ONCE YOU START PLAYING IT FOR A GOOD AMOUNT OF ROUNDS.

So i recommend this game for the grab bag of gamemodes that this game features.
You can also craft weapons for a certain amount of days, and there is an alternative way for getting free weapons, (Decoders for example.) And sure it has some in game purchases, but that hasn't stopped me from playing this. This game is really fun and i think you should try it!"

"
9306,"Ya know, at least TRY and make the game able to be played more than 1 rounds in a row."
9307,I FOCKIN LOVE IT
9308,"An absolute disgrace to the Counter-strike name.

This game was good in 2009-2013 before the release of ""Transcendence weapons""

After that, it was still playable, but when they released ""Epic weapons"" this game turned into the trash tier asian knockoff of a good game that it is, the only difference being that it SOMEHOW got the counter-strike brand slapped onto it.

Skill doesn't matter anymore. Playing this game is like a vomiting contest and the player with the most putrid and the largest amounts of vomit (epic weapons) always wins unless they fuck up. Doesn't matter how you play as a zombie, the human has to fuck up for you to win.

When they realized this, instead of balancing zombies out to make the game more diverse, they had the brilliant idea of introducing the bloater, which lets you spam zombie grenades to deal 50 damage at a time to a 1K hp human at the cost of your own health. so basically, here's the bloater gameplay: Throw zombie bomb at humans > lose hp and generate zombie bomb > regenerate hp > Repeat until humans are either dead or tired of your shit and use deadly shot and whatever the newest vomit (epic weapon) nexon releases.

One great thing is that the uninstall button works."
9309,"Addicting and fun game to play. The funniest CS I have ever played! You don't need to spend money on it to get Premium items and that makes the game even more rare and fantastic. Glad that I found it on Steam! Still only tiny things like: It's difficult to get hold of your dream weapon if you only have a few decoders a day and get lots of useless stuff out of it. But all in all it's a pretty fun game. Tell your friends.
Edit: I don't know what I wrote right there( I guess I was drunk when I wrote this) but it's totally not worth your nerves because some players are so damn annoying and retarded that they can't even speak english (80% of the CSN:Z Community contains Turks there are 3 Turk servers but they are still in the European servers). 2nd you pay 5 Euro for ""PREMIUM"" Decoders which contains to 85% SH!T 70 days weapons and the other ""15%"" are Rare premium items :'D but that's not true (50% of Premium weapons contains useless/pointless gold weapons with no changed stats or something like this what makes them pointless to use.) Well and in the decoder they say: ""A high chance to get something rare..."" Yeah wow Gold weapons are just worthless, the other ones are unreachable and the other sh!t is weapons for 70 days yay(They are called PREMIUM decoders and gives you a damn Janus grenade launcher which makes no damage at all and is weak ass, but nevermind Nexon the Brick Piece V2 is for everyone who pays over 5900$ in this game to get it right? What's the point in buying Premium Decoders for 5 bucks if you still know that a 70 days weapon awaits you. The game keeps insisting to give you, the weapon you really want but again. Waste lots of money in this game and you are guranteed to get a inventory full of 70 days weapons.) And this is way too . ---> Bingo you have the chance to get your weapon from Mileage (Problem: You have to waste 90000 Mileage to get your wish Grand Prize because almost everytime you change the grand Prize a damn gold weapon shows up. So you wasted a lot of money just because you want another Grand Prize and no sh!t gold weapon. GG Nexon absoloute not worth my nerves and money. Do it better and I'll forgive you. 
PS: Overpowered weapons are no Fun ;) (Cyclone) This weapons shoots straight and instantly hits the targets what makes gun fights with it pointless. All in all it's pointless to even look at the page store it's wasting time and I know what I'm talking about I've spent 142 hours to make a clear picture of this game and still have no clue what the fuuucking is going on with the prices in the store. I mean you pay much to get nothing for your lifetime. It's like: Hey look have 2 months fun with this weapon and then never again. Nexon if you see this: MY REVIEW IS LONG BUT WORTH READING IT AND OVERWORK YOUR CHANCES IN GETTING SOME REAL GOOD STUFF."
9310,Uinstall button works!! :D
9311,"After staying away from this game for some time, here I am finding out that I lost my inventory that I wasted money on like an idiot.

Thanks for teaching me not to waste money on P2W games."
9312,cool
9313,As if u got the 19s graphics and made it counter strike
9314,"Worst mod ever, -10/10.

I just started playing and I'm bombarded with F2P crap. This has barely anything to do with Counter-Strike other than basic gameplay, it's literally that minus the fun. With zombies. Oh and don't even think about loading custom maps or anything into it, it's locked down completely."
9315,So  bad
9316,"on some Pc¬¥s its doesnt start. (not on my) IF it starts its shit





                                                     3/10"
9317,Dont download it!!!
9318,"Eh Sorta good game
For people who really like zombies"
9319,This game is a good game for people that love First Person shooters and if you have a crapy computer that can't run like anything.
9320,"So many hacks, you can't simple play sometimes because of that, what a waste, this game used to be awesome."
9321,This game is shit because i can't even get it to work.
9322,WHY IS THIS ON THE MOST POPULAR LIST?????
9323,"Firstly the game has really poor graphics, boring after a while and is for little children. Secondly, the game is alright but you have to buy things with real money, this problem is alright and just play for free. Secondly, their support is extremly bad, I left the game a long time ago (when there was no hacks even made yet) to play other games that I had more interest in and when I came back because I saw my friend playing it agian I saw that aparrently I have been banned by a retarded GM. Had to waste time to create a account (10 minutes), spend time on creating the ticket and add important information (20 minutes), wait for a reply (99 months+).

Bottom of line is that the game is made for reatarded kids. Really badly planned and designed."
9324,"Simply put, this is the Korean take Counter-Strike's zombie mode. It has the same old engine as Counter Strike 1.6 as well as the other versions. The gameplay is, as you'd expext, the same like in Counter Strike. The only difference is that the Counter Terrorists are named Survivors and the Terrorists are Zombies. But, where Counter Strike Nexon Zombies lacks in graphics and gameplay, it makes it up with abundant ammount of content, many gamemodes to explore, and provides the player with hours of fun. There is so much content in this game that I'd swear it'll take ages for me to get them all. Sure, most of it has to be payed for but you can still get them by winning theme as prizes. The game provides multiple zombie modes, story modes, and classic free to play FPS game modes. This game is fun to play even when you're alone, though it can be unforgiving and unfair at some points. But with friends it is hours of laughter and shooting guns. If you enjoy the 1.6 and older versions of Counter Strike, you will definetly enjoy Counter Strike Nexon Zombies - because it's not so much different from it, but still provides much fun to the player."
9325,This game is horrrible. It lacks any sort of tutorial for new players and has inconsistent gameplay. It is impossible to play if you are brand new to this game
9326,"This game sucks now! I have been seeing a lot of hackers recently! Such as speed hack, waller and so on. Can nexon game support fix this damn problem? Or they will lose a lot of good players in no time!"
9327,"It's a pretty decent game, Both sides are equally matched (Except for campers sitting away from their teammates where nobody can find them for the whole game and if you are skilled, you can even counter that) Don't like the zombies killing you? Play an original mode, Don't like people shooting at you? Would you rather stay in the shadows? Play The Hidden gamemode, Don't like any of them? Play something else, The zombies are rather well put together considering the games graphics, The only thing I would change would be in Zombie Darkness the normal zombies be allowed to climb for as long as they want, Or you could improve graphics, Either way: 9/10 for a good game."
9328,"world best game ever

"
9329,i have already played this game    and it takes me back to 1.6  so mcuh    and its free ?!?!
9330,"The game is good.
A lot of spawn campers.
but..
..CAN YOU PLEASE EXTEND THE SPAWN PROTECTION TO 5 SECONDS?!
Thanks."
9331,"Has a builtin keylogger that if you open the gamer and close it normally. It keeps open a small program that records your keystrokes and so. I'd like you to consult the makers of this game and ask them why do they have this in their game. Becuase i don't want my club penguin account stolen, it has very expensive items on it. Also my Runescape has lots of gear that costs billions of coins, gold coins. You may think im trolling but im not. This is a serious issue, and i don't want to lose my club penguin."

9337,"The game is ok, great for low end pcs, full of microtransactons which is expected in a f2p but they dont hinder your enjoyment of the game"
9338,Appualing 10/10 don't install
9339,"Not only does this game bring back the memories of playing one of the first counter strike games, it also brings in an array of new weapons, maps and gamemodes. All based around a very popular topic for FPS games. Zombies!"
9340,"yes
"
9341,hovadina
9342,Quite bad
9343,"I wouldn't recommend even taking a look at this game, it's just horrendously bad. The interface is let's just say over complicated for a game like this it generally looks bad and the design probably scares off 45% of the people who downloaded the game, if that was the only downside of CSN:Z then the game would be fairly alright but well, it's not. I will just remind that the game is supposed to be focused on the zombie genre, but there's still loads of games based on the CS 1.6 formula(Terrorist vs Counter-Terrorist), the idea was good, but was quickly ruined, they should've use the a normal matchmaker(like the one in CoD) instead of players making their own sessions and waiting 20 minutes for someone to join. After that there is the totally unbalanced gameplay, where humans have a big advantage over zombies when they shouldn't, that totally ruins the 'fun'. Anyways, there is also the problem of really bad sounds and graphics. I know that the game is based on CS 1.6 but seriously! I'm starting to think that The Legend of Zelda is a better game and that is not something to be proud of, textures have low resolutions and are generally horrific the sounds are not better either. So to be honest, if you want to play a good zombie game(for free) get Codename: Cure.
1/10

9344,"i love this game
and i  have csgo"
9345,"nice game, if you got the time to grind"
9346,best game out of all i could say but hey im a noobie so ima lket the pros judge on that
9347,"i never review games but i had to this time, this game is so bad. its purely pay to win, the online is sketchy, and the zombies mode is terrible. if i wanted to pay for counter strike id pay for counter strike, -10/10 uninstalled"
9348,"This is the absolutely worst game ive ever played.. and that does mean something cause i played shit like big rigs over the road racing... well at least this game has physics. it has everything from ugly looking textures (i know its cs 1.6 but even some really bad mmofps have better grapics AND THE ZOMBIES ARE SO FUCKING BAD YOU CAN EVEN GET A ZOMBIE SKINS WITH STRAPONS AND of course a gas mask on) to extremely high pay2win... you can buy retarded anime skins because there are some weird guys who buy them cause they look ""sexy"" but idk how they can find them sexy even if they look like plastic figures, the only thing with them is that theyre harder to hit. some golden akimbo weapons and even damn railguns, guns that will oneshot you without a problem. the animations are the worst ive ever seen too because they used the least amout of animations(idk why) so that if a character model is moving to the right it can instantly switch to the left without an animation thats why i find it harder to hit enemies. So to sum it up : from the money you spent for this game you couldve bought yourself csgo or a rope to hang yourself because you wasted your money on this sh*t. seriously anybody who wastes his whole money on this game should be brought to the asylum. you shouldnt play this game if you want to live a normal life... dont do it... please let this game die

sorry for offensive language"
9349,no
9350,"Would REALLY recommend. Worth a try. A great game for having fun with friends. Lots of gamemodes like original counter-strike, zombie ecscape and many many more. Lots of fun to be had, really recommend!"

9372,0/10
9373,"This game is great. It's free counterstike, which is awesome. My one con for now is the recent adittion of perfect enhancement boxes. It gives a 100% chance to upgrade a weapon. This is only available in the store. Obviously, this added a huge P2W element to this game. Other than that, it relatively easy to obtain powerful weapons, so ppl paying to get those weapons don't really have much of an advantage there. If you want to try out counter strike, or just don't want to pay for it, this game is perfect for you. P.S. this is the only counter strike i've seen that also has zombies. :)"
9374,"Pensavo fosse bellino, mi devo ricredere.
Gi√† il fatto che pi√π della met√† dei player consiglierebbe questo gioco √® un fatto inconcepibbbile, poi se vuoi fare un gioco nel 2015, non usare un Engine di 22 anni fa,(GoldSrc).
Questo gioco dovrebbe vincere il primo premio per la Pay-to-Win-aggine.
Significa che nello shop puoi comprare cose anche per 500, per esempio un mitra od un fucile, e con quell'arma ammazza in un colpo prendendoti i peli del naso, invece quelli che cercano di far pesare il portafogli sono molto meno fortunati...
10¬∞ partita che gioco:
Uccisoni = 21
Morti = 172
Poi √® pieno di hacker, uno shoppato fiero mi ha ucciso in un colpo solo con un AK-47(dorato) da due anni luce di distanza ed avevo salute piena.
Sappiate che chi ti uccide ogni due per tre non √® il classico veterano, ma uno che ha soldi da sprecare, sia in cazzi e smazzi tra cui fucili, cappelli a forma di C==3 oppure in hacks(perch√® anche loro costano eh).
Votate di no a questo degrado della storia videoludica.
Zeb89 per una volta ha ragione."
9375,"This is actually a good game with good balance between play and pay to win. If you play on a regular basis you can unlock weapons permanently, and various skins. SO most of the complaints here are made by people that played the game 1 hour and didn`t get the best weapons...."
9376,ghfg
9377,not bad!:)
9378,Not worth it
9379,cool game gg volvo
9380,People have been being a little harsh on this game and i'll tell you why. First the zombie game mode in this game is absolute ass but the other game modes such as team death match are really fun. So they worked harder on game modes like tdm harder than zombies. So i see why people say it sucks but really if you want to play the half life mod for free this is the game you get.
9381,I've been a long time player so I do have decent weapons in this game but if you are new it's almost next to impossible to get a weapon that can do enough damage to get a single kills without spending any money. This game is way too pay to win and the only way you can get anything is to dedicated hours on end for months to rack up enough mileage to buy a good weapon in their auction.

-Cheaters everywhere

-There isn't anything like a league system so in most cases you don't play with people who have got about the same skill as you

-This game is pay to win because you can get premium weapons by paying real money. These premium weapons flatten you. There's nothing you can do as a rookie

Frankly the idea of this game is good so playing against bots or friends is the only way to make this game worth playing it. If you have some money leftover I recommend you to better buy CS:GO"

9393,Horrible Graphics and kinda confusing

I maybe dumb or something but I literally had no idea what the fuck was going on when I joined my first server.

9411,"fun
"
9412,"dont play this game, its shit. too much pay 2 win, other than that its good but i dont recommend it."

9422,"Where should I start with this review? Hmmm.......

This game is basically a more fun version of Counter Strike 1.6, now I know what your going to say, so take off you nostalgia caps and listen to me for a minute. The reason I am saying this is a more fun version of CS 1.6 is because there is actually more to do in this game than in CS 1.6. Shall I list some examples? Ok.

1. Level up system, which gives you more of a motivation to keep playing this game.
2. Rank system, which makes you want to always get better and better.
3. More gun choice, This game has loads of guns and most of them make sense to add in this game.
4. More game modes, I can't really name any at the top of my head. But there are a lot of game modes to choose from.
5. Zombies! Now I don't play zombies often but a lot of people really do like it.

Those are not even all the examples I could list.

Moving on...

I don't like it when the haters or even the people who like this game says it is Pay2Win. It is definitely NOT P2W because I am better than most people who pay in this game and I have not spent a single penny on this game. Free players and spenders obtain guns the same way, the only difference is that for free players, it take a little longer to obtain the weapons because you have to do missions and level up. That is about the only disadvantage you have against spenders in this game, I think the developers did a good job about doing that.

Some bad things about this game is that it is glitchy sometimes. I have only noticed glitches in zombies mode though. When you are a zombie and you are getting shot, you for some reason stop and then you can move, so if you are getting shot by a machine gun, you will have a hard time finding cover or chasing after them to kill them. That is about the only glitch I have found in this game so far.

I will update this if I find anything else I find good or bad about this game."
9423,game is pretty cool but.. i bought a costume item to see if i got somthing cool but no i got a squirrel tail and then i bought 2 decoders got a terrible gun for 7 days and an alright sniper for 30 i thing people who purchase things should a better chance to get better items and i see people with a cool fish that i would honestly pay for
9424,"dick tickle

9425,"great....played for 10 minutes, but somehow i have 11.7 hours on record"
9426,"Deleteed all account information for users who did not log in from march to april 2018. All CD-keys for DLC that have been used are still marked as used so you can't even get the starter pack.

I know nexon has some shady practices but holy shit man"
9427,"-Cons
Why is this still using 1.6 Engine? For the love of god upgrade to Source engine at LEAST. 
Why the hell is this game so freakin weird? Oh yeah, its made by a japanese studio, who would've guessed.
The graphics are far too outdated, zombies are way too op, nearly all maps have unfair exploits, the game is another god dammed Pay to win, you feel outmatched compared to other players who have far better weapons than you, some weapons you unlock only last for a few days, which is hands down the most pathetic money milking idea anybody on Earth could come up with

-Pros
It can be quite fun at times, especially when you call for backup and multiple teammates come rushing to help you, Zombie escape is so much fun to play and it is extremely well done, Zombie Hero (main gamemode) Can be fun, but most of the time the zombie wins because of their ridiculously over the top abilitys, this is literally free 1.6, as you can go onto ""Basic"" servers and play CS 1.6 the classic way

I would recommend it, but its a pay to win, so... ew."
9428,It's 0K.
9429,"There are problems with this game, but it is really not as bad as most of the reviews say (Keep in mind, the bad reviews are written mostly by CS: GO fantards)

Pros:
Free to play
NOT pay to win
HUGE arsenal of weapons (from AK-47's to guitar guns)
Many new maps & gamemodes
Not much lag at all (Of course this depends on the computer/laptop you have, but I'd say an average computer can run it smoothly)

Cons:
Run on a 16 year old engine (Hey, thats why its free)
You cannot make your own maps (See above)
Not made by Valve (Not gonna lie NEXON, that isn't cool)
For CS: S and CS: GO players, this might be a bit difficult for you to get used to

Neutral:
There aren't many English-speaking players out there (Of course this isn't much of a probem, I just feel that English-speaking players who are quite tactical and want to convey a plan to the rest of their team may not be able to do so, if they can't speak the language the majority of the server is speaking).

Honestly, I would get this game, its free. I would even say to play this game, but play CS:S, and/or CS: GO too! Why not? They are all good games anyway.
"
9430,Wtf is this shit
9431,gg
9432,good game best <3
9433,this game dose seem like a free rip of mod of CS but its fun crapy but fun CS guns some CS maps but its still fun there is a slight pay to win facter or so it seemed but i do think you can do just fine with the base guns.
9434,gr8
9435,"i love it i dont get why poeple hate it and say the exit button works for me its good to play a game thats old like but good make more with nexon
"
9436,"Very good game, and fun with friends."
9437,"Very good and funny, good for playing with friends 

8/10"
9438,"GAME IS GOOD! BUT..
at 1st when i close game it's still run on background (eat my CPU like a monster)
2nd: when i try to open game it: a) open and say ""Error ...""
                                                      b) fail to connect to game host
                                                      c) say nothing and not open, just run on background and do nothing."
9439,"After the latest update they fucked up bad,the ""migration"" to KOREAN server's cause were too fucking poor to keep up EU server's even though we make few million annually but noo we gotta do it our own way and bring it back to the ROUTS.All this fucking game ever did was just suck money out of your wallet and make you frustrated at the people who dropped sweat just to be good at this game but now with this fucking migration update they have no chance of getting back into the industry.Instead of hiding it and saying ""oh yeah you're account is gone"" send the people emails who haven't played the game for months to notify that ""we cant pay for our servesr anymore"" instead of you coming back one day and you have to do all the shit you've already done all over again.

PS:I've spent my share fair amount of money in this fucking game and now this is making me regret all of it,hope the fucking company just falls into a deep pit where the there is no way out and it ""MIGRATES"" away with no backtrail."
9440,My name is Jeff
9441,This game sucks
9442,Fun for 0 minutes
9443,"After a certain ammount of crafting/enhancing, the game will purposly throw failiures and level downs at your face. This isn't a glitch because if it was, they would be trying to fix it, so if you don't know why that allways happens, blame Valve and Nexon for making a game full of no's and hackers. If you like those types of games, this is the game for you. But if you're like me, you're going to gate this game."
9444,Worst Counter Strike game ever
9445,"This game is actually pretty fun to play and I wouldn't say it's Pay2Win either.

Even a good Counter-Strike player can kill anyone with the default 1.6 weapons as opposed to someone with new guns.

While it's true that some weapons won't last forever when you craft them or earn them, there are ways to own them ""permanently."" So if you get a gun that will only last for a few days, don't give up hope. You'll get a gun that you'll love and will have permanently sooner or later.

The gameplay plays just about the same as Counter-Strike: Condition Zero. With the new addition being zombies of course.

Most of the stuff you buy with real money are just cosmetics and new skins. Not many items that are important will require real money. If you don't mind a little grind. The grind on here is not all that bad either. You can achieve what you want through a few hours of play.

My only gripe is that this game uses server migration. I really hate this because, when the host of the server leaves, another player is selected to be the host. If it randomly selects me, people have to put up with my crappy internet connection and get tons of lag. Server migration is bad because, it makes it unfun having to select a player that's not fit for hosting games, but rather for joining games.

I'd say give this game a shot. It's still fun to play just like Counter-Strike 1.6. Plus it's free so, you'll get your chance of trying out the game before you start spending real money on it."
9446,Good game but very unbalanced against zombies and terriosts win nearly every round thanks to the ak47.. they should make it so counter terriosts get the stg44
9447,this game is a piece of crap wen i first played it i thot is was for atari the graphics are that bad the most annoying thing is wen the voice says abunch of lines and each line says zombies like 7 times its so annoying if u want a good counter srike game get globle offensive not this crap
9448,"This game is a complete Rip off and a Joke. They will have a sale you will buy stuff. They will get ""Hacked"" you lose everything you got from the items you bought and for a week they will give you excuses and do nothing in the end. Steam will not refund your money because you got the item you purchused. Just not the items that the purchused product was suppost to give. Everything in the game is buyable specificly expt for the USA sever. The only way to get those items on the USA sever is the 1 in 10k chance of a ""decoder"" that if you use a hundred you will most likely never get anything out of them. The purchuse system in this game is a total scam."
9449,"Spent ¬£10 and i don't even get to keep the weapons ripoff
Still good gameplay"
9450,My exit button doesn't even work. Send help. Please.
9451,Awesome
9452,eh
9453,The main menu is already complicated for me
9454,Worst game I've ever played.
9455,"I left a positive review because I didn't have much negative to say about it. It's a decent game. Nothing like Black Ops II Zombies, but still, for a free game, it's decent.

Graphics are average, gameplay is average, and it requires an average system to run it. Give it a shot if you're new."
9456,"Imagine all the bad things of L4D without any of the good things of L4D...

In other words: Don't play this game, and don't make your friends play this game, unless you're a bad friend in which case F-uck you, literally F-uck you..."
9457,"its fun
"
9458,"A friend of mine asked me: ""Hey du you want to play the most shit CS game ever?"" and i installed CS Nexon Zombies.

Its a F2P CS 1.6, with all the F2P features you can imagin. When you start up the game, you have to decide with game mode you want to play.
There a several Zombie COOP-modes and some shit you already saw in every CS game like DM, TDM, Original CS etc. The COOp modes i played were the worst experiance with any COOP ever. Either you have to run from them or you are shooting wave after wave of them. This gets interrupted by walls you have to shoot down. these got like 30k hp and you need around 2-6 Minutes. Seriously witch cun7 had the idea to make players shoot multiple wall for minutes in a Coop mission. 

The Orininal CS mode is the only one you may play, without getting bored to death. There is even matchmaking, but nobody plays it. The community seems more likely to play it 16v16 on seperate servers, than to play the game like its meant to be played. So don't even think about playing this for original. If you are intreted in cs just buys CSS or CSGO in a few $$.

But the worst thing about this game are the F2P-""Features"". These i will just list up.
- non-permanent Weapon shop
- Weapons are aquired via crafting
- Female player skins for 9,99$ 
- Weapons include thing like Grenade launchers ans Gatling-guns (in a CS title WTF?)
- MM dosen't work or nobody is playing it

Just don't play this crap, it's worse than condition zero."
9459,"I had a bad review for this when it came out, but after a while i redownloaded and its actually pretty dam awsome. its like 90% free and very litle pay to win. Play it cause its old cs with a bunch of other sh** added on. Just a fun game to play and not to take seriousely."
9460,esta merda e like joga eu deixo
9461,whach out people zombie gams are cool but the zombie games wich you can be a zombies are much cooler!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111!!!!!1111!!!!!!1!!1111!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9462,"Well, it seems they deleted all former accounts. Cool.  There goes my 400 hours in this game. Screw you Nexon"
9463,This game is horrible. i have no clue why people play this crap.....
9464,Crashed when opened :L
9465,"This game is pretty fun to play while listening to long youtube videos or if you are looking to pass time. I found it really addicting for a few days, but now It's more of an occasional pass time activity."
9466,Es okay to play the 1.6 stuff I guess
9467,"Ignore the hate, this game is good."
9468,this game gave me cancer. it is stuck in 4x3 resolution so if you dont have a square monitor it is nearly impossible to play. also it has micro transactions and that makes it feel like a bad mobile game.it might be fun if you could see more than the top left 1/4 of your screen.
9469,"A very interesting game.
Got me into the actual game CS:GO
and I love going on Razer Synapsye and getting a auto bunny button thing and fly around the map!"
9470,Entertaining and Exciteing every time
9471,"the thing is before the match making update the game was lag free no delays and no other game play damaging thing, after it have lags so hard that i can play it any longer.
when i play, the game lags so hard that when i play zombie scenario or tdm i cant play it because from time to time i have this hardcore lags that i dont know from where els they can come then from the server, i have a perfekt ping of 34-64 but the thing is i lag still.
nexon when you read this pls redo the match making update and put back the old server list pls it was way better then this pls 
sometimes i ask myself why not play another round"
9472,"Really, really awful game. I won't even speak about graphics, but the same minute as you turn on your client it looks like flash game. Items are buyable with money and that's just silly. And most important thing is how zombies movement is done. When humans are shooting at zombie, he's unable to move at all, not even back. Im not even talking about shooting delays, recoils and stupidity of this game. Well done, Nexon!"
9473,"The ""OK"" button on the error message was codded perfectly it exited the game fast... 

11/8 Would play for the error again."
9474,i like it cus its free i put most of my money in tf2 for in game items lol but still its good game
9475,"the graphics are crappy, the gameplay is awkful, after one game i uninstalled. Would not recommend"
9476,I would love to tell you how bad this game was. But I couldn't make it past the main menu. Game kept crashing while I was trying to adjust the settings.
9477,"wp
"
9478,its k
9479,"its cool not bad but its a confusing game
"
9480,"1 of my favorite games  im never gonna stop it , but some of the characters missing and i don't know how to get them or buy them."
9481,"it sucks i cannot play the game at all
"
9482,its a good game
9483,Great game for being free. Highly under rated.
9484,This game ruined counter-strike. This doesnt feel like a counter-strike game. 1. The graphics look like their from counter-stike 1.3 or 1.6. 2. Too many microtransactions. 3. The teams are uneven. 4. Why make a zombie standalone game when you can play on a modded zombie map on any of the counter-strikes! Thats why I dont recommend this game. I 100% recommend all the other counter-strike games but NOT this! Dont get me wrong I love counter-strike but this game ruined it.
9485,"Ok...

So I went into the game,  got an ak-47

after 1 min of playing....

UNINSTALL"
9486,"It's Counter Strike, but free. But don't let the small trailers get you, it runs on GoldSource (Half-Life Engine) not Source. And with the availability to customize your character and choose unique weapons. But the weapons can be overly powerful and can ruin a good online experience. It's just, again, free Counter Strike with more game modes and more choices to make."
9487,lol
9488,this game is some much fun but the netcode is off fix it plz
9489,U get Counter Strike 1.6 for free. What are you waiting for!?
9490,I Love Game :D
9491,You get Counter-Strike 1.6 for free. Stop complaining.
9492,"If you like killing zombies and doing team deathmatch's well this is the game for you, but try not acting too cool. everyone will try killing you the most and you might commit Homocide (in game). The fun thing about it kinda has the same textures that the first counterstrike had, and its free."
9493,i didnt like it at all and i love csgo
9494,The 'exit game' button worked.
9495,"If you want to play counter-strike differently and you want to play it free, so this could be something for you. My gameplay is only 48 minutes long, but for few hours of gameplay it could be suitable. Most stupid on this game is probably too high health of zombies and not so much ammo when you play on server with 20 or more people. When you become a zombie, you are not scared about so many ammo the other players shooting to you. On the other side, have you ever seen a zombie film, where zombies were scared of soldiers? Me neither, so it is allright.  I will not recommend it for more than few hours of gameplay, after that time, game starts to be boring..."
9496,"This game is really fun to play and it is really well made, with all of the gamemodes and hundreds of weapons this game was really well pulled off. Even though the graphics are not that good it sure is more fun than all of the other counter-strike games.


 I GIVE IT 5 STARS!"
9497,.
9498,"Im not a big fan of Zombie mode, but this Counter Strike seems to be ok. So I recommend it!"
9499,"Really needs to be Optimized, Otherwise it's Amazing in every single way."
9500,"Personally I still can't stand the idea of hip-firing only and no aiming down your sights but I'm told that's what CS is known for so ehhh.

I dunno why people bash on this game I mean all I've been doing is logging in and chancing at raffles and lottery-style stuffs and in 2 years I've recieved 2 free permanent hero characters, 7 free permanent golden guns, 3 free scifi-esque permanent guns, and 14 different free standard permanent guns. This game has been doing nothing but spoiling me and I never spent a cent, I'm quite happy.

It's free Counter-Strike 1.6 with online support, constant updates for new materials, and the zombie things people only farm to get more free things. I mean you really don't have to play the Nexon cheese sloshed all over it.

All in all, don't read these reviews any further and just try the game out yourself being it's free :P I'll warn you the main menu and UI gets buggy and weird but the gameplay is rather solid."
9501,This sucks on ice
9502,I love this game!!
9503,Klasik cs bb
9504,What the fuck is this game..?
9505,"This says Counter-Strike Zombies. This is most definetly not a counter-strike, instead a BS attempt at looking like a counter-strike game.
Pros-
-There are none. i played this for an houre and a half and fond nothing goof about this terrible game.

Cons-
-craphics are poor
-people who are alive are OP, while the players who end up zombies are like a box of tissues
-guns are not balanced. the whole human team can basicly stand in one spot and shoot at the zombies and ittle push them back.
-looks and feels like another game nexon failed miserable at (combat arms)

Summery
-find the person who runs nexon, and throw splooge at him"
9506,the zombies part of this game kinda sucks :p but i play it sometimes just for like cs 1.6 for free :p
9507,"Graphics are outdated, not worth your money to spend on also its one sided on teams."
9508,"hey, does this game even launch? i've had this problem since august 23, 2015."
9509,"Although the zombie portion of the game is absolute shite, the Classic portion of the game is actually pretty good.

It's basically Condition Zero for free!"
9510,Counter-Strike Weeaboo Edition.
9511,Counter Strike with zombies and animu boobs.
9512,Very repetitive gameplay but at least it's free.
9513,Amazing as

9523,"good if you dont have CS 1.6 and just want to see how it used to play.
even though the graphics are not good by todays standards, it is still fun to play every now and then and the zombie gamemodes and great"
9524,"I will be honest I love the game. I did feel pushed to spend money to get different weapons but, it is very fun. It may be like a copy of cs:go but I picked this because it was ""free"" compared to 15$ and I do not regret it. It had many fun gamemodes that I love such as the Zombie Hero mode.

Me and my friend loves playing this game. we loved it even more when we would get decoders from missions for free but sadly I dont play it as much because they got rid of this. I rate it 7/10 for some reasons but for a free game I would recommend it."
9525,ok it started now and its pretty fun

9551,"Hi! I dont see why people dont like this game, as it is a freetoplay CS:Go basically! I play it alot so yeah... Its good"
9552,"I bought a RPG for 5‚Ç¨ It said it was (permanent)...
Go in the game.

1. The rpg had a time limit on 1 month.
2. The rpg only did damage if you hit the enemy on there body (No aoe)
3. I contacted the Dev and asked them to fix it... it's now been half a year and they still don't care
4. Tried the game after a break. Now i can't even run it.

Don't play this. It's dead...

0/10 (it's just a big corporate scam)

-Update 16/06-2018-

Just tried it again... I have lost everything... EVERYTHING. Every houre i slaped into the game and all the IRL cash i used on decoders (loot box's). Due to a server migration that i diden't notice.

If you think this game is something for you give it a try. (It's free after all)
But if you ask me. STAY AWAY from ANYTHING that has to do with Nexon.

0/10 (im just fucking done.)"
9553,"now, usually i reccomend games, but thats not the case here, this game, is awful, for one
it uses textures from the first or second counterstrike, second of all, the not good awful very bad voice acting, 
for being made last year, it should have the best voice acting, but its not sadly, and finally, nexon and valve put together
makes a dildo covered in shit, separate, they are great developers
so do i reccomend this game, hella no"
9554,"Ok so i used to play this game ages ago and had a blast.. and then i went back to it and looked at my team getting thrashed in spawn even under spawn protection. This game is fun for a while but i repeat do not install it if you think this game will last you a while because it will not.

Transactions with CS 1.6 but.. with zombies and oh.. bragging rights ranks. 

The only good thing this only has is zombies and a starter pack you get for free. 

Don't get me wrong i had my time with this game but it has no place for me now anymore. ;_;

RIP GOOD GAME."
9555,"best DLC for it is ""Delete Local Content"""
9556,good game!
9557,"Three words, This is bullshit."
9558,sht
9559,"I have so much fun playing this game right when i got it it was a bit confusing but its easy to figure out
"
9560,"I got a decent size arsenal of perm weapons and paid nothing to get them. It's called ""Do the events and get rewarded"". And best of all, events are free(as in you don't have to pay anything to be a part of them) and usually pretty simple to do. You just have to be able to catch them when they begin, and finish before they end. No worries though, you usually have about 2 to 4 weeks to finish from beginning to end. I like most of the modes they have available to play. Sure, paying can help a bit with weapon selection maybe, but its not going to make your hand/eye coordination any better (unless, you know, you get like some bionic implant in your hand or something O.o). It can get you some better ping though, and thats one major factor that takes a toll on how well you are playing. Kinda like just about any online game. Oh yeah.... come get rekt in Zombie Giant muahahah *cough* Sorry!"
9561,"ITS FREAKIN RETARTED DO NOT DOWNLOAD I!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"
9562,worst game ive ever played
9563,If you have craving to play an interesting well made shooter. DONT PLAY THIS. the matchmaking is unfair. the only fair game mode is survival anything else you will be picked apart by aimbots and wallers. might have been a good game... if some real efforts were put into it.
9564,"This game sucks. It's a pay to win game, Where u waste your money and just get OP weapons and the game is unplayable. And getting the starter pack is STUPID. I enter the code the game gave me but it says incorrect amount of numbers. So this game is the worse CS game. It's even worse then the first counter strike game. NEXON SUCKS SO DON:T GET THERE IDIOTIC GAMES."
9565,"The Uninstall Button Works !!!!!

Very usefull when you want to waste time!

"
9566,Better cinematic then acuall game play
9567,"I do recommend this game, but there is a glitch where it will say you are playing it. But you aren't. And it won't let you play Nexon ..... But overal it's a good game, alot of maps, alot of fun gamemodes."
9568,Nice game..... BUT need to keep your net at top speed to play...
9569,"this is not counter-strike 
you cannot Bhop
-10/10"
9570,its ok
9571,GOOD GOOD GAME  but the game needs some work
9572,Fun.
9573,"oh man the graphics reminds me of cs 1.6 HOLY SHIET LOOK AT DEM GREPHICS quote from jontron idc if i got part of it wrong 

its a good game will play again 10/10"
9574,this is the kind of game that people look at the reviews and look and this game is by far the worst of its kind
9575,"This game brings me back to the old days of Counter-Strike, Graphics don't matter, they have an interesting system to keep us doing challenges and having us gamble items for a chance to get something amazing, not all agree it is very good, but i think its a great game, and i suggest anyone wanting to try a new game i suggest this one, it has its moments with the servers but it is still fun to play! And its better with friends so go make some! Trust me it has its moments where it does get bad and you hate it but it can still be enjoyable! Any questions just ask me!

Now why dont you press install and see what you think.

(also this game is CSO (Counter Strike: Online) but the Mid West version for us to play, So dont hate to much like it for what it has and not for what it dosent its great on pretty much all pcs and it has its interesting ways of keeping you playing! Have Fun Survivors/Infecters!)"
9576,"Basically it's cs1.6 with worse graphic, made pay to win, and shooting doors for 10 minutes in zombie mode. Don't play this game. Or do, I really liked the zombie mode about 3 years ago. You're better off buying counter strike source or global offensive for the price of 8 euros on sale. Also the survival gamemode is something you need try, because I loved it.
Hope this review was helpful."
9577,SUKA BLYAT i started playig this game and i taugh is good right then it comes up that is faking shit blyat dont dowload this shit
9578,nice exit button xD
9579,"its cool i like it but the zombies are kind of ...
"
9580,Its a fun free to play game and has low requirements.
9581,Counter-Strike+Weapon Crafting+Microtransactions=Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies
9582,cool game!!!
9583,This game is about as much fun as someone stealing your wallet.
9584,omg the starter pack is free
9585,"Ha! Did I catch you off guard with this positive review?
Nah, just wanted to show the developers what a thumbs up looks like.

This game blows ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•."
9586,">Comes back after 3 months
>Joins 25 servers
>Each one speaks spanish
>-10/10 cant speak spanish"
9587,If you aren't that great at Counter Strike: Global Offensive then this is the game for you! I have yet to meet someone in this game who isn't completly terrible.
9588,To me it is hard but its is easy at the same time i would Love Them to make another one o these!
9589,"why not? its free and fun i like hosting lobbies with my friends to mess around and kill eachother

10/10 Would play again

-IGN"
9590,"ahmm, i was so afraid to try this game when i saw all those negative reviews O.o
but, i'm glad i did .. as a counter-strike 1.6 player i like this game so much
it's not pay 2 win, you just need to have some skills, there is a lot of new & cool weapons (tbh there is many crappy guns too :p) & a lot of fun mods, there is Families and Clans (but sadly i can't find any ""english speaking"" one on EU servers).
i like the missions idea but it's still needs a lot of work, i found some bugs but it's not a big deal, i have good ping most of the time (80~60), no lag & i still can play the original 1.6 mod here & ofc it's free :D
what i hate about this game ? the main menu is stuck in a 4:3 resolution (this is really sucks) & it's banned on some countries, some mods are boring/buggy (like when you play soccer sometimes the ball stuck & you can't do anything ""you can't win or lose, just leave the room"") the guns are for limited time, you have 0.001 (not really but i feel it like that) chance to get a permanent one (this sucks too), & the vote kick was removed so ...
i won't speak about graphics bcs i'm a cs 1.6 player ! it's not bad for me, i like it !
anyways, i recommend this game only to players like me, it's a really nice game
and remember : don't judge it regarding to the bad or good reviews, you need to try it by yourself first
Ps: i know many will thumb-down this review :/ pls don't .."
9591,"I really don't understand people who say that this game is crap...Ok i understand it's a copy of counter-strike 1.6
But is that the reason to hate on this game?
I think this game is a good solution for not cracking 1.6

and there are server's/rooms where you and you friend can play alone

and has the old classic game engine from 10 year's

I played GTA V for 60 hour's now and i played this for almost 100 hours

Please don't hate on this game just of reasons like Copy,Crap Engine,Over priced(Don't know who said that)
This game is awsome and i would recommend this game

Dear developer's
-Thank you"
9592,REALLY GOOD AND INTERESTING GAME!!

9596,hey its free come on. even though they used the original counter strike engine. its still a really fun game. And it works great with older computers
9597,its really good game for low end pc's
9598,"It wasn't THAT bad, just pretty awful. Hopefully, the exit button worked perfectly."
9599,It has a soccer mod in it.
9600,make this for mac pls
9601,"got a demonic insta kill battleaxe

9602,game is shit uses hack shield for one and dosent start half the time or at all!
9603,sick
9604,great and funny
9605,Very fun to play however the rounds are short.
9606,Dont install.
9607,"fun game
"
9608,its the best zombie survival ever
9609,This game gave me fucking cancer
9610,bad
9611,plz make it like CS:GO but with zombies thx and plz more weps!
9612,"hi
"
9613,I do not like this game because it is too complicated for me i dont not recomend downloading it
9614,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."
9615,It sucks... 10/10 you need friends who will over load your game to have actual fun not random shitty player who are noobs and just tell you to follow that person into a bottomless pit and die. (thats what noobs are btw thres no bottomless pits in the game) gamplay is shitty and the graphics... OH THE GRAPHICS IS A LIE! NOTHING SEEMS LIKE WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. the fact that you dont sprint in this game and the zombies can makes it unfair and people just camp in one spot and no one ever get to people fast enough because the hidious knock back knocks you back everytime you get hit and you get slowed down and its soo not fun tring to get out of the bullets. and how do you uninstall games pls tell me that i have 2 shitty games (1 of them is this) the quit button works very well so 1/10 DONT GET YOUR HOPES HIGH COUNTER STRIKE!
9616,"I don't see what all the hate is about. This game is the future. With its amazing story and hyper realistic graphics Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies is the the game of the next decade.






If you believe this you're beyond stupid."
9617,COOL GAME :)
9618,it made me poo
9619,well so lets talk about (CSNZ) so its a peace of s### to top it off with its terrible zombie mode wich this game is supoosed to be about is well basically how to put it s### and its terrible servers that usally have over like 7000 ping i did not enjoy this game in my view if i were you i would just buy THE REAL counter strike and not some lame s### remake of the first one to make you buy some dumm community made weapons its crap you know what know its s### i had a terrible time my freind hates this game after playing over 17 hours of this game i get it so well please if i were you id ask your mom to putt some funds on your account so you can buy the real game in my view if you like this game just ######################################################## you so yep thats it.
9620,I hate this engine so much.
9621,love this game
9622,fun to kill time
9623,"CS 1.8 meets COD infection mode. Pretty fun. I LOVE the weapons the devs added like the M1887, AK-47 with a GIANT banana magand scope, and some demonic looking versions of actual weapons like the M60E4 and he MP5. the Zombies are similar to TF2 classes because they are unique from each other and have helpful abilities. there are also other game modes that are quite interesting and even normal game modes like TDM. Recomended for the bored and those who like CS and zombies"
9624,"I dont know how people play this game mainly because you can't kill a zombie unless you have three or more people shooting it non stop. The Zombies have way too much health, the graphics are super outdated, and its just bad. If your expecting something like CS:GO with zombies then don't bother installing its a waste of time."
9625,"If you like autism, you will like this game. 9/11"
9626,It's not good and I uninstalled it.
9627,I took more time writing this review then I did enjoying the game.
9628,Awesome :3
9629,"It isn't so bad. Pretty cool if you like shootin' zombies and CS. Gather new weapons and items, lvl up and some other stuffs. Play, for free, CS and zombies for free. No more to say."
9630,needs better graphics
9631,"Well, it's free to play 1.6 and Zombies :) I think it's pretty good even with some new weapons"
9632,Would terminate connection to server again.
9633,Fuck you aND YOUR SHIT FUCKING GAME.
9634,"I used to play Counter Strike : Online (wich is pretty much this game only a tiny bit different). Everyone is complaining about this game but I enjoy this game everytime I play it. The fact that it looks old doesn't bother me, neither do little things such as the bots endlessly spamming the mic. I just enjoy this game as something I can always play when I feel like it. I mean it's free to play after all. And if I have to complain about something, it's the complicated weapon enhancement system if you wanna try to craft a +6 or +8 weapon wich will change the weapons colour. Shortly put, this is a game for everyone who just feels like playing counter strike in a different and less serious way, or who wants to go through the nostalgia of playing the old Cs maps. And if you like zombies and have some friends who would be willing to try this game with you, you can enjoy Zombie Shelter mode together."
9635,garbage
9636,Better than any actual football game but for real it is a good game and it has a lot of game modes
9637,Great Game..Love it!!
9638,this is the best counter stike game i have ever played in my life i highly would reccomend playing this nice work nexon .PEACE
9639,worst game of the i nthe past 5 centuries. a hoop and a stick is more fun than this.  playing basketball with a 50 pound boulder is more fun than this.
9640,#1 press play this game requires steam simulater 2015 going to forever.
9641,"The best thing about this game was shooting the rectangular chickens with no dieing animation



This game is awful
Its Valves Source Engine gone wrong
The graphics are at Play Station 1 level (Thats not good)

Theres one thing good about it... Its FTP... So people don't have to waste there precious earnings on this piece of crap!


But wait! Its PTW so people can waste there precious earnings on this pile of crap"
9642,Thanks
9643,It's a good game
9644,Great game!!
9645,cstrike-online.exe has stopped working
9646,"Clicked play stood there clicked again and it said game app already running -_- 1000/1000 would uninstall it over and over
"
9647,Same game like Counter-Strike 1.6 just escaping from zombie
9648,"I remember when this game was good , now it's a total p2w"
9649,"do u like 90's graphics and flippin' dipster lookin' zombies with more health than bottles a mountain dew you drank during your last game of REAL counter-strike? And also a disgusting excuse for a counter-strike game in general? Than this is the game for you! But not for me becuase I do not like that smack. my no-kia phone has better graphics and is more exciting than this game. It's not even worth the $0.00. This game almost gave me brain cancer but luckily I did the smart thing to do and returned my pc back to costco and will shoot myself in the head later :). If you dont want to resort to suicide I suggest you never ever get this game or watch any videos on it. Please. Don't be a wanker, save the manatees. :)"
9650,"cinda like it so im not picking 
"
9651,"These trailers make most companies presentations at E3 look truthful.

Expectation:
Large detailed maps.
Epic battles between survivors and the ravenous horde.
Varied content.
Lots of player customization with weapons and costumes.

Reality:
Every map I played was ""run from point A to point B"". Thanks to this, i now understand ""rush B, silver style"".
The only people i ever saw shoot were the ones who just started the game.
(see complaint #1.) At least there isn't anything interesting to distract you as you run.
Any item you find or buy is only usable for a limited time, after which it dissapears into subspace.

Conclusion:
I would say there is only one way to quit the game, but the gun you had just dissapeared."
9652,"i mean it is a fun game and all but the start up button is not working that well, at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
and it is geting me extremely pissed of!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
9653,Dis Game Be Dank you.
9654,this game gave me aids and cancer combined
9655,The best hentai skins into CS 1.6
9656,the game is one of the best zombie games made if u wanna play it i strongly suggest the u download this game
9657,"In Scout`s voice, ""This sucks!"""
9658,"Allow me to enlighten you on my life changing experience of this game.
I launched the game. Well I say the game launched in fact a jpg of some zombies filled half my screen then some daily rewards thing flashed up in and then I opened the options menu to try get it into fullscreen.
There. Is. No. Fullscreen. I clicked widescreen, reset the resolution and nothing happened.
I then decided to give and and play with the game only filling half my screen. After clicking quick game the game promptly began to crash. This happened repeatedly after my futile attempts to actually play this trainwreck of a game.
Speaking of trainwreck, being in a traincrash would be exactly 6.43 billion times more enjoyable than this game. I've had more fun being mauled by a bear"
9659,"That was a reaaaally bad experience.... The reviews here are not wrong, trust them!"
9660,fun
9661,"Ive only played 4 minutes of this game and i already shit myself twice. I dont know if it was the chimichanga i had for lunch or if it was the games epic menu, but still I shat my pants. This game has all of the features you want in any game and then removes them all right at the start...casue you know...communism. This game plays better than a when I took a CDR disk and pissed on it and put it in my computer. This game is revolutionary and is so freaking amazing that i recomend it to anybody who uses a brick to play games on steam. 10/10 would purposely blue screen to quit agian."
9662,Wow.  How could a CS game be so bad?!  Deleted forever.
9663,This is a Vey GOOD GAME
9664,just a shitty cs source but free
9665,"The Counterstrike serius is a vary populer game serius. But they where missing somthing Zombies so one day a korean gamer decided to make counter stirke nexon.. This game would feacture many things like... Different guns , zombies coustom maps ,a story and is free. This game features different guns..From Shotguns that shoot fire to Double malee fists. These weapons are at most cataglorys (shot gun , Light matchine gun , Melee , submatchine guns and Assult rifle) These guns are good for killing humans and zombies in the all new zombies mode.. You can choose if you want to be a zombie or kill the zombie.Not only that But there are alot of gamemodes for zombies so it will take a while to get board of it.. More maps= more adventureing! Are you a story fan? your in luck there is a story mode for zombies lets see how long you can solve it!"
9666,This is fucking atrocious. AVOID!
9667,it's ok now
9668,"The only thing good about this game is The Zombie Shelter game mode. Even that isnt that good. 


Cons:
Zombie modes are same as any other CS 1.6 zombie server. Even worse than those with all those paid or craft weapons. 
Zombie Scenario is just about buying M249 and spraying bullets.
Shitty nearly anime characters and weapons

Pros:
Zombie Shelter mode
If you're going to buy CS:GO you can practice on some noob players

Overall 3/10
"
9669,Kinda fun.. kinda old though! Id prefer it to be a mod of cs:go
9670,"Gave me a headache within minutes.

migraine/10"
9671,"This Counter Strike is for poor people
If you want to play counter strike don't play this
You can be killed by a premium player with golden weapons
You can kill a player and be killed
You can waste your money on skins and weapons
If you love your life don't play this ""game"" trust me"
9672,"I grew up on 1.6. 

this is pure garbage. I don't understand how Valve could let something like this happen. Why the fuck did it need 2 gigs of data? Valve, you should be ashamed you let such a great game go down the shitter like this.

Graphics-
16 years old. Some of the character and gun designs are okay. The zombies themselves are somewhat creative. There's one with a coffin with what seems to be an arm hanging out, grasping at the air. The zombie can hrow the coffin as a projectile. Pretty original. Overall, the graphics are just dated. But the same can be said about CS 1.6. However, there is little to none originality in this game in the way of graphics. Most of the guns, maps, and skins were taken directly from CS. Of course, you can always grind for some of the lame steampunk looking guns and skins, but that would be a massive waste of time you could spend playing much better games.

Sounds-
The annoucers are just fucking awful. It's annoying, muffled, and overall just very amateurish. Most of the sounds are also directly from 1.6. Shocker, I know. Any sounds or voices that aren't directly copied are suprisingly worse. The zombies all sound like shit. The music sets the bar for being absolutely mediocre. Elevator music is less generic.

Community-
You'll find three kinds of people in this game. 
1.) Kids that take the game very seriously, have most guns unlocked, skins up the ass, and will defend the game until the end of time.
2.) Foreigners.
3.) People that recognize the game for the trash it is and quickly uninstall.

Gameplay-
This is what matters most in any game: Is it actually fun?

Sorta. 

If you grew up on 1.6 as I did, and fondly remember the zombie servers, you could find some nostalgic bliss if you can work your way past the awful bullshit. However, the game is just bad. So many things prevented me from liking this game. At the core, it could be fun. It has the potential. But it's not ever going to get there. Everything that made 1.6 zombie servers great is completely non-existent here. 



Final Judgement-
I give the game 2/10 for an easy uninstallation and reminded me to go play 1.6 after 6 years.  Also, you can't fucking curse. So goddamn stupid."
9673,MINDLESS BORING GAME
9674,aaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
9675,Well im a FPS Gamer ! from 2011 im playing this GAME. Actually not this & other regions like CSO Taiwan/Hongkong Singapore/Malaysia. Since this game stared on 2014 September i joined the game. its really good to see that there still Counter Strike Lovers left. Graphics are good ! game free but in game items need purchase. Decoder systems are not bad at all. from my view ill give 7/10. If you love counter strike then join this Online version. The Best ever CSO.
9676,"If you like classic Counter strike and you like zombies, than you will LOVE this game. I personally play counter strike and I say it's a great steal FOR FREE! And, better yet, you don't really haev to buy anything in-game adn if you do, then it is really cheep. 

8/10"
9677,"tbh this is a pretty bad game i mean the graphics arnt all that great considering the game is from 2014 and the zombies are really op they have like 10k+ health and 1 shot, on the other hand when the survivors shoot a zombie they get pushed back if you are getting shot by like 3 people you cant even move compared to killing floor this is a awful game i dont recomend playing this"

‚úñ Can't choose region - ping is garbage - unplayable *Also as i have seen - it is not only me*
Probably thier servers are stored in africa so everyone has tons of ping
‚úñ There are p2w weapons like Cyclone that if you get hit by it you just freeze and can't move"
9700,"why the hell does it keep saying ""you need steam to run this game"" where the fuck else am i going to get it? tacobell?"
9701,"I'm seeing a lot of negativity for this game and there really shouldn't be. I've had a blast playing this game so far and all these 5 hours have been in one session. I DO NOT OWN ANY OTHER COUNTERSTRIKES, so that may be my deciding factor on this game.

Pros: Game is fun and community is nice to play with
there isnt too much competitive play in the zombie modes from what I've seen, but then again, i still dont know how to navigate very well :)
You can jump into literally any game on the list with the click of a button and it's not too hard to find (The little bar at the top :))
the range of weapons is immense and it is very interesting to find many many many MANY different ones with crafting. 
People have said that this game is ""Pay to Win"" But it most definitley isn't. I havent spent a dime and I've out DPS'd people who have bought there weapons.
The ranking system in the normal Modes is INCREDIBLY well done. For some reason... You look at League ranking system or CS:GO (From what ive heard) and people are in divisions they definiley shouldnt be in. But here, everyone is the same skill level at their own divisions. Except for MAYBE the one person who is better than most because theyve played countersrike before (Only happened about 1-3 times out of 20)
their Hack prevention must be A++ because i havent seen a hacker yet (I was kind of expecting to)


Cons: The game gets quite laggy at times as the servers are hosted by individuals and connects through them. 
The game tend to crash forme sometimes, I'm not sure if this is a global thing, but it is kind of annoying.
Specific weapons are TOO strong compared to others (LMG`s work SO WELL against zombies)
I am running on an older CPU so I have slight frame issues on normal games. 
Explosions are kind of difficult to see. (E.G you walk towards something that is explodING and you die because you cant see it)



Gameplay: I`d rate it about an 8/10.
The gameplay may be better if maybe there was a way to move a little faster (Sprint Such and such)
otherwise i like the gameplay, shooting is fun and switching weapons makes an addicting noise (I DONT KNOW WHY)

I would reccomend this game, But NOT to CS:GO fans. If you are playing CS:GO, STAY THERE! IM WARNING YOU NOW.

total Rating 8.5/10 :D Happy game hunting!

9702,U SUCK BUTY
9703,"The only good part about it is the zombie coop mode, you and other players collect materials(Iron,Wood) and make a base to protect yourself from the zombies, then on  like round 15  the boss spawns and pwns you and everybody. After you died 20 times you finally kill him and thats it. Other modes are pure bullshit."
9704,"Why buy counter strike when you can get free counter strike!!!

no seriously, it's a fuckin port of counter strike source, WITH ZOMBIES.

so get it.

now"
9705,
9706,This game is absoultly the worst Counter-Strike game of all time.
9707,WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU EVEN CONSIDER THIS SHITTY GAME?!
9708,Aham.
9709,Otimo jogo!
9710,"Okay, Where do I begin. Zombie scenario survival is now made too easy due to an event.
The dragon sword is a good item to use for me, I enjoy it and yes i have to be on every day to keep its life at 15. Ofcourse I can skip 2 days go back and and its back at 15. But, Insta-killing the zombies...
Slight issue. I wanted difficulty. Not a fucking deadly butter knife. Seriously. The only time i want that is when morons make me wants to slit my own damn throat by saying something utterly stupid.
For example ""How do you shoot?"" Thats when i want something like that.
Not when i see tons of zombies. Also Apperantly I can keep some items forever because I have multiple of the same gun I had atleast 30 M3's, one was permanent 29 of them were not, turned into item extention coupons. Seriously? Its good but. Do i really need 29 of the same fucking gun!? Make a wheel system or something and give someone a temp item. Very simple. No need to load my machine gun menu with M3's.
But hey there are some pros. Like randomly having 106 100% health kits when you have no fucking clue how you got them.....thanks...i guess? Im not really sure thats a good thing when im cutting through zombies with an overpowered fucking item. But hey thats cool! I said something stupid, Time to slit these zombies throats!"
9711,Honestly this game is really fun it has meny fetures to it like survival ffa and much more give this game a chance at least and you will have fun so i hope yall try it out!

It Has crappy graphics.

It has stupid animations.

It dosen't feature higher resolution then 10.

It Wont let you log in sometimes..

The Uninstall button works.

Bots Play with you.

Bots are useless.

Importantly:It takes away 2 gb of your disk.

Why not save for Dizzel rather then this?

"
9717,"I think this game is pretty fun and that it deserves a try, and yes i indeed do know that i havent played this game alot. But this game is a f2p version of cs 1.6 the start of the counter strike franchise. This game is less serious then cs:go and it doesnt look that good compare to cs:go or noob of duty, but it gives me and some other cs 1.6 fans the nostalgia of playing. I honestly think all cs:go player that never played cs 1.6 to try the game if they have it. But if not then they need to download this game."
9718,"The reason I play this is because you can pretty much play old Counter-Strike for free but with new weapons. I think the zombie modes usually suck, though. Sometimes might feel pay-to-win. Really I just like the counter strike part. Overall 7/10."

Pros:
Solid online Gameplay
Many Modes
Balanced Guns
Wide range of PC Spec Support

Cons:
The Menu is laggy on low end PCs (Which they should fix)
Some of the stuff don't link to the original
It sometimes feel like I am playing Combat Arms on some modes."

9749,"Pay to win.  The moment you get on, it's flashing all kinds of gimmics to suck you dry.  Only way to win is to have your mom's credit card."
9750,"The game took an unreasonable amount of time to start up, and I wasn't even sure it was at first until I checked my Task Manager. After finally getting in, the first game I joined had things going smoothly at first. It was against bots, and I was able to decently get kills. The movement was floaty and awkward, but it's a small free game, I didn't expect too much. Then when the room got about 8 people or so, lag and stuttering set in. I kept dying when trying to simply aim at bots standing still because my reticle would jump around all over the place. I left that game and decided to find a new one, this one ended up being a zombie match. After the first round, someone left the game as the second was starting, and then I heard a repreated loop of ""Seven"" until the game froze and ultimately froze my entire computer. My computer is quite old and I try to stay away from anything that could harm it like this out of fear of it breaking. That said, I've played more demanding games than this, and this one should've never crashed my entire computer, and it wasn't even a freak accident but the second game I played ever. I could go play free online FPS Unity games games and have less worry than this."

I want to play this game, I want to experience it, I am hoping Dust/Dust 2 will be zombifyed.

Right now, the game won't even launch. Everytime I load it up, it says: ""This game is already running."". You also can't close the task, because access is denyed.

Not sure if a virus, but if it's a real game: just make it work so I can play it and delete this review and give a proper one.

/r/PCMasterRace & /r/Gaming: ""Don't be this guy"" has been a post on both of your subs many times. Well guess what: this is how you get them to actually read your support tickets.

9810,"This game is amazing. I have been playing sence it came out. They keep updating it, adding more weapons, game types, maps and maps. They also make it easier for people to get good weapons without paying. However i will admit that people that have money do get an advantage. HOWEVER the game is free to play so how else do you exspect the creators to get cash. Also the creators could make you pay to play the game in the first place. 
Besides being free and up to date the gameplay is fun and with all the modes they have there is something for everyone (who like a first person shooter). That includes singleplayer because evem though there is no singleplayer mode you can put a password on a bot match."

9812,"It's not a awesome game, don't get me wrong, but it really builds a teamwork ambiance, and it's pretty entertaining, so, if you have no money on steam wallet and don't wanna spend money in games, play this a few hours, and you will get into the infinite models, HATS, and nonstop co-op action gameplay. Plus, you can play the old school mod to half-life: Counter Strike 1.6 ( the first one )

Its base off a super old engine where you can't even aim the guns(wut?).

9867,"2015-June 26 Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies Review. This was an awkward game for me to play, I did not understand the start menus, so I cannot really explain about all the things you are supposed to be able to purchase in game. I think I might have been earning points like XP or something.  I did not really know..

The first few matches went by without me getting into the actual gameplay, because I was stuck in the menu wondering what I was supposed to do..  I couldn't find my way into the game...

Once in the game, I could not see, the whole game area was too dark, but I was not going to alter my graphics for this one game, since everything is set perfectly for all the other games I play. If it were worth my time and if I had enjoyed the game, I would have pushed the boat out..

Gameplay is fast but no skill is particularly required to shoot and kill others, I did not mind that, but it was also repetitive.  There was no taking-cover aspect in the game, where it seems that you are pitted primarily against the other team AND a zombie independent threat.

You are either a terrorist (team 1 - dressed like a rebel) or a counter-terrorist (team 2 dressed like a soldier), - but I did not see any gameplay where I was -   one-on-one with the other team.  Its confusing - I know, until I explain that the other third team are the zombies. (Team 3).

I always - only saw zombies - or my own team mates none of the other team. That's one of the reasons why I'm confused..   

A zombie boss type monster (I think) who is perhaps an AI attacked me and I turned into a werewolf like zombie, with werewolf-like claws.  I didn't get it at all. What am I a werewolf or a zombie.. ??

Next, if you are a zombie creature you attack the remaining teams and try to infect them. I got shot every time and don't think I managed to get close enough to turn anyone into a zombie. That's where it is too easy to kill approaching persons with your gun.

Other players who were obviously hooked on the whole idea of the game and understood what they were doing, were much more skilled than I was, I don't think I could stick to playing this game, as I found it pointless. But then again, I was constantly on the wrong end of the bullets or got attacked from above or behind by zombies.

I didn't stand a chance..

Now just to tell you my qualification for being able to comment objectively. I play COD and BF and am usually in the top three, if not at the top all the time. So I know what I'm doing and I enjoy these types of game usually. I have a lot of experience with FPS games.

I also like to play horror survival games - like Silent Hill and Undead Nightmare (RDR). Basically, I'm saying, I know what's good and bad in games like this and I did not like this game. If you are into the same kinds of games I am into. You probably won't like this game either..

Confused and disappointed. I don't know what I expected to find. But I do expect the menus in any game to be much easier..  

My advice would be to try this game for yourself, then you will know if my appraisal (or lack of it), is any good. If you think my review is accurate, you can then perhaps read my other reviews I write that I put a lot of care and thought into."
9868,"It's a good game as long as you don't play on public servers, where people have overpowered weapons where it's just unfair.

I prefer to play on server with just my friends, we just about always play the game together.
We put a password and we just have fun, we play strategically or just simply do stupid stuff.

I suggest you play on a server with 3+ friends and 0 strangers.

So unless you can't get any friends to play this with, then I suggest you play a different game."
9869,"This game should've used better graphics, even for a F2P game it's sad."

9912,Awesome game
9913,Very very very good game.Its perfect.
9914,"yeah i guess its okay, well yeah its good i like it you dont need a super computer or anything it runs really well on every thing i know my computer is really bad and runs things laggy and badly but in this case very nice, oh and not just the graphics run really well but ive played counter strike for a very long time now and here is ZOMBIES! 10/10 i like it."
9915,the graphics for this game are so god dam bad every time i joined the game i threw up all over my computer if u want this game is free and it still isnt worth downloading if u wanna get counter strike then get counter strike global offensive it is worth the pay it has good graphics EPIC maps awesome dlc good graphics and different and cooler types of default guns and if u want zombies well get dayz or left 4 dead or something those are also worth the pay
9916,"terrible game, p2w"
9917,"I have played many CS games before, but I mainly played CS:S and CS:GO. And this game is nothing like CS. If you think CS:GO is nothing like CS, just look at this.

Graphics:
The graphics are borrowed from a game from 1999. Graphics in a game don't matter, but it does help if you do manage to UPDATE THEM? There is no excuse to use graphics from 1999, considering this is a game from 2014, but at least the graphics are bearable.
Grade: D-

Animations:
The animations are borrowed from CS 1.6, which would be fine, but this is a tense, action packed game. The slow reload animations meant for a tactical, slow-paced FPS doesn't fit in the game. Sometimes, the animations don't even work, and I'll think the gun broke, only to realize it just didn't display and manage to waste a round into a wall. The death animations for the zombies don't make sense. Most of them are just kneeling to the ground, rising, and falling again. I'm not a master in physics, but I'm pretty sure getting shot by an AWP, a .308 winchester rifle, would at least throw back the zombies instead of forcing them to kneel. CS 1.6 managed to make different animations for getting killed in different place (shot in stomach, shot in head, shot in back etc.) and THAT was made in 1999, so why not this?
Grade: F-

Gameplay:
Terrible. This is nothing like CS. This is fast-paced and action packed, unlike CS' slow-paced, tactical action. The weapons feel too powerful, as even a gun weak like the Glock 17 can kill a zombie in 1 or 2 hits. The start screen is pretty, but user-UNfriendly. I accidently joined a game trying to join a normal game. There are way too many zombies in the co-op game heading at you, and even though I set my gun as the AUG, I still get the machine gun that empties in 5 seconds. Despite it being action-packed, I often got very bored.
Grade: F--

Sound:
Can't really judge this, as the game borrowed many, many sounds from CS 1.6, but the music is very loud. I often couldn't  hear anything when music played.
Grade: F

Verdict:

The game is a clusterfuck of zombies coming at you, with loud music and animations that don't help the game. It doesn't deserve to have ""Counter Strike"" in the title. Fans of counter strike, this is not your game. I suggest any CS game but this.
Grade: F-"
9918,its good
9919,AMAZING btw if u saw me on a server i am SLENDERLIO
9920,Good Game :D
9921,"1. Why the Polish language that was in the game was removed?

2. Why game saves have been removed?

Now I start the game again with 1 level and English language.

It's a shame because the game was fun, do something with it and I will change the review.

9922,dont waste your time

9926,"BEST GAME EVER MY NIGKAS LOVE ALL THAT DECODER SHIT WE GOT VERY MUCH GUNS SO CAN KILLED ALL THE FUCKINJ HOOD BLACK NIKKGAS THINKED THAT THEY ALL KONNA DIE LIKE FLIES BUT THEY SURVIVED EVEN MY PLASMA GUN, THIS PLASMA SHIT IS BETTER THAN MY NERF MINIGUN LOL HASFTTAG MOM MAKING POTATOS"
9927,"its an alright game, could improve on graphics, could add more snipers, could make it easier to get achivments"
9928,This game's menu is too complex and I couldn't even find where to play a real game: I basically got stuck in the menu and uninstalled it not bothering to figure out how everything works. This game is simply too complicated to begin with.
9929,"I've been playing this game on and off since 2015 and I can say while it is fun to play and looks great despite it running on Counter-strike 1.6's version of goldsrc's engine.  I just cant recommend it due to gameplay pretty much revolving around decoders which are pretty much this game's version of p2w lootboxes, basically you buy decoders to get new weapons or characters to keep permanently or for a limited time weather it be for 5 days up to a year. decoder's prices are really expensive too like they came out of a damn mobile game.

The new weapon enhancement system is complete trash. old enhancement system was so much better. if something happens to your weapons during enhancement your pretty much screwed, permanent weapons are also sometimes consumed and used as enhancement material which makes enhancement material you get from the store basically pointless and thus you have to fork over more of your $$$ to buy more decoders just to try to get your weapon again, while there is a player auction its barely ever open and even if it is the prices for other player's weapons cost so much mileage to buy, you're better of fishing through decoders to get your desired weapon.

Nexon and its staff are useless and don't really help much at all with people's issues either.

P2W stuff aside. as I said yes this game is enjoyable if your looking for something new and similar to CS 1.6 and l4d2. there are many modes to choose from but most people play either Zombie hero, Zombie Scenario, Original Bomb/Defuse or Deathmatch. so if you wanna play another mode like zombie giant you gotta host a room yourself and hope people join."
9930,420/69 Weed kush would play again.
9931,da fuq is this shit
9932,"Great game, great modes, mechanics are good for a free game and visuals are workable (at best). Has something for everyone, with all the common zombie modes as well as non zombie such as deathmatch and team deathmatch. Overall very enjoyable and worth playing."
9933,Good
9934,"its lost its identity. used to be called Nexon Zombies.

nexon studio sounds pretty lame in comparsion."
9935,I really like this game! Mix of Counter Strike and Left4Dead. LOVE IT!
9936,why am i banned i haven't cheated
9937,Not good.Ne preporucujem ovu igru.
9938,"well, played this game in the asian version 3 years ago, and u have no idea how much money i spend on using decoders, but rly it was pretty much the funniest game iv ever played, ohh btw i main zombie hero, favorite map italy, when u have played the game for a certain time, u get rly use to zombies chasing you, so dont worry if u always get caught for the first few times, believe me u will get better, like me, now i basicly dominate the game, by only using a basic shot gun and a nata knife, its all about dem skills, u shoot, hold them back, let your teammates shoot alittle and go to the back of the zombies and shank them, trust me, if u get the trick, u will think this is the best zombie game ever, the joy when u headshot or knifed a zombie to death, ohh god the orgasms. recomand 10/10"
9939,"If you are looking for a good game, please, for the love of God, do not click on this game. It is very one-sided, and to go along with that, the servers are very laggy.

For a few frantic hours they search for him. When he is found he and his backpack are soaking wet. The boy refuses to tell the mother where he has been and why he is wet. The mother is understandably angry and takes the boy home. As soon as they enter their home, the boy rushes up the stairs and locks himself in the bathroom. After jimmying the lock, mom finds the boy sitting in the bathtub, fully clothed...with a penguin. Little clever boy that he was managed to get into the penguin tank while he was missing...and stuffed a living penguin into his backpack."

Please game developers. learn how to make a game that isnt 95% ripping off another.
10020,keeps on crashing and closing the game because it thinks i am hacking (hack sensor thingy)
10021,"BEST GAME EVER!!!!
"
10022,"So i read the reviews and saw all the negativity regarding it, and i thought: why not put in a review of my own, to try and balance thing a little.
Yes, i know it's basically CS 1.6 with foggy maps and zombie mods( zombie mod servers were my favourite) and Nexon just threw some stuff and mixed it with some CS:GO, like ranking and crafting(which is kinda annoying when you try to craft some good weapons - because it fails miserablly) and i know the size of this game is greater than a fully customized CS you can find on the interwebz, but i don't think it's that bad. I mean yeah, i'm not too thrilled it's the same old CS, and honestly, Nexon could've done better than take some old mods and maps, slap some fancy new names on them and calling them new, but if you just want to relax and play some old CS, and you haven't bought GO yet and want to make an image of how the ranking system is, then this game could do the trick."
10023,"I did 10 daily mission and i've only received 4 decoders which completely pisses me off

10025,"I cant really say it was bad or good but it does have problems like when your a zombie bullets stop every zombie so you 
can't get close to them. And one the map that I could get on humans just camped there and just all the zombies all and the starting weapons are a joke, to some zombies you can not kill them with the starting weapons the only way zombies can get people is if they get to camping spott and hit somes one which is like 100,000X harder than it sounds i wish the zombies were npcs or I wish that zombies had a fair chance so humans could camp or something but hay its in beta so maybe vavle will change it (I HOPE) p.s. its all so confusing so its ok i guess"

10/10 Would uninstall again"
10034,Counter Strike 1.6 Zombie Mod. So creative !
10035,This is actually a bit of fun.
10036,I didn't installed this game.It's a crap !
10037,"Great, i play it with my friends, it is a Great Game. I Totally rcomend it for anybody to play! :D"
10038,"Worst game ever.

From buy2win to retarded gamemodes.

Worst game in the CS series."
10039,"Its counter-strike 1.6 with some new mods, new weapons, new character skins,etc.
i rate this game [strike] 7/10 [/strike] because they push out update's slowly and sometimes it's just only 2 new weps

[h1] Do i recommend this game?	[/h1]

[strike] Yes + its free to play so you cant lose money but i only recommend it who doesn't dislike's a game from it's graphics. [/strike]

Edit: They made the game full p2w rip 4/10"
10040,Very fun game definitely deserves more players. Lots of good stuff giveaway for free like decoders.
10041,"Don't know why there are so many haters, but I actually enjoyed this game."
10042,vary fun but needs a little bit more even teams like if everybody on your team leaves but you it will saty that way unless someone join which never happens
10043,"It's a very great game!
"
10044,Exit and uninstall works.
10045,"I swear I only play like the turn everyone into zombies or escape mode or soccer. This is the best freaking and only soccer game I will play.

Came for zombies, now for soccer. 

7/10 Would kill for a soccer ball."
10046,No severs for people in Aus and so much p2w
10047,I've only played this once and regretted every life decision that led me to this point.
10048,jo men visst :)
10049,"I like the game and all but now for some reason it says ""Can not connect to the server"" its been like that for months now please fix"
10050,awesome  :D
10051,I think this game is a really cool twist on the normal counter-strikes. I really like the idea of crafting weapons. I recommend this game 100%
10052,you can play this if you dont have cs:go
10053,Dont waste your time with this
10054,"tbh, nexon zombies is a great game, for what its worth(free). though some poeple may not like this game.Im pretty sure that beacause this game is a bit hard to learn in the beginning, but once you get to know the game, its actually pretty fun and addicting.Though mostly, this game contains alot of stoners, and chinks, but that becuase nexon zombies is a direct copy of cso( basaically nexon, but in asia). so nexon zombies was an attempt to bring cso, to the west, but its not so hot here, obv.

Nevertheless, i enjoy this game, its a good game to pass the time, and plus its 1.6 free!
10/10 haters gonna dislike, im gonna preach


ps:ive spent $80+ on this game.."
10055,them graphics dou
10056,"I'm not talking about the micro-transactions.
I'm talking about the game. It is CRAP.
It released in Korea first, then China..., and now is on steam.
So, you are playing a game that HAS BEEN already crappy enough.
And now, you are available to enjoy it in a much crappier way!"
10057,Just too much lag and Too boring
10058,it is a very good game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVEE iTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!
10059,"This game is for Gingers.   Would dye my hair again.   10/10
"
10060,"made by the same people who made Combat Arms, many micro-transactions. Do not recommend"
10061,bun
10062,"amazing game love it neeed to preserve this game and the CS franchise for the next 20 generations
"
10063,i hate it
10064,"Rather complex, but fun game. Brings back memories from the ealry CS Series'. Great game!"
10065,Horrible.
10066,legit
10067,It's alright for when you have little budget or if cs 1.6 zombie servers are dead.
10068,Really Good Game Espicially For Who Cant But The Normal Counter Strike (y)
10069,Very Cool game i liked it!
10070,"This links it all together. Left For Dead and Counterstrike are in the same universe. It might sound crazy and nearly impossible but ive found enough evidence for this to be true. In CS.GO there are about two or three maps in the game that almost look just like some maps from LFD 1-2 . Now most people will say its just reskined because it would me easy for Valve to do that, thats what i thought. Intill this game this is the game that links it all together. it makes sense there was a pandemic and now all the armys are trying to take out the zombie virus. And a nother thing is that a lot of zombies in the game look identicle to zombies in LFD 1-2 thats just my thought."
10071,"I have noticed some people rating this game positively because the ""Exit Game"" button works. I am here to confirm that it does not."
10072,Played this game once. I recommend not dowloading and playing this because of the fact that you don't see any zombies. Glitches may be involved in this as well.
10073,it is really fun once u get past the graphics
10074,Better than 1.6
10075,Good game :D
10076,Do you guys have any idea how popular this game in Asia.especially china.
10077,"it helps u practice cs before u get another Counter Strike game
"
10078,"This is a great F2P version of Counter-Strike if you don't want to pay for it. It is play-to-win, though, so beware. You can still have a fun time even with the pay-to-win aspect. There are game modes that are not present in 1.6. Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is basically Counter-Strike Online, but released in America."
10079,"I remember one day I ate a lot of food, a mix of junk food really. It was nearing nighttime and I felt this aching pain originating from my tummy. As time passed on it became worse. The night was sleepless as I lay in my bed, full of pain. Morning came and I expelled this demon child  from my body. The bathroom plagued by this wretched smell. The experience was one of the worst I've dealt with in my life. However, it doesn't come as close to playing this shit game."
10080,">boot up game
>tutorial sounds good
>boot up tutorial

I get every time : ""It is not defined!"""
10082,Nice game
10083,The game is ok but easy shot to the head pointing down
10084,"10/10

i don't understand why ppl hate this game cause in my opinion i think valve ""nexon' just give you free counter strike 1.6 with every single mod u need zombie;DM.TDM;orignal;Classic: so what u wan't more u just save 9.99$ In ur packet and you play a game with new things new maps new wepons and also new skins so i just stay it's one of the best game i ever play in my life cause i was play it on the maylsien server my ping was to high so when it's came to euw i was so happy thx alot nexon :D i hope everyone try this game ^^  Have Fun !!!"
10085,Is the best CS game ever!!!Is both free and super cool! :)
10086,Best free game besides dota to waste time and money on (and tf2)
10087,"Just play CS 1.6, Source or GO with a zombie mod. If you just want a zombie game, try L4D/L4D2, Killing Floor, etc. Not that we don't have enough zombie games already.

All I saw here was nothing more than an obvious attempt to cash in on old school CS nostalgia with microtransactions and pay2win. Also, I had a better time navigating through the user interface in Skyrim. Never thought I'd say that before.

In brief:

-free2play
-pay2win
-camp2win
-zombies are bullet absorbent SHAMWOW
-rental guns
-crafting lel
-basically modded CS 1.6 with microtransactions and nexon slapped on the title
-2GB game size for a 17 year old engine
-low population game modes
-OP wanks everywhere
-connection lost
-awkward resolution
-GUI is a complete clusterfock
-nexon

gg -420/10 would bang my head again
c'est tres mal

shame, see me after class"
10088,this sucks butt
10089,"Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is developed based on Valve‚Äôs legendary online action game, Counter-Strike (CS). Expanding one of the top first-person shooter (FPS) titles across the world, Nexon teamed up with Valve to unleash a new zombie-themed, free-to-play CS title featuring new game modes, creatures, and more."

10091,It's good! =D
10092,Awesome game!!!
10093,Very nice Counter Strike Zombie  !!! dowland !! all
10094,Perfect game for zombie lovers to play!  What makes it even better is that you can play counter-strike source for FREE!!! I give this game * * * * * stars out of 5
10095,its fun but sometimes kicks you out for no reson
10096,Great Game!
10097,"I started the game,
my ears died instantly,
but I was close to click recommend,
uninstall button works!"
10098,About as funny as jerking off with sandpaper
10099,THE BEST GAME EVER! and i has a very good teamwork so stick togeter team and if you don't stay togerter you will die and become one of the zombies.
10100,so fun crashes  crashes every game wonder what the game plays like the world may never know
10101,Bad Game.
10102,I think bleach in my mouth is better than this game...
10103,Please get the actual CounterStrike
10104,good
10105,"I thought this game was great for a free to play game. It felt like this game should have been a payed game, but it was free, so anyone could get it at any budget."
10106,"Ok. If you want a zombie survival game don't get this game. 
The zombies are barely realistic compared to other zombie games. If I am honest it reminds me of a poor anime zombie game with counter strike slipped in poorly. 

At least you can play Counter Strike 1.6 for free..."
10107,"zombie mode is bad if you cant find a camping spot, you get infected after death (which I believe is one hit,) and it would be better off just calling itself counter strike 1.6 for free."
10108, .
10109,fun
10110,good game it's liek an 1.6 but more weapons good job
10111,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
"
10112,gr8 game m8
10113,"10/10 would keep playing unless they remove decoders
"
10114,wouldn't reccomend this game to a deaf autist.
10115,jk this game sucks omg i spent the only 10 minutes on zombie mode as a zombie as you probably have to pay to not be a zombie. it's really bad like seriously really. my friend ethan said its terrible.
10116,"i got 1 problem , when i go play a server game freeze and say not responding :( Can you help me please (i only 1 time have entered server sucesful :( )"
10117,I don't even know what to say about this game
10118,"*An hour in...*
WE HAVE BEEN ENSLAVED BY THE ZOIMBIES
THE ZOMBIES WILL RETURN
*uninstall*"
10119,"Nice little Game 
Just 2 GB For SO MUCH FUN!"
10120,"good game 
"
10121,its pretty fun plus the fact of having a smooth running l4d2 like game with counterstrikes ai and ui makes it more fun <3 Nexon
10122,a horrible game to call cs
10123,Amazing.
10124,yea this game is free but when you buy cs:go or cs:s then you say this is much better game so yea if you have just steam to play free game is this good game but if you buy cs:go or cs:s or any game you most pay you will say cs:go or cs:s its much better and so you  will not play  play cs:z                                                                                                                                                                              if you like it so like it :)
10125,This game (can) be fun on certain modes and maps but it really annoys me that this uses an old engine. If this was released in early 2000's then i can understand but for me graphics isnt everything as i still play halo 1 and red alert 2 but the community is quite small and to find a good match with less than 30 ping NEVER happens but it does'nt help that it feels too much p2p so the game becomes unbearable. it CAN be good with a bunch of friends to play with and voip but without that this game is simply ftp-p2p garbage.
10126,would r8 8/8
10127,it is so shit i like it
10128,when i finish a game it stops working and i have to exit the game
10129,I love this game so please  don't hate it...
10130,"Cant play it, played for 5 hours and now the hack shield is not dentified so i now hate it!"
10131,Great game for people who love glitches and zombies. :D
10132,"It was fun, still fun if you have friends to run with. Lots of different mode but it's pay to win sadly."
10133,"This is my first 100% proper review, read it all:
Gameplay 9/10:
CSN:Z throws a lot of stuff at you when you start off but if you play around you get the hang of most of it in about 20 mins at the most, it has classic CS 1.6 gameplay and most modes are easy to get the hang of and very user friendly, for a f2p game it is almost completely impossible to call it p2w as it is supremely easy to get good guns because the default set is not a steaming pile of dog crap, I have found the G11 gold to be quite OP when put into burst fire but the other guns manage to cancel that out. The only problem here is the zombie mode's the normal pvp zombies is fun but when playing as a zombie you can look like a disabled carrot while moving as you take damage.
Graphics 6/10:
The graphics are crap but still good for a nice nostalgia trip, they used the default cs 1.6 map textures, but I cannot pinpoint the gun models, some are new (mp5) and some are 1.6 and CZ (Awp)
Content 10/10:
When you buy a game you expect a ton of content, many games don't give that but CSN:Z gives that for free. Tons of weapons/features/items and more, nuff said.
Customization 9.5/10:
Nobody buys a CS game for the purpose of customization only, but CSN:Z is a game you would expect to give customization and it does.
Settings 6.5/10:
Not high amounts of options but enough needed for a game like this.
Nostalgia 10/10:
Included in CSN:Z is CS 1.6 for free

Verdict 8.2/10:
Great job Nexon you made a f2p fps that is not p2w, you made a zombie game relatively original and a zombie game that  has the ability to do something that is not zombies and CS 1.6 for free."
10134,hmm not bad game :D but it would be awesome with trade system and drops from servers ^^
10135,I cant start it. it just says ¬¥¬¥This game requires steam¬¥¬¥      :(
10136,"would recommend had fun with mates
"
10137,"It's a great mod, and i like it!
"
10138,ehh it looks like shit and shit smells like shit but give it a try
10139,"It's a fun game to play with friends and it's a free alternative to L4D series, Dead Island or Killing Floor if you don't have the money to buy them."
10140,Solid 3.5/10
10141,haven't played global offensive so i cant really compare but its still a good game to play
10142,Just no........
10143,"I really liked the shelter mod in this game, the versus mode puts up to 4 v 4 in a shelter vs shelter match with zombies coming in each day like tower defense.  You gain skills and can help scavenge for resources, use better weapons, or build up your base.  

Probably best for a group of friends who can do at least 3v3, imo its really fun and i wish there were more games out there like it"
10144,fun game i mean really with all the modes plus if you dont like to fight zombies you can play the orginal cs
10145,For a game of 2014 no thanks.
10146,The game looks terrible and feels bad. If you like CS:GO you wont like this
10147,Good game.
10148,"I really enjoy this game. It brings me back to the CS:S days, thank you for making this."
10149,"very nice game, i like it !"
10150,Don't play this game ffs

Pros:
Awesome servers
Awesome game-modes
Awesome weapons
A lot of maps

Cons:
Some weapons do have a lot of recoil and spread as you shoot.

So far, this game is a must-play, and a must-download.

I was trying to get CS:GO, but it wasn't free and I couldn't buy it because I had $0.00 in my credit card. Instead, I got this game, CSN:Z.

And this is what I said when I played this game:

Better play CS 1.6. on zombie servers :)"
10180,Its Amazing 10/10
10181,I actually love this game. It is a great zombie game as well as the non zombie mode a pretty good too.
10182,"Its waste of time.

10190,Good game 4 Free to play. Very good game I play it witch friends.
10191,AMAZING AWESOME WORK
10192,"Okay lets clear things up right here and now.
It's not a bad game, its not a bad game at all. True it has outdated graphics, but it runs smoothly on even my crappy laptop. It's a free game guys, FREE. If you paid for it, then yeah tear it a new one. I can list hundreds of games that you pay for that are much, MUCH worse. The A.I. is really advanced as well, taking shortcuts, camping, and circling around behind you. Now about the ""Temporary Guns"". Personally I don't like it, this will probably be your along the lines of your first ""Crafted"" gun. ""Oh wow that looks frickin sick, wait I only get this for a week? That's a bunch of bull!"". Then you do the mileage thing and play bingo to get things, and its randomized. This is where it starts to decline. The menu is just confusing and all of the unlocking is frankly irritating. That all said i believe it's WELL, WELL worth it to download and play!!!"
10193,In:b4 Don't play

like its from Counter strike Source this is still agreat game i love it so i recommend this game a both"
10195,shit game
10196,Like a cs 1.6 but weapons are a bit more intersting
10197,its fun but.. can you update the zombie looks its a bit low xD
10198,"Play it not for the zombies, but because you can play oldschool CS 1.6 for free."
10199,The Fps is very low
10200,I like this game Conter-Strike Nezon Zombies Best game
10201,you know this game is not the best game i have ever played.......bu it is far from the worst game it as a nice amount of game modes and has new playable modles if your loking for like 7 to 20 games for free this is for you and one more thing this is not an mlg game if you olny mlg games than go play CS:GO
10202,Yes and no. Yes for you can play the normal vs game for free. No because the zombie aspect is really annoying.
10203,fun game of zombies
10204,"me and my friend install this got stuck with 30000000 zombies after us without ammo we died and started again--- the game have some gamemodes where you are just fucked with 2 people some gamemodes you need to destroy walls and boxes with your knife and the other need to fucking protect you from 1000000000 zombies not kidding (fun and boring at same time) / some game modes just its impossible to survive there is so much zombies and your guns are a shit ( pay to win) its fun in first¬¥s 3h /4 h i will not recomend play more is kind of stupid :|  

 4/10 i recomend but not that much
thats my review you can liked and play like more than 4 hours and there is no lag i forgot to say thats a good thing for shity pcs"
10205,"Well, it has classic bomb defusal mode. it's just 1.6 (even uses same maps, textures etc.) with microtransactions but all classic CS guns are free.
So if you want to play CS 1.6 for free, this is the way to go."
10206,I love this game but half the time the lag is so bad I can't play. There are no Australian servers. We need a server in Asia at the least.

10322,"Counter-strike Nexon:Zombies is a free-to-play (not really) game created by Nexon Europe.
This game is based in counter-strike: condition zero, but with new guns, modes, maps etc.

[h1][b]PROS:[/b][/h1]
New Guns
New Maps
New Characters.
New Modes.
4/5 Storyline (Zombie Scenario mode).
Medals/Honor System.
Familly System.

[h1][b]CONS:[/b][/h1]
P2W system.
Very confuse hub (whatever it is).
CS1.6 Graphics.
Very bugged maps.
Each updates give you more chances to empty your wallet, and if you don't have money, you don't have the best guns :)
A lot of blockers
A lot of hackers
Unbalaced Zombies
and much more...

Rating the company.. I give (8/10) to old Nexon Europe, and (2/10) to new Nexon Europe.
Rating the game.. (8.5/10).

This game is in no way an easy game at first, it takes patience and practice, however most of my complaints were gone after simply changing the way I play. Instead of rushing into battle, go slow and check around corners. Instead of getting shot and dying, stay out of sight. I've noticed that people who play this game for a short ammount of time tend to give this game a negative review however if you give the game a chance you will adapt and find youself having ALOT of fun. One of my personal favorite modes is Zombie Scenario because of it's challenging difficulty. It was fun to accept the challenge and learn how to survive dangerous encounters. Counter Strike Nexon Zombies has become one of my favorite games to play with my friends and on that note I believe that you too will enjoy it. Please remember to keep in mind that this is a free to play game and thus does not have the best graphics but graphics don't make the game, it's the content. There are many different modes to engage in and it's guarented that one of them is for you.

10345,"I never was a big fan of the user-made zombie mod included in various Counter-Strike versions, so my expectations weren't very high. 

There is not much difference between the original versions and 'Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies', so the fans will probably like this one too. It's basically the same game but with more/different weapons, different skins and there are also a few new zombies, which have different attacks. 

The developers describe this game as a 'MMOFPS', which obviously is bull****, in my opinion. If this game is a Massive Multiplayer, almost every multiplayer game would be a MMO. 
It does have the same free2play micro-transactions, though. There are lots of skins for you to buy but why would you waste your money on this game, if you can waste it on better games?

10363,"It's simply Okay.

Counter-Strike Nexon is a Counter-Strike game with Zombies. It has literally all the same assets as CS:Source, only as far as I can tell, it has worse chickens. As far as I know, there is only one map, though if there are any more, I bet you that each one, is ripped straight from one of the Counter-Strike entries.

There are many gamemodes, but in my opinion, none of them are worth playing as the game recommends you play Zombie Hero.
How Zombie Hero works is... Call of Duty Infection Mode. Literally. Only instead of people being weapon-locked, they can choose any they like and the Zombie is chosen at random. There are 10 zombie classes (Yes, Normal zombies are just zombies, they don't count because if you include Zombies in your game, you literally need them to exist) and each seem to do something different from one another via special skills. Every zombie class has the same weapons though, effectively.
You can level up your Zombie classes simply by playing. Speed is leveled up by walking around, and I'm sure others are similarily leveled, by simply doing all that is possible. Normal Zombies aren't the exception here.

Sadly... The game, like any ""good"" Counter-Strike entry, is boring. Games last too long on a single map, and each round only lasts for about 5 minutes. As usual also, every weapon is essentially the same like every military, modern-era FPS, only with specific... buffs and debuffs to certain stats.

The Counter-Strike mechanic of the absurd decrease in accuracy the longer you shoot is here. With Zombies. This could be made to work perfectly well, if the zombies didn't have 5000 health and take more than a clip of an LMG jsut for unupgraded normal zombies without dying.

But don't worry, because everytime you shoot a zombie, they are instantly kept on hold, their momentum utterly removed, no matter where they're hit from. So, so long as you can keep constant bullets on an enemy, most of them cannot move or do anything.

Maps haven't been really altered at all. Maybe the skyboxes have been removed to emulate ""night"" but honestly, it's probably because they wanted to crank this out and was lazy, even if this has been out for atleast a year and a half now... and skyboxes aren't hard to do. Just look at Starforge and Castle Miner Z.
This means any stupid, high-up places you could get to before, now are the most camped spots for humans.
Essentially maps are the equivalent of taking Assault maps in UT, and simply copy/pasting them into deathmatch. It doesn't work like that.

Going into greater detail, Matches last too long on maps not really designed for continuous play. Said maps would have actually differentiating geometry, but like nearly every map for Counter-Strike games (choose any one of them) they're linear and basic as crap corridoors, usually without roofs.

Alot of gripes with this game, I'll have with every CS title. Repetitive matches, the maps not being designed really too well, mostly all being rectangular rooms with some parts to make the shape barely different. Weapons are all the same essentially, It's visually Counter-Strike and Left For Dead if the maps and zombies looked worse.

Ultimately... it's Conuter-Strike and Left For Dead with all of the fun of Counter-Strike, just with only 80% still remaining. Fun after the first few minutes, until you realize every server is hosting only one map and maybe because the game isn't designed well enough to not hide in places you must crouch-jump to get into in order to win.

It's Free To Play, but has a system that lets you pay to progress faster. If this costed money. It would only be worth 5 dollars.

Altogether the game is fun for the first few minutes, or the first game, or the first 10 rounds, until the CS nature shows with it's repetitiveness, only with actual variations between teams and... well... zombies.

The only real silver lining is that playing as the zombies offers an actually new and fun experience. Unless you've played Left For Dead's versus mode. It's like that, only each class has skills different, and not actual differences, like mechanics differences. You will find yourself ignoring the buy menu and walking up to the zombies, or AFKing until you are turned inevitably.

Honestly the game is a 4/10. I'm already bored of it, I'm likely never to actually play it again. I'm being rather generous as after a match, your pinky finger will start to hurt. Unless you happen to offer yourself to the zombies like I did."
10364,A lot of people here are complaining about this game which I don't know why. If you can't kill zombies that's your own fault here is a video of my game play in zombie mode. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvjijkyTWXo. This game takes skills not just camping. There is a lot more to explore then just simply camping. This game deserves more players then it should. Less talking more playing! Let's go
10365,"My god... I thought I would try to play this game. It couldn't be that bad, right? I actually sorta played it to see how bad it would be. It absolutely appalls me that this game takes itself seriously. 5 minutes into the game, and I can already feel the cancer setting into my body. Every minute in the game is a minute in simulated hell. I then find out the game installs some bullsh*t software called ""HackShield."" Please, for the love of God and everything good, DO NOT install this game. NOT EVEN TO SEE HOW BAD IT IS! That was my mistake... You're probably going to do it anyway, aren't you?"

10367,its okay

10369,"Much fun, Fun mode, More zombies.
NEEDS:
-More Zombies/Aliens
-Ragdoll Death
-Playing as more zombies
-Cheats (Optional for begineers. Don't judge me.)
-Tutorial (Or else already added in game)
-More Modes.
That's what i wanted to more.

10371,Worst game I ever played! Do not install it.
10372,"ummm so ... I did spend a little time on this game , and it is a lot of fun . I see some people saying that ""you shoot for ten minutes boxes "" or "" everybody respawns not me "" so on so on ... well you know ... well you are blind or just don't understand english :))) there are a lot of modes that you can play and when you connect to one it tells you what you need to know about the gameplay of that mode ... it's not complicated you just need to read :)))
Pros 
- a lot of modes to play
- a lot of events
- a lot of weapons
- bux are fixed quite fast
- a lot of fun

Cons 
- - - - - - - - -"
10373,What went wrong.......how do you mess up a game this badly.this game physically and mentally scard me for life i dont think i can look at counterstrike the same way ever again...i feel like a bad person after playing it 11/10 best game of 2012 IGN

10377,The Best Game! I play this game every day! It is awesome!!!
10378,Had 1.6 lost my account good way to re visit the experience.
10379,"I had a better experience watching that magical uninstall button uninstall that game from my computer than i did avtually playing this crap
"
10380,i do not recomend this game the graphics are terrible and physics too its pretty laggy and boring
10381,"Here's the thing:
The game's good & such, BUT
The region's prices for items is pretty insane & different:
If you're european, you'll have to pay TWICE the price - 2 euro - for 1 weapon package.
If You're african/estonian - 1 EURO.
If you're RUSSIAN - 0.6 EURO (as in ~30 rubles)
If you are gonna be spending money on this game, then don't - This is a robbery!"
10382,this game was probs made by a decendant of hitler
10383,"It like counter-strike 1.6, and worse than Counter-strike source.  and the Iteam is expensive in the gameÔºÅ"
10384,"FUCKING AMAZING
"
10385,"Free CS 1.6+more fun than any from the other games from the series. But it has OP weapons that debalance the game and that is a bit annoying

-9/10 Good shooter to play with friends."
10386,"no Australian server do not recommend, try the awp why is my ads delay because of sever WTF."
10387,"I once crafted a flipknife. I wish that this was CS GO...
But instead of that, i got a flipknife for 3 months or so."
10388,Don't bother with this. It's basically a quick cash grab - lazy attempt at converting CS to a zombie game with many F2P elements present.
10389,Thank god this uninstalled in like 3 seconds! Not Reccommended #PixelatedAids
10390,this game had potential but they really fucked it up
10391,Pure waste of game-developing time and space on your computer. The only great feeling about this game is the 1.6 game settings feeling.
10392,"So I decided to play this game again:
1. Launching took forever
2. I was banned for hacking/cheating
3. I didn't do neither of them

Don't install this game.
"
10393,Nice game :)
10394,a badass classic with a twist
10395,"The recommendation thing to clarify, is my opinion.



This game is alright,
I mean the F2P model is actually better than most out there as you can play without paying for a permanent M60E4 as crafting can gift you something better etc and also, the crafting is much, MUCH simpler than something like TF2, even though it's guns and not hats.

The only con i could ever think of is that the moving system while your being shot at is rather dumb as you're held in place, just like a... zombie mode. I don't know if this was in the original CS games and i sure as hell know that it isn't in CS:GO.

Oh yeah, zombies. It's slapped on there after all. Really it's just CS:O reskinned and added more zombie modes to playlists etc.

Overall your experience with this game depends if you like the goldsrc engine and the version used with Condition Zero or F2P mechanics in general and the way they work etc.

I'd give this a 7.25/10

EDIT: A few hours later, a paywall so i can craft more! 7/10."
10396,"If people gave the game a chance they will see its actually not as bad as people think.

8/10

Its not paid to win, you can get items so you can get the crafting materials. The zombie modes actually have different classes, and is actually a deep system.

The extra weapons are cool. Its a good game."
10397,toolaggy not right
10398,Fucking sucks.
10399,"jeto fajn hra C:

10400,"I like the game, Voice acting is funny, and zombies have amazingly high reah >.<
All in all, I like it. Its addicting, and nothing is expected This is an amazing game :D"
10401,Lol how bad can a game be
10402,zombies with boobs 11/10
10403,Fun Game to play to pass by the time i like it
10404,"my favorite gamemodes in the cs collection.
would love to see it source quality though"
10405,Decent F2P game can be Pay to win later on but as long as you are a good player any weapon you use is good.
10406,Good game
10407,Nice game!
10408,"""Counter-Strike hit a new low with this game..."" -Luis
This game contains a lot of shit, and graphics are just like CS 1.6. It's better to find a zombie or swarm server on 1.6, then to play this piece of crap (Crap word is too good for this game)"

10413,its bad
10414,For me is good
10415,ITS A FUN ADDICTIVE GAME TRUST IF YOU TAKE THE TIME TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY AND JOIN A DECENT LOBBY OR GAME YOULL HAVE A BLAST
10416,"What a poor excuse for a game

you can have a weapon for 5 days and then you must use real money to buy the gun forever, or I can just buy a Triple A game for that price thank you."
10417,"Not as bad as everyone says it is. First off, it is not completely a p2w as you can still have powerful weapons and all without having to purchase anything. Secondly, the gameplay is actually REALLY fun in regards to how confusing it is at first. I would definately recommend this game to anyone who likes the old Zombie gamemodes from CSS."
10418,"pretty good game but the bots could be nerfed a bit
"
10419,Very fun and a lot of mini games to choose from.  It even has the original and more gamemodes.  So why waist money on counter strike source when you could get the same minigames for free with other minigames
10420,"love this game
"
10421,this game is a pile of greatness... jokes it the opposite
10422,super crappy and full of bullshit

10425,10/10 best game. game of the year 1999
10426,"You know those zombie mods on css and csgo that alot of people still play? Play those. You get beter graphics, more custom maps,  it is not pay to win, and on top you get a good game if you do not like the mode. Dont play this game. Its terrible. I still regret installing this garbage. It took twenty minutes just to get started. At least it uninstalled quickly."
10427,just no
10428,"LISTEN UP!!
IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS 8.1 IT WON'T RUN DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS GAME IT BUGS LIKE HELL ANYWAYS

"
10429,HOLY CRAP THIS IS THE BEST AND MOST FUN GAME IVE EVER PLAYED!
10430,just plain boring
10431,"Ok I am leaving my original review because the game didnt work when I bought it. But I have had some great help from Nexon PumpAction in solving the error message I got 'This game requires steam'.

This game has the older Counter Strike game modes and the new Zombie mod gameplay. Its fun its light hearted I spent the last 15 minutes blasting bot zombies apart. 

I have been on steam for a good 6 years and the amount of games that have been indie or small development games that just dont work. EA is a big devloper I know and I had problems with Battlefield 3 on Origin that their help support did not help at all. I had Nexon contact me via my steam account and help me sort out the problem. If the owners of steam are watching this is how you do customer service.

Thanks Nexon =D




Previous deleted review below
This is awesome! I can Install it for 5 minutes...and uninstall within 5 seonds. It is truly a masterpiece in uninstall simulation....

But seriously sarcasam aside it says on your screen 0.1 or 0.2 hours I have played....thats a joke this pile of crap doesnt even load just comes up with 'This game needs Steam' If this game needed steam....how come I downloaded it for free from Steam?

So dumb. Nexxons help desk is a joke. I found some people that had same problem from 2012 and 2013 but evreything that was put forward (disable anti virus then enable again, unninstall nexxon Z then reinstall) doesnt work.

I tried finding thier customer support online rather than whats on steam...failed all I found was http://company.nexon.co.jp/en/support/contact.html and thats for IR related messages.

Was tempted to buy Dirty Bomb which is also being devloped by Nexon. Gonna add Nexxon to my list of companies I dont buy from anymore.

Techland 
Nexon
EA

Bring back Westwood and Bullfrog when companies were actually good not a pile of crap."
10432,WHERE IS THE FOV SLIDER!!!!!!!
10433,not bad
10434,please dont read this if you are cs or csgo fan  ________this game is not for tf2 fans you join server everyone is going to call you noob so the first times are bad so for that you will get kicked or banned other things are good but sometimes its going anoying with the sounds but if you are CS and zombie shooter fan than this game is good for you

10436,"It got really fun at first, a few hours later i am glued to the screen in intense... it got boring and then i realized this was a copy righted thing, which made me really mad! I watched a youtuber play this aswel and that ma
de me mad"
10437,12/10
10438,"I've never seen a worse game in the history of playing games.

WHY:
Zombies mostly win
You can't even move when you are being shot as a zombie
It takes FOREVER to kill zombies
AND it just plain sucks..."
10439,Preferiria comprarme el CS: 1.6 y ponerle un mod de zombies que jugar a esto...
10440,If you've played counter strike zombie mod Well this is just for you and the normal counter strike is in it too Lets just say counter strike 1.6 Just got REmade with Better stuff and a zombie campaight(event thingy Map changes from time to time)
10441,"Awsome game but evrey boss is hard.
I'ts reley fun dought and i think dat more peapole should play this game."
10442,"Once you get the hang of it, this is a pretty fun game and is worth a try."
10443,"i played this once then got killed by a rainbow...
"
10444,why
10445,This game have so bad graphics that any pc can play it. I'M SURE THE NES CAN RUN THIS TOO!
10446,Like Counter-Strike but much more boring.
10447,not bad game :)
10448,Only if you really don't want to purchase the original.
10449,"This is a pretty good game. Zombies, zombies,zombies and more zombies. Oh yeah did i mention that there is a zombie mode"
10450,very fun gameplay needs a better community but overall great game
10451,it's ok
10452,Good game
10453,"Its a fun game. It takes original counter strike and gives it a nice twist.
Kind of laggy, but whatever."
10454,Fun little game that you can play when you are bored
10455,"I think game is like a cs 1.6 
Its only zombie mods and new guns"
10456,"Games are too clunky even for teh older graphics, and not enough people play so u spend half the time trying to find someone else and the game ends and you lose."
10457,"I would give it a 5/10, because I really enjoy the original mode. But in my opinion, the zombiemode are just painfull. I hate it! As human you got 100 health points in maximum, but as a fucking zombie you got over 1000 health as max. Playing as a zombie is soo OP, not that funny though..
It isn't really any idea to have a lifebar if you die when a zombie just touches you, I'm not kidding! If a zombie hits you (as zombie you don't have any weapons) than you turns to a zombie directly. I will keep the game only for the original mode.


Oh, did I mention it's a pay to win game?"
10458,Nicely done - Mini approves  :D
10459,quality is garb
10460,Funny to play
10461,is good
10462,basically counterstrike 1.6 but added zombies and made it free...
10463,worst game ever 0/10 never play it!!!

10465,"How to play the game on Windows 8.1?? It crashes at begining of the load and says ""Failed to intilaze OpenGL"" what does that mean?? How to correct it and play the game?? It worked perfectly on my old laptop whit Windows XP...Plz help..."
10466,its trash
10467,Why is this a thing?
10468,every time i load the game it tells me steam is requred to play
10469,this is an awsome game
10470,Nice game but low graphics :(((
10471,this game is better than cs 1.6
10472,Ya fucking durggos                   im sassy and i aprove this message
10473,yeah its great but the zombie health is kind of too high i have to waste my ammo just to kill a stupid zombie should lower down the health by 50 percent but over all GREAT GAME
10474,"If you wanna enjoy CSS for free, download this... Why the hell not? What's the worst that could happen...? Oh... Nexon."
10475,"You see all these people dislikeing the game. STOP AND LOOK AT AT THEIR PLAYTIME. I personally LOVE this game. I'm new to it, but if you have played Combat Arms before this for a while, you'll understand and like it. Also, give this game a chance. Dont let these people hating on this game with only an average of 0.7 hours of playtime change your opinion on this game. If you dont like anything on the game, try Zombie Shelter. That is my favorite gamemode. If you still don't like it, then delete it from your computer. Its not that hard."
10476,"Everyone in the reveiw is hating on this game, but here I am going to show you proof that this is a very good game. So don't listen to the others c:


‚Ä¢ Lots of cool guns!
‚Ä¢ Pigmode (That right there deserves a thumb up!)
‚Ä¢ Like the only FPS zombie game that is free on Steam.
‚Ä¢ It's free.
‚Ä¢ Other games rather than just zombies.

That's about all I have lol, but it's not a bad game to play everyone else is just whining because it's not like CS:GO, or CS:S or any of the games in the Counter-Strike series, but it is free so download it, try it, and if you don't like it undownload it, but just don't play this game because the butthurt people below me gave it a thumbs down, and a bad review. It's honestly a great game."
10477,Worst game ever uninstall button works very well :D
10478,i like this gane but getting weapons is really annoying you ethier buy some or have to  save up to carft the the crafting part is ok but getting the stuff you need to craft takes forever but if you do save up the things you need to craft you are most likely going to get a good gun or fail the crafting which gives you no weapons but overall i will give it 9/10
10479,its greet m8 rekt mum
10480,"Ok so this game was actually really fun in the five minutes i played it. This game is great for people who love counter-strike, and over-powered zombies. Literally when you spawn as a zombie after you have been killed you have OVER 9000 HEALTH. Unless you are extremly skilled at pvp you will not survive. You can aslo hide but its pretty hard so good luck with that. The reason I like this game is that it is actually fun besides how stupid it is."
10481,"I love this game... it is very aesome and i dont know what the mixed comments is about... people need to remember its a free to play so yea, minor bugs, but quit youe b*tchin'... its FREE"
10482,"GG, turned into a zombie infront of everyone and died instantly, nuff said."

10497,"It works, the game works just like you would expect but i wouldn't be suprised if you puked over the graphics, they do truly suck, but is it worth it for a free game. Meh there are alternatives such as Americas' Army Proving Grounds Beta that look fab but with the trade off of requiring much higher spec hardware, therefore this game is intended for laptop users to enjoy at a playable framerate and also a very similar game to CS:GO"
10498,"I don't get all the negative reactions, even if this game is a shame to the name Counterstrike.
It's free!

Pros:
-Pretty straightforward crafting system
-Crafting Ingredients are pretty easy to acquire
-Good arsenal of weapons
-IT'S FREE! (Can't be pointed out too much)

Cons:
-Sometimes feels like a pay-to-win
-Once one team has the upper hand, tides cannot be turned easily
-Camping is too easy on some gamemodes (Looking at you, Zombie Hero - Italy)
-Some things are too hard to figure out (Can't give any examples BECAUSE I HAVEN'T FIGURED SOME OF IT OUT YET)
-Awkward resolutions and graphics (I use 1366 x 768, which you can't choose)
-You can't see the full window when not in Fullscreen Mode
-Some of the controls are pretty awkward
-NO FRIEND SYSTEM

10503,"Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies...*sigh*

I discovered the game sometime between late 2014 and mid 2015.

This game is terrible because of all the issues that it's plagued with. No, wait. The game is it's own bug.

You know what's cool about it? That this piece of sh_it is actually called Counter-Strike: Online (because Counter-Strike was never online). It's still a mess. 0/10 Go play CS2D, CS:GO or any other Counter-Strike game instead."
10504,"I like this game! It's free, and it's not Pay-To-Win. Look at all the negative reviews, no one plays the game! Most people who put a negative review have like a  0.5 hours record. Anyway, it's fun! It's basically a free Counter Strike 1.6, plus zombies mod! If you're really just gonna go along with  all the negative reviews, you're missing out on a free CS 1.6!"
10505,"This game is fucking shit. How it was conceived is far beyond me, as it's literally CS: Source with shitty pay2win system that will have six year olds stealthing their mom's credit card to play as a girl with a grenade launcher. I think that one sentence alone just explained the whole play experience."
10506,Nice job on the game and i give a 10/10 -Crime.Net Horror and Shooting :)

Cons:
-AWP, Autosniper shots are way off.
-Terrible mechanics
-Microtransactions are present
-Hackers
-Cheap knockoff of CS"

To be frank, I've enjoyed my time with this game. The crafting system can give as much enjoyment as a set of cases in CS:GO and isn't even close to P2W, as the AWP and other great guns are of no cost."
10513,My opinion is good game
10514,Three words that sums up this game: Pay To WIn.
10515,"It's kind of fun, even though the graphics are terrible, it crashes alot, and a lot of people hack. Crafting decent weapons is difficult, they recently made enhancing weapons nearly impossible. Not bad for free though."
10516,This game is pretty much a free counter strike but with zombies. So its pretty good 11/13

10528,"DO NOT GET THIS GAME!
1) the humans are massivly over powered u cant get near them when playing as a zombie
2) the game is so glitchy and buggy when u get shot it stalls and teleports u back a litle bit
3) don't waste precious space and get no more room in hell, if u are looking for a good free zombie/survival game thats the best one there is."
10529,"It's a fun game, I really enjoy it although im a little bit addicted. It's very difficult at times though so prepare to rage quit! The odd bug here and there for instance if you craft 2 of the same guns and destroy one to get the pieces back it actually destroys them both so watch out for that but all in all a very fun game!"

10538,no
10539,"Every time I played this I wondered why and how Nexon got the rights to Counter Strike.


Pros:
- Counter Strike for free
-Counter Strike maps and weapons
-Good modes from original CS
-Uninstall was faster than install

Cons:
- Motherfucking P2W
- Made by a shitty Korean company
- Wasted my time 
- Zombie Mode is boring as hell
- Lag out the ass
- Game goes slow when you play with bots ALONE
- Have to kill a certain amount of enemies on a difficulty to unlock the next difficulty.


Skip this and just buy a CS game."

10547,Gets boring real quick
10548,lol
10549,This is the worst zombie game I have ever played
10550,Sory For My English :P: it's a very good game it has craftable guns and it has lil cosmetics but still very fun but the problem is its is not F2P if u want guns u buy decoders and that sucks and the other thing is its not fair for new players like CS GO new player vs new players but this CS new players vs pro's. so i dont recomend this game if u are F2P and dont like people who are soo mad that u cant play becus you just started

10552,Yes uninstalls VERY quickly in fact 2 seconds.
10553,"This game is terrible very bad. Its full of camping people you die in 2 hits its basically COD in a cs go reskin, At least the unistall button and works and it unistalls quick you should try it out right now. Also it unistall in only 2 second woah it actually took 2 second try it for your self"
10554,"UPDATE 3/17/2016
The game has gotten a ""LITTLE"" better in SOME aspects.  But the new ""le-antihacker"" punkbuster clone apparently reads not only your files, but websites you visited in the past 2 days.  

Update: 10-31-2019;
It seems that CS:N:Zombies got a rebranding.
Still a terrible game from what I hear, will continue to not recommend it."
10555,this game includes shooting and other crap it is one of my favourite games. You can kill heaps of zombies and even deathmatch and classic i can't belive how many modes there are.
10556,"NOTE: if these problems are fixed in the future, i might change the rating.

This is a decent counter strike/zombie survival game with some issues:
1. this game looks like it was made with the gold source engine (same one used for half life 1)
2. (i understand this is an unfixable problem) the NA channels are always empty
3. this game never closes properly, when i close it, the stuff stays in memory, so steam constantly says im in game even though im not.
4. the gun spread is awful, and crouching doesnt do anything.
5. the craftable items only last for so many days depending on what you use to make the stuff.

but to be less critical, this game is actualy decent, it constantly rewards for time played (every got stuff for launching, playing 10 mins, playing another 10 mins, playing for 1 hr, and so on). i wish the craftables would last longer, cause i realy like how they look. if you can actualy join a game, you can have fun."
10557,ay.ya.ya
10558,Get a job and buy counter-strike or buy a good free to play like warframe or the crap tonne of free to plays out there. This is not worth the internet to download it.
10559,What happened to the zombies and when did they specifically disappear...?
10560,"Not a bad free version of counter-strike....for people who cant afford anything, this is the way to go."
10561,"Honestly it's been 7 years since I first installed the game, I've only actively played around 1 or 2 years of that time though. It might just be nostalgia of playing zombie escape on the map skylines trying to speedrun it or playing the classic game mode back when the game had over 5k active players, but I still very much like this game. You could say the game is P2W, especially now that they've added weapons where you don't even have to aim with, but if you can find a good zombie hero or zombie z server without any restrictions you're probably going to do just fine if you haven't spent any money on the game (such as myself). Occasionally you can find a classic server up and it's a pretty fun time, just don't expect the weapons to function like any regular CS weapons because they don't. It's your standard run of the mill Nexon FPS game which has surprisingly not completely died yet, unlike Combat Arms, Counter Strike Online 2, Sudden Attack 2, Titanfall Online, War Rock (maybe still alive?). This game's glory days are for sure forever lost to time, but it really is a fun time killer if you end up liking either zombie z or zombie hero, but if you're NA don't expect to have good ping, there's hardly ever a NA server up."

In rest is added only Zombies 

I recommend to try it if you want to :)"
10570,"This game is so much fun, some people say its a clone counter strike but its free so i will play this xD. But nexon security there are people who are so good it seems like the wall hack and im not sure what to do about that please fix it, thx i rate this 9/10 it would be 10/10 but for the ""people who have skill"" for example, qrcrows"

10573,"love the gameplay, graphics are a bit on the downlow but by far one of the most addictive games i have played. 7/10 IGN"
10574,its good !
10575,"How to not make a video game:

-Make one team super OP
-Use a 17 year old game engine
-Add microtransactions
-Add crafting (as opposed to actually getting a weapon)
-Make craftable weapons only last a few days
-Make everything overpriced
-Put in tons of camping locations
-Re-use content from a 10 year old game
-Your zombie is an octagon (I wish I was joking)
-Pretend it's a horror game
-Foggify old maps to pretend they are new
-Make a crappy sound play every time someone dies
-Use an over-saturated game idea
-License a completely unrelated series
-Put your company name in the title
-Make it 2GB, because that's the size a game from 17 years ago is supposed to be, right?
-Make the menus incredibly hard to understand
-Make it free to play

And have fun, your crappy game is complete."

10592,"People keep complaining about this game and about p2w. I know this game is pretty old but it's still fun to play with friends. You think this game is P2W? I don't think so, I have played this game since 2011 and i haven't spent any money into this because you can earn things from event. I know i will get so much hate but it's a good game if you give it a try :)

(Sorry i'm not good at English I just want people to enjoy this game, this game was from Nexon but it's good btw i'm not a fanboy :P)"
10593,i love this game almost as much as gmod but the thing is if u dont load it up every few days it will crash and you will have to redownload it 3 times
10594,"Nice game, a good way to spend time playing CS and the zombie mod is great."

10597,"This game is absaloutley Garbage. the worst game i have ever played
"
10598,ok game for how old it is bbs
10599,"I recomend this game. Now I know what your thinking, It's F2P and honestly in most online matches it's P2W, those words alost ALWASY turn me off from the game. However, I had fun with this game. Once I found a few friends who wanted to play the game with me, I enjoyed playing many of the different game modes. I haven't yet bought a single item from the shop and I still enjoy most of the game. If playing the zombie gamemodes isn't very fun or gets old for you, you can still play Counter Strike 1.6 for free.

I know that a lot of people are instantly turned off from the game merely by the name of the developer, Nexon, however I honestly haven't even heard of the company before I heard of this game. I don't really know anything about them but they didn't seem to do such a bad job with this game.

My only complaint is the crafting part of the game.... Stay away from that you can craft stuff but the things you craft only last for 1 or more days unless you pay money, so unless your planning on paying money on this game: Stay away from the crafting section.

Try this game out for yourself, see how you feel. Don't let the F2P aspect ruin it for you, it should be fine unless you keep away from the P2W gamemodes."
10600,Awesome game.
10601,"Felt unclean looking at it, felt unclean downloading it, felt unclean playing it. Getting ready to walk all the way to Jerusalem while only living off tasteless crackers and holy water tomorrow, after I have said sorry to my computer while cuddling with it in my bed for my act."
10602,Worst game ever. well why. i cNT EVEN PLAY IT BECAUSE IT FRIKEN NEVER LOADS MG
10603,"If you're looking for an improved version of Counter-Strike 1.6 then you have found it. At the moment, there are only a few mods available - Standard(like normal CS 1.6 pub servers), Deathmatch,  Zombiemod. You are given the choice to pay for cool weapons with real-life money but you really don't have to as you get awarded with weapons everyday you play. In competitive(pub or deathmatch) AK47 is still the best weapon. In zombie-mod there are supply box drops which give you paid weapons for that round for free.

I would say that the only thing missing in this game are the following mods:
War3, War3 + ZM, War3 + DM, SuperHero, SuperHero + DM.

I hope Nexon is reading this and will add the mods I mentioned above because then there will be absolutely no reason to play Counter-Strike 1.6.

Also, unlike Counter-Strike 1.6 decals on client-side match server-side so you can aim pretty accurately.

Overall rating: 9/10. If the mods mentioned above get implemented then this is totally 10/10.

FYI: This game is not pay2win, you can pay for weapons but its not required. This is a free game, Nexon has to pay for the hosting and other stuff somehow."

Don't spend a single cent on this game. 
Ok nexon if you are going to bring classic maps and weapons atleast make the engine a bit better , as it still looks like it uses gold source.
The weapons that are added last five seconds and do no damage unless you paid extra for that. You can also buy 10000 points for  a ""great"" price of 1000$. In the end don't play or spend a cent unless you just want to fund nexon's porn fund."

If you didn't want to play the game with zombies, then why did you download it? I have a feeling, and this is a little offensive, that a lot of the negative reviews are counter-strike fan boys who get their nuts in a knot just because someone came along and made something different. Though honestly I don't like playing with anybody but friends because most of the random people that join are idiots who either hack or literally have no idea what they're doing."
10630,Played it a bit. I think it's ok.
10631,"lets some check this game.

1.looks ugly, im not graphic men
2. gameplay sucks 
3.weapons crafting with items, nice
4.your can not without money buying chars

go and load counter strike 1.6 or global offensive, nexon your sucks to much"
10632,"Welp, this game is so ammazing! I love the uninstall button! So good!"

10634,"I definitely recommend Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies to the silly boys and girls who want to play one of the worst games available on Steam!

Thumbs up for Nexon which did an incredible job publishing such a horrible game."
10635,Nope dont play this game... better to buy cs go if you like cs
10636,its shit
10637,Bloody good game M9's
10638,It was easier to find the uninstall button then the start button.
10639,I Love Old CSS/CS 1.6. I Love The Feel When I Play CSS. I Love Older Games They Make Me Feel Nostalgia. I Hope Other's Can Enjoy This Has Much As I Do When i play it
10640,Meh its okay
10641,This game is basically old CS with meh graphics. I give this game a 8.5/10 because you can obtain rare items/guns without putting a dime into this game. It has unique gamemodes containing your old classic favorite CS gametypes. Don't listen to the hate reviews most of them is because the graphics.
10642,I like it ;)
10643,"wole cs:go :D ale gram w to :D
"
10644,"This is the worst Counter-Striker game I've ever played, but it makes sense because it wasn't made by Valve. There is a decent ranking system and crafting system to get new guns with new skins. The actual gameplay itself makes me wonder why so many people still play this game. There are even people who are so good, it seems like they must've spent hundreds of hours in this game. Overall, for a free game, its fine."
10645,"Pay Day 2 for poor 
(must invest lots to enjoy majority of the game hint hint)"
10646,nice game
10647,great game for reliving stress
10648,"This game is actually garbage, it almost brought me to suicide.      Please dont play this game."
10649,"Right, so downloaded this game and was extrememly skeptical due to the mass of down votes. Honestly, this is not the ""top"" game, thats for sure, but its definately a laugh, and in my opinion abit of old school fun, just to mess around on with friends, this pay to win thing people are saying is bs, havent pent a penny, the majority of people that vote down this game have played under 0.5 hours which is not enough to instantly say a game was sh*&, honestly its a good laugh with some mates and shouldnt be hated on as much as it currently is, also its free... what do you want some top tier zombie shooter like dying light?"
10650,this game is the best! It brings back memories to me
10651,game sucks ... say what you want ... 1/10 (1 Because its CS )
10652,great game really like the zombie idea
10653,Wow Nexon now messed up Counter Strike to go along with Combat Arms
10654,"10/10 It was ""okay"" -IGN"
10655,"This game is a shitty cash-in on the ever-popular zombie genre. The graphics suck, the weapons might as well be pop-guns, and the balancing is shit. Seriously, I fire at zombies as a human and they can keep right on coming with no penalty, but when I'm a zombie, the knockback from enemy fire essentially freezes me in place. Also, the hitbox for when a human is ""infected"" is inconsistent; I can be infected by a zombie when they're two bodies' worth away, but I have to practically be right in someone's face to even try to infect them. In addition, there was a single human left before the zombies won, but I couldn't get to him because models collide with each other, and there was another zombie RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE HUMAN WHO WASN'T DOING SHIT! Because of that and the model collision, I couldn't reach the human, and thus couldn't do shit except wait for the human to kill me! Shitty game. I regret installing it, and if you are smart, you won't install it!"
10656,Amazing!
10657,Good game but fps problem :/
10658,"Forget about all the crash related reviews, it works!
Really fun game with some good game modes and a lot to do. 
A little heavy on the micro transactions but its a FTP so that's kinda expected. You don't really need them to win, everything just looks cooler.
Achivements are a grind though! Hundreds of those, thousands of these. 
All-in-all, worth it because it's free"
10659,Counter Strike...Zombies....Enough Said
10660,Nexon is worse than EA
10661,SUGOI !!!! SUGOI !!!! SUGOOOOOOOOOOOOI !!!!
10662,Awesome Game I Recomendet
10663,"i think this is the best game ive played
"
10664,"Sp00ky zombiez chaiz meh i became 1 of them 9000/10  like skyrim with guns and zombies
"
10665,"UPDATE: The game now works, Spotify seemed to be causing it to crash

It's okay, I guess.

Nexon have a reputation for Pay2Win games, but it seems that this game breaks from the mould. Would recommend if you like CS 1.6 and want something different."
10666,Id rather spend eternity in a tube wahtching while some idiot destroys all my dreams and everything else I once loved.
10667,"is really fun and you can play with your friends
"
10668,"Lets make this clear: lots of people hate this game because, well, its not even a real counterstrike title. It was developed by Nexon Korea Corp. That does not stop it from being a good game. It includes all of the regular CS game modes and some new zombie modes. It has all of the classic maps plus some new ones. Warning: It can be glitchy sometimes. Also do your best to pick servers with few people because of spawn camping. I recommend this game :)"
10669,"After 6 hours of playing I have come to a conclusion. This game has a lot of adds to the original Counter Strike 1.6, especially the new zombie mods and weapons. It is, somehow, a P2W but that doesn't mean it is not funny anymore. On casual mods (Normal, Death-match, Respawn) the weapons work as skins, since they make the same damage as the replaced weapon. Totally recommended for those who want a free Counter Strike 1.6 copy with premium, no-lag servers and pre-installed zombie mods. I also recommend this game for those who have a lot of time to waste because trust me, Zombie Shelter in 2 (2 vs 0) will take A LOT."
10670,"To be honest, My opinions for this game are mixed. But if you are looking for a game to play just to pass the time, then sure play this, but if ur playing it like you would play CS:GO (competitively), aint gonna happen buddy."
10671,The uninstall button works awesomely! the P2W guns are overpowered and you dont stande a chance! its that good!
10672,"I love this game, but recently i've been facing serious lag issues even though my internet is fine. The game suddenly freezes for 3-6 seconds with an error message saying something like CL_FLUSHENTITYPACKET. Please resolve this bug!"
10673,I now need life counseling
10674, For my first expericanes this game is decent. 6/10 But I wouldn't recomendd it. Just go buy CS:GO on summer sale.
10675,Veri gud
10676,Dont get
10677,Just don't even bother. Think I need to start reading game reviews before even downloading them.
10678,This game is just mostly Combat Arms with some Counter-Strike maps and weapons. This game isn't recomended because it is broken and might as well be called Combat Arms:Zombies.
10679,iz gud
10680,"The game is pretty solid, though I wish it was easier to get weapons."
10681,You want a good Counter Strike Zombie game? Come to Zombies on Drugs in 1.6.
10682,"No idea what people are shitting about, you can easly find a classic Cs version in this game (yes also the typical game mode, weapons, and everything you are used to).

i dint bother to try out the zombie gimmick thing thou.

i basicly got 1.6 for free whats not to like"
10683,Meh it has 1.6 graphics and the bots talk which is really annoying. 2/10 don't play
10684,"this game is awesome
"
10685,i like but why is counter strike all of them not free i mean i like but uh pls add free to play agree like i dont like it much doe so ya
10686,"LITERALLY THE WORST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED, this deserves some titles: Rage Simulator, Dieing Simulator, Pay2Win Simulator, probably some more but honestly i went 2-50 in deathmatch and i just gave up and quit. I could be someone in any game but this one. The only reason i played was beause i wanted to play a game like CS:GO so i was gonna play Combat Arms but I forgot my password so decided to try this out since I havn't played in a while and that was such a mistake. If your gonna play, just play the zombie survival, NEVER STEP FOOT IN TEAM DEATHMATCH. I know combat arms is sorta pay to win but who cares, at least no one spawn camps and endlessly kills you with a minigun or SNIPER (all people use in CSN: Zombies."
10687,this is a asome game somepeaple shouldplay it
10688,wasn't this a zombie game at one point?
10689,"it is a free FPS ,with  moderate crafting.


ALL IN ALL  7/10 its a good game, graphics could be better"
10690,And I thought Algerbra II was bad...
10691,"Has good content in this game gone too far? Can we prove that this is better than it looks? I HAVE STRIKING EVIDENCE!
Firstly, it is free to play, that could mean it's low quality, or does it? No, not in this game. Let me say to you why. It is basicly the original Counter-Strike, with extra unlockable weapons, CS:S skins, zombies, a Human Scenario mode, and some other stuff. And it's F2P. While the normal CS is just, CS without all this! What's your say now? This is clearly much better. That's the reason why, I recommend this. Now, if I may say, normal CS and maybe CS:S is a waste of money, I'm so sorry for Gabe and his awesome crew. THIS IS A AWE-INSPIRING GAME CONFIRMED!"
10692,the worst copy of Counter Strike 1.6. I must cry because its so bad :/
10693,i love this game is a good game if u are board and u dont lag to bad. this game is amazingly fun to play custom with friends
10694,looove it
10695,"The games ending was the best ive ever seen. The final scene I loved from it was the ""Uninstallation"" part."
10696,I liked the original counter-strike but it is now outdated and sluggish. This game is pretty bad. Looks terrible plays even worse. I cannot recommend this game. Saddens me to say this.
10697,good game
10698,It's so good I can't launch it!
10699,"It's basically a free2play version of Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Condition Zero combined with tons of gamemodes, guns, and maps. (It's also just a port of CSO.)It's definetly fun. Don't listen to the hate reviews. This game is awesome!"
10700,"I totally recomend this game,but only if you don't own CS 1.6 and are obsessed with de_dust2"
10701,I dissmantled everything I had but I really need more materials so can I dissmantle the game too?  Seriously though dissmantle weapons ONLY and those that last atleast 10 more days otherwise you won't get shit.
10702,"First of all. If you came here expecting a normal CS experience. You should leave because this game is absoultly nothing like CS.
If you came here to shoot down mobs of zombies with a giant golden decked out LMG, then you came to the right place.
This game I can see a person spending hours playing because as far as I have noticed so far, it dosen't get boring. 
There are several different game modes, tons of different guns to use, a crafting system, character customization, clans, families, and leagues.
If you can look past the graphics and aren't expecting an average CS game.
I think you're in for a good fucking time."
10703,"is very bad game, shitty."
10704,"i dont recommend this game for a few reasons:
1) graphics. normally i dont mind much about graphics, but it has to be decent at least to the point of the demands of today
2)gameplay. lots of glitches. sucky animations, and many disconnections. unless you can deal with this then i would recommend counterstrike global offensive. but wait for the sale. it will be well worth it.
                                                                                                                                    The End"
10705,It first started out as a okay game but after a while with the lack of maintencae of the game and such the whole thing just fell apart. Lack of innovation of the match ups and nothing really new added within the roster.
10706,"cutting off my own penis would be more enjoyable than playing this ot any other NEXON game 

What you'll hate: 1.NEXON in general
                             2.This game
                             3. Anyone who says this game is good

What you'll enjoy: 1. Deleting all the files that have something to do with this 
                               2. Bleaching your eyes for looking at this game
                               3. Slaming your face in a car door
                               4. Rethinking what you've done with your life after playing this
                               5. Hunting down the develepors 
                               6. Years of psycological repair

                               8. And anything that doesn't involve playing this game"
10707,I love this game
10708,"Good game and alot of coll stuf also intense in some moments!
"
10709,SO CRAP
10710,"Don't expect anything revolutionary, but it's a fun little game to play if you are bored"
10711,I Think That You Should Play This Game Because: 1.It's A Great Game 2.It Has Awesome Reskins Of The Guns 3.Even TF2 Promoted The Game With The AWPer Hand
10712,hell.

[i]Throwback to Glitches and Stupid Fun[/i]

[b]Pros:[/b][list]
[*]Stupid Fun
[*]Glitches are Unintentionally Useful
[*]Pay-to-Win Unnecessary
[*]PvP PvE and Survival
[*]Different Zombie Classes/Game Modes
[*]Great Game to BS too
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b][list]
[*]Sometimes Laggy (Only Lagged Once, but friends lagged a few times)
[*]Graphics and CS 1.6 engine seems out of date
[*]Lack of Tutorial for New Modes
[*]User Interface and Inventory may seem difficult to navigate
[*]You'll Die a LOT
[*]Going to have to learn how to play
[/list]

[b]Summary:[/b]
This game has went through significant improvements from it's first release and the pay-to-win aspect is not as apparent as other players make it seem. This game holds a lot of fun game modes and the community is relatively nice as both new and experienced players can easily get into a PvP match with little introduction.

[b]Overview and Experience:[/b]
When my friends and I first downloaded this game, we jokingly wanted to play a game with poor reviews just to see how bad it was, but surprisingly we ended up playing two five-hour sessions considering how fun it was. Honestly, we were expecting an inbalanced game of pay-to-win players and the usual hack sessions that comes with the CS 1.6 experience. Surprisingly however, the game did not seem to have much, if any, people hacking to win.

At first glance, the game seems unfair as zombies can either be blown to oblivion by the surviving humans or humans can be overwhelmed by a zombie spawning amongst a ""cheap"" spot. To be fair, this game encourages your knowledge of well defended positions and map usage to either survive or flank your enemies.

What really makes this game come to life is the usage of the glitches present and the stupidity that comes from being chased down by a horde of zombies or hanging off a ledge while zombies use their abilities and grenades to pick you off. Essentially the game becomes a glorified hide-and-seek or king of the hill as you try to survive against other players in your favorite CS maps.

Another enjoyable aspect of the game is the mission modes such as Escape and Shelter that puts a different spin on the game with new maps that are custom made to this game. Escape was a fun run and gun mode that has you scrambling to reach the exit in different areas; while Shelter was a survival mode where you protected your base from hordes of NPC zombies as you scrounge for both supplies and money as you build up turret defenses and walls to secure your dwelling.

One of the downsides of the game is the lack of tutorial for some of the new game modes as they only teach you the PvP and survival modes in the beginning. So in some of the PvE modes you're going to either rinse and repeat a lot to understand what you need to do or hopefully have a more experience player show you the ropes, which actually does occur fairly often.

A downside of the game, which in my opinion does not affect gameplay too much, is the need to continutally create weapons and items via blueprints to keep utilizing the higher end ones. However, as powerful as the guns are, they seem to little much in PvP modes as most of the time you would need a whole squad to help kill a zombie.

Another aspect that seems unnecessarily difficult to process is the user interface as it mostly seems crowded and sometimes difficult to find certain objects you want to use such as costumes and guns that are on a limited time usage. Although after a few minutes of use, it becomes relatively understandable to use albeit dated.

[b]Last Thoughts:[/b]
This game feels like a throwback to old school games where you would do the cheapest thing to live. And that's good. Part of the enjoyment comes from unintentionally phasing through floors or on top of objects to find a once-in-a-while hiding spot and compared to most zombie survival games where you must rely on more of the traditional map knowledge and weapons to win.

This game received a lot of poor reviews from when it was first released and even though it seems like a dated game with new modes, it's a lot of fun to play when you just want to BS around and have some stupid fun to your line up.
Chat Conversation End
"
10716,This game is a free to play game so you really can't say it sucks because it's like a counter strike free to play not a demo but not the whole package. But it's really fun i reccomend this 7.5/10
10717,"Why the fuck are people hating on this game. Its just the first counter strike but with more stuff anf FREE! And dont hate on graphics, its about gameplay and fun factor. Strongly love zombie escape!"
10718,"I can sadly no longer recommend this game. I've been playing since day one (western release not CSO). I loved this game to death. I met so many awesome people through here. It's one of the only few free to play games I spent money on.The maps were fantastic. The variety of game modes was insane. New characters and weapons kept the game fresh. There was a tutorial mode for first time CS players. The gameplay was CS 1.6 at it's finest. So... what happened?

The servers kept getting worse and worse. Servers weren't region locked so people from across the world would join NA servers and lag 24/7. Fast weapon switching was never fixed. Matchmaking was dead from the beginning. They fucked up the server browser. The DLC characters feel overpriced. Some guns are just clealy better than others making the game feel P2W.  No one knowns how to properly host rooms.  There's no Original competitive scene in this game. The main menu is still in a windowed 4:3 resolution.

There's just oo many problems to be fixed. It's kinda too late too cause they are so many big names in the CS community who bashed on the game. The game isn't going to grow. They marketed the game so poorly that no wonder people find this game as a joke. Some people don't even know you can play classic CS in this game. It's fucking stupid.

Sorry Nexon. You tried. Glad you brought this game to the west, but because of poor marketting, you fucked yourself over.

Hopefully you'll release CSO2 in the west and not fuck up next time."
10719,its a pretty nice game but i cant understand why  i cant join whatever im downloading it again and hoping to be fixed
10720,9.5/10

10722,"Not open the game ._.
I played 85.4 hours, was one update and not open...
"
10723,"Boring, unstable, essentially pay to win and not worth your time."
10724,Just play the original mode which is always de_dust 2. The zombies part is where the p2w starts.

10727,It's a shitty game but it's free and actually pretty fun to play.
10728,"i tried it cause it was a counter strike game and then when i launched it,there was a whole lotta disapointment. In trainining the zombies are op asf and one hit your dead!?!? wtf is with this game. Gameplay is not bad but it could be better. Graphics are like neutral. I recomend this game to only true fans of cs. If your not one then i dont recomend this game to you"
10729,it is ok for a free zombie game
10730,"Uninstallns NICE and fast! So give it a try maybe, be sure to turn the volume down before the irritating, repetitive sounds rip you right out of the game! give it a spin because apparently 1.6 (old school counter strike) lovers enjoy it!

10731,Best game in 2001!
10732,"Just play on Zombie servers in CS 1,6 , Source or GO . Don't waste your time with this crap 3.5/10"

10735,"This game is amazingly well made for a mod from the first Counter Strike game, it also comes with the first CS game ever made! graphics are bad but its from an old classic so what do you expect, still great, highly recommend. While I have not played much (Got it saturday) it defiently caught my attention and was very well created, lots of gamemodes to play, unique guns and the multiplayer is great!, 10/10"
10736,"VERRY SHIT

10737,This game should be removed from steam worst game from counter strike i have even played this game kills the whole counter strike series
10738,GO FUCK USELF

10/10."
10740,"The game, if it wasn't for everything that you're almost forced to buy if you don' t want your ass handed to you, is pretty fun, other than the fact that the game is not balanced at all. Honestly, the best part about the game is the fact that you can uninstall it."
10741,Good game
10742,that game is BAD
10743,"I played this game then I play the other games.  I rate this game 10/10(0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
Played atleast 12 hours I think 0 zombies killed.  Damage done to zombies 101,203,092,143,489,137,847,843,21 probably.

"
10744,"This is a very unique experience and totally changes the dynamics of counter strike. The PvE was somewhat dry in my opinion, and resembled Sven: Co-Op in that you essentially plow your way alongside other players through a linear map fighting back wave after wave after wave of enemy and completing certain tasks (usually blowing up a barrier that has 30,000 health) to get to the next area. There are buy zones interspersed for you to load up on ammo or switch out guns and it usually culminates in a big boss fight. It's kind of droll and there's not much of a challenge.

WHERE THIS REAAAALLLY ****REAAAAAAAAAAAALLLY**** shines however is the PvP mode where some people are zombies and some CTs each round (randomly selected).

Each zombie type has special powers, like an iron maiden it can slam down to stun enemies and hide behind, or a hoard of bats that grabs the human you aim it at and drags him toward you. The humans (CTs) have a slew of all the classic CS guns and some extras, with a much higher ammo capacity. 

This mode can be SUPER intense as you spawn throughout familiar classic CS maps and try to get to high ground with other humans, since one hit from a zombie and you become one and join the hunt. Zombies have thousands of health points, but are slowed down by being hit so a group of humans can often protect themselves or give another a chance to excape, but once the guy next to you takes a scratch he'll kill you. 

Playing with just a couple people is really cool too depending on the map... it becomes more like hide and seek and can be VERY intense. I played with 2 others on the classic estate map and I kept jumping as I was attacked out of nowhere, since the maps are darkened to create a tense ambience. 

This mode makes it SO worth the download and since it is  free game, you've GOT to try it out... I was hooked after a couple rounds. 

Happy hunting! :)"
10745,its cs 1.6 with Nexon's name slaped infront of it. But at least the uninstall button still works.
10746,No haters allowed to open this game... This game is full of awesomeness... i dont know what you guys are talking bout :D

10761,zombies have to much health but still pretty cool game
10762,"Really terrible tbh, CS 1.6 graphics xD"
10763,horrible. not fun.
10764,HA! no....
10765,"Clicked ""Play"" after installing and game told me ""This game requires Steam""

10/10 Would uninstall again"
10766,"Very nice game!
"
10767,"Requires running as an Administrator, so it can load a kernel-level anti-cheat driver.
Uninstall was not clean, requiring OS reinstall to get back to normal."
10768,Why the hell did i even install this game in the first place?
10769,Being completely honest I've never hated a nexon game so much.
10770,The ugly redheaded stepchild of Killing Floor.
10771,This game is perfect for necrophiliacs as there is plenty of man on dead man action ;)
10772,"ciekawie zrobiona, fajna grafika< super zrobione anim,acje o raz postacie. Nie trzeba mieƒá dobrego komputra by zagraƒá w w tƒÖ gre. Po jakim≈õ czasie cz≈Çowiek zaczyna graƒá na≈Çogowo.

10777,"Why?
Cosmetics are new, but they destroy hitboxes.
New weapons that are infinitely better than the original ones, which happen to be locked behind a paywall.
No one cares about the zombies mode.
Weird drop system and confusing as hell UI.
Why was this game made?"
10778,"Fun CS type game where you can fight hordes of zombies or play CS proper.That is serch and destroy,team deathmatch,free for all etc. If you like or liked CS 1.6 then this is for you couse it uses the same mechanics as CS 1.6 and adds more.Try it out and be the judge for you're self."
10779,Its ok i wouldn't reccomed it if you have CS GO or CS but if you wanna practice before you get CS GO when you get cash this is a good way to practice :)
10780,this game is just ok but there is a lot to do .
10781,"A fun free to play game, would recommend. Haven't played it long but played enough to know its good"
10782,15 minutes of this game is all you need to wanna kill yourself 0/10 would never play again...
10783,For all veiwers this video makes the game look really bad this game is a fun and sometimes hard to play game give it a try.
10784,I would say counter-strike global offensive or csgo this is a stupid game it looked like fun but everytime i try to join it crashes
10785,"Counter-Strike Nexon:Zombies is a great alternative if you dont want to buy the paid counter-strike games.
In general i give this game a 6.5/10 not bad and not very good just a normal f2p fps game."
10786,I think this game is great but the skins for your guns should be improved.
10787,–≠–¢–û –ì–û–í–ù–û!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10788,I Love This Game So Much ^^
10789,"Stupid programmers, on top of recycling old footage, you can't figure out how to make a good game.

Free was already too much."
10790,"idk wat u guys r talking about its gud
but in a bad way"
10791,PvP is decent. Free counter-strike!
10792,"I can't close the game. 10/10















Seriously. I cannot close it. It's stuck in background processes and I can't force close it. Please send help."
10793,"im not giving no because i hate it, im neutral and if there was a button for that it would be good, but getting to the point. the game isnt bad but it isnt entirelly good, i would say this game is worth a try if you feel like. the controls are nice and responsive. the graphics could be a little better but its a free game so that excusable. so the game is ok but not good, but is also not bad"
10794,call of duty players playing counter-strike nexon zombies be like how do you aim down your sights how do you sprint
10795,"If there's any faith in humanity left in you, please trust me when I say this is not a game.It is a huge pile of absolute shait."
10796,hi
10797,"In short: you're better off playing zombies on Garry's mod, another zm game, or in CS even."
10798,Its good for people who want a free cs1.6.BUT DONT PLAY THE ZOMBIE MODE
10799,Good game its like cs go but bad grafics :)
10800,"First ""This game requires steam"" Then ""The app is already running"" Then something supposedly related to Counter Strike opened and my eyes bled. Consult a doctor before downloading."
10801,"Good game 7/10
Its a bit p2w, but its fun to play with freinds.
and you dont need to waste money, its a choice but i like to play either way."
10802,0/10
10803,so many bugs and so much pay for guns buy counter strike
10804,GG
10805,"There are a lot of people that hate this game, but it's really not that bad. It's the original Counter-Strike for free with zombies, a built in hidden mod (one map), soccer, and other stuff. Only reason I don't play it more is that Windows 8.1 gives me weird things. If you aren't on Windows 8.1, you could consider putting time into this game, if you don't already have the original Counter-Strike. Even with Windows 8.1 bullshit, I still found myself enjoying some of the mods like the hidden and soccer, so don't think it's a complete waste of time."
10806,Funny :D
10807,"pay to win :( 

"
10808,ok for a free to play but im gunna say there are better free to plays out there
10809,"Respawn, jump get sniped,

10819,This is literally the worst game I have ever played. I grew up playing CS 1.x through to CS:GO today and thought I'd try out 1.6 style with zombie mod. This isn't 1.6 with zombie mod this is some hack job of a game using 1.6 style. Do yourself a favor and play CS 1.6 on a zombie mod server it will be more fun and you won't give this game any more players so games like this can go die. Uninstall before you play.
10820,"This game is balls.
Pay to win.

Come for the zombies, leave because it stinke"
10821,"10/10

10822,"Great game, love the zombie modes"
10823,open game and it said this game requires steam to work WTF! best game ever 21/10
10824,Infested with microtransactions. Kids with overpowered guns that were bought through microtransactions will camp in a corner and win the match. Every. Single. Time. Only play if you have a craving for some tasty cancer.
10825,GOOD GAME BUT THE GRAPHICS NEED TO BE BETER
10826,"Hi this game was very offensive and disturbing my 4 years old son tried it and he was eaten alive on the game by a zombie. So now after that he always do a ""dubbelspolning"" on the toilet becasue he have to poop a large ammount of blood. So for any dads out there i do not recommend this game it¬¥s also very rascist against kids and Zombies"
10827,1
10828,I highly reccomend playing the non zombie cause all the people in the game just5 came some where that you just have no way of getting to them and they use lmg's and ik some of you that are reading this do that. so its decent game i guess i play the regular non zombie and enjoyed it better. cheers.
10829,"Freemium, good for wasting 5 minutes shooting zombies, repetitve after that."
10830,And I thought Combat arms was a pretty bad game...
10831,fun ass game play now
10832,Made me feel like a weaboo
10833,"I'm a sad man, now."
10834,Basically if Left 4 Dead and Counter-Strike had children. Thousands of them. And they were all autistic kids that were given guns and told to shoot each other.
10835,No. Just no
10836,"Not really that good, hate the olf fashion graphics :("
10837,Cool!
10838,"Loved playing Counter Strike: Online using proxy servering, and glad that it's released in the United States."
10839,"This game sucks. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Let it die a silent death, which is far more than this steaming pile of a game deserves. I pity the devs that wasted the last 16 years turning an old mod into a useless hunk of code. I know they've been at it since CS's inception because if they had come out of their basements for two minutes, they would see that the game they based this garbage mod off of is already both obsolete and modernized via new releases (i.e. CS:GO). Sorry guys, time to stop worrying about this one and start modding CS:GO. Maybe you can have zombies in it before the Mars Colony is christened. I doubt it, though. SHAME ON YOU."

10845,I dont like it..
10846,"This Is a fun game but it is slightly repetive after a while.
Pros
1. The game has a very creative advancement process that involves starting out quite weak weapon wise but advanceing fairly quickly.

2.The game has fun missions that are randomly picked or you can choose.

3. You get to play counterstrike for free.

Cons.

1. The zombies in multiplayer are VERY OP and hard to kill

2. The boss fights can be long and grueling."

10855,Game won't even load I have tried almost a 100 times and it won't work and it downloads something called NEXON Hack saver. I don't recomend this for any steam player famous or not.
10856,"This game is crap. Its existence on Steam is shocking. Its essential a free Counter-Strike 1.6 with microtransactions but neutered, in terms of weapon stats, weapon damage, weapon recoil and overall gunplay. The half-baked zombies modes are there only to justify its release on Steam. As if people would flock to a 15 year old game but with zombies.
The menus are inconveniently convoluted and are heavily reminiscent of Cross-Fire, another south korean developed game and the microtransactions are redundant and insignificant. This game is pure derivative crap. A tumor on the belly of the monster that is Counter-Strike."
10857,fun id you havent try gungame its the funnest one onher.lilke on cod blackops.super fun gametype! would recomend!
10858,THIS GAME IS SHIT!

10862,Worst game ever
10863,Amazing game its really fun but i have a friend who wanted to play but steam and valve wouldn't let him see the game in the shop to download it and everyone else can we its because he lives in israel and the counter-terrorist are based on israel police so that sucks the best way to sort this is if they do an option for when they download i asking if they're ok with the games creation
10864,"Best uninstall simulator 2015, 10/10"
10865,Still better than BF4
10866,"You remember those shitty cs 1.6 zs games?
Its this but now with pay2win elements"
10867,shit game just playing bocz mi pc low for anther games
10868,Should give it a go
10869,"This is an amazing game in which I still play even after I got all of the other counter-strikes. I really enjoy it and I recommend this game to anyone just starting on steam. It has low requirements meaning if your computer is crap, you may still be able to run this."
10870,Meh. Just go buy CS:GO and don't ever download this crap.
10871,"Counter Strike proves, once again, it's core concept is still solid enough to continue on to this very day. While there are plenty of mods around for zombies inside CS 1.6, let alone Source, the game does pitch collectibles, crafting weapons, a neat variety of zombies and bosses, and it overally looks visually appealing and functions well.

However, on the other hand, the crafting system always feels like it's against me, collectible items can sometimes drop in places where you can't get them (though to be fair, the items are locked to a player for a certain time so no item stealing), and weapons you do craft don't last very long without the right materials. The game can get kind of tedious at times, being either too hard to play with basic weapons provided, or too easy with some of the overpowered craftable ones. And even with the super weapons you can craft, some bosses are tedious and generally have the same set-up: boss is big and powerful, hordes attack, do a special thing to avoid an attack. You'll also have to dump a bit of cash to get enough materials to reliably have a good time, though the game is quite generous with points for certain items in the shop.

So...can I recommend it? I guess, tenatively. F2P won't have as much fun unless you kick in a few bucks, and that's up to you if you have the disposible income. Most will probably want to look elsewhere, but it's free, so take a peek. You get a good starter pack, you do get daily rewards and there's nothing to lose from trying."
10872,"AWSOME  game
"
10873,good game
10874,I really like this game the zombie part is the best except the weapon part.  some weapons are overpowered like skull 9. i wish Nexon would give more or better selection of weapons. I'm sure there are people who hacked this game to get stuff but people who are trying the get crap. you can play it but you will se a hacker im 100% sure.
10875,"That game is cs:cz but is based on p2w...... horrible

better uninstall


69/10 would bang"
10876,The best part is the trailer
10877,epicly epicly epic game
10878,"The korean edition of Counter-Strike strikes again with it's poorly executed features and no improvement on the source material named Zombie Mod. 

Pros:
Offers classic maps from previous CS titles

Cons: 
Incredibly unfriendly user-interface both for the menu's and the buy menu in-game. 
Unoriginal and inconsistent zombie models. 
Horrible new gun models/skins.
In-game cash shop.
Low population.
Too many game modes lowers server populaton even more.


"
10879,Joshy Approves
10880,It even smells like shit
10881,Very fun. I played this game for the first time yesterday and love it. I am a little confused on the whole buying and crafting situaion in this game but other then that I r8 gr8 8/8.
10882,"Terrible, Just plain terrible. When your a zombie and get shot you slow down hella. And zombies have to much health for running so fast. The survivors have no chance if they just downloaded the game. Just stop"
10883,"From what I've seen so far, It's just CS 1.6 with a few new things. One. Instead of every weapon having a slight variation in how much they slow you down, Everything turns you into a turtle. Thus resulting in the Panic-inducing crawl of death.

Two. From what i've experienced, you BARELY find zombie servers.

Three. No Ranking. I was once a very loyal Nexxon customer. I loved Combat Arms. It would *note, WOULD. not will.* pair you with someone of your own rank to save frustration. But then came the Hackers. This game has the same problem as combat arms does now. No ranking. No pairing. Lots of Hackers.

Overall, I would not reccomend this game to anyone who isn't good at counter strike, and dealing with Hackers.

5/10. Would play again, just to have a laugh or two.














"
10884,"This is best game ever i played. I am from polish (U know i am good english).Too much fun,Zombies and The Most Thing Bots.Bots are great for begginers.There are many gamemods like:
Zombies:
U know how to play
Escape Zombie:
In this gamemode you have escape,before players (Zombies) get you. You have limited time. If time gets 0 whetever or not zombie wins. There is not many map but its fun to play. Some escape must like how many distance you go,survive and wait for chopper,and others. The Most Points Wins!
Soccer:
Well Valve thank you for that adding this gamemode. Easy rule, get the ball,and get goal to get points. But hey! For getting close to enemy goal will couse damage you. And the most impoart you CAN respawn. If you die you will respawn where you die. The most points Wins!
Original:
You know what is this.
Zombie Save:
In this mode it never ends untill save house will be destroyed by zombies.It took me 2 Hours to end it.Its Very Fun. You cant win! Like a Soccer you respawn die. When you die you will respawn to save house+you lose all items what you got but thats ok for me. Well you can build sentry and others,that makes game long. It is fun,but boring for some players.
Zombie Co-Op:
In this gamemode you actully killing Bot Zombies,NOT players. In this mode is survive and escape,then chapter will change to boss battle,that means you need defeat boss to complete chapter. You lose if all players is dead. You can still have fun pressing r (I think) it will restart and you with friends trying again. Still you CAN respawn. But if you keep dying the time will make extend.
Thats all i can tell some gamemode.Others all there but i dont remember.
That only who pissing me off is creating weapon,its real s*** like you always fail to craft some weapons,sometimes you have luck,sometimes not.I always have't got lucky so this thing pisses me off.
This is: BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!

The weapon crafting is easy and realy cool and being able too level up is just fun. I love the weapon crafting and getting random weapons everytime :) this game is alot of fun and hey, it free so just download it."

10896,"From what i have played so far, the game is great to play with friends who do not have money to buy other CS titles, usually if you can get them into a private game its pretty fun, if you want you can have a mixture of friends and bots. When it comes down to public matches, i only play public zombies, none of the other modes, for I do not want to be turned away from the game after seeing players with OP gear and weapons because they dished out loads of money toward the title. But, when you get some friends and play some matches, you will see it is not that bad of a game, especially seeing that its free."
10897,<3 Nice Game <3

Because any person who has truely spent time playing 1.1 to 1.6 will understand that this free game(despite microtrasaction items that dont effect the game) is a great find for a populated game with mods and classic i say if you love cs 1.6 give this a game a try even for a couple of matches and relive why we love the cs franchise so much."

10923,it just like counter strike 1 only free
10924,"This is going to be a short review for only the most basics of my thoughts of the game. The game have limited potentials, plenty of bugs and glitches which makes the game unpleasent. Gameplay is casual, nothing special.

Issues with daily missions and special missions due to bugs such as kills not getting registered a lot of times. Is it pay to win? You can pay to win yes, you can buy the strongest weapons which will give you a huge adventage in Zombie or scenario mods.

Might have been better if instead of a Korean development team a Japanese team would have been choosen (would be less buggy). I would say it's good for practicing shooter games but not a competative game at all."

10933,"Okay this game is cs1.6 MMO. pay2win, overpowered. if there's no pay2winners on server. and if you EVER played any cs before, this game will REALLY easy for you. i was going 40-0, because there's new gamers not like cs1.6. no pro gamers. well when i was going 40-0, someone joined and look what does he have :
A Scoped rifle that's firing like a M4, so it isn't semi auto. its full auto. he one shots kills us. (i killed that guy and picked his weapon.) So i went 43-12 at end. Im not raging or flaming. overpowered weapons. And the funny thing is that pay2winners say you: ""LOL LOSER CRY MORE LOL NOOB RAGER FLAMER EASY HAHA I NO ENGLISH"""
10934,thnx i steel models oh Review? This game bullshit!

10936,"Uninspired trash to sell to the chinese for a quick buck. Incredibly, also doubles as a budget game for brazillian slum children. This game is just cynicism incarnate, it might as well be called ""give us money please it says counter-strike on it!"""
10937,"Terrible Balance. Zombies Vs Human Infection has the zombies with hella hp, they can regen, have abilities, and walk faster and jump higher than default humans without freemium items. Humans have default weapons from CS 1.6 with addition of a few special freemium weapons you can guy in store. You don't have increased clip sizes, you carry a little bit more ammo but that's negligable compared to the 5k hp you need to bring down per zombie. A Ak47 headshot or m4 headshot will do around 90 - 125 damage and if you land all 30 rounds, the zombie still has 2k left hp."
10938,"I did enjoy this game awhile ago when i didn't care much about ping, now its basically unplayable if you live in australia. I would love to see a oceania server to be released."
10939,"Its almost like the original game ""counter strike 1.6""
But the some popular weapons ak47,Colt feel diferent for some reason.
Gameplay its basicly the same, ""de"" maps are plant & defuse the bomb ""cs"" maps are rescue hotages.
This game have the famous ""zombie plague mod"" but more improved whit awesome tweeks, have aswell many maps to play whit.

I rate this game 7/10. Feels like counter strike 1.6 but whit some diferences whit the new weapons and game mods.
If you like this game i recommend: counter strike ""1.6"" ""Source"" ""Global Offensive"" and Crossfire they are all very similar, crossfire being the most similar because weapon system.

10940,it sucks
10941,.
10942,"They also made combat arms. Great game, btw you should check its reviews."
10943,More like nexon deeze nuts
10944,.
10945,"If my d**k and my A** switched places  however its also made me an athiest, no god not even a terrorist god would make this game a thing and I heard that it took like 5 years to make -F**K you/Im so lucky I got a game for  F***in free"
10946,"This game is so good that it'll take you at least take five seconds until you uninstall it.





Warning: This game may break your soul"
10947,"Free CS game.
Practice in here before getting CS:GO."
10948,"Well, if you like finding empty lobbies, this game is for you."
10949,"Well.. It's free.. So I can't say anything bad.

But it sucks. :("
10950,"This is a completely honest review. The game looks terrible but it's based on an old game so it passes with graphical matters, and gameplay and modes themselves are seriously addictive. I recommend giving this a try if you loved ""infected"" in the halo franchise but do start with the mode ""zombie hero"" to get a feel for the game or you will have trouble otherwise."
10951,"just go buy any real CS game out there and there are tons of mods that 15 year olds make for all of those games that are better then this entire game.

Don't watse your time with this trash."
10952,"this game is very fun and for me is lag free u should get it if u dont want to wast the money on cs go
"
10953,i think reading the terrible reviews is so much more amusing than the game
10954,"at least the unistall button still works, U get ina game u need to spectate 8 fucking mins before doing anything fuck this game complete waste of time just get left for dead 2 if you wanna kill zombies for real dont waste your time with this"
10955,"For what it is, a modded CS 1.6 zombie game that ripped off pieces from all the other good Zombie games out there and devoured their brains, this is freaking AWESOME!

You can tell the devs have put a lot of work into it and have made it an amazing stand alone game. The boss animations are outstanding and the busy servers makes it pretty easy for my son and I to just jump into a game together. 

"
10956,very good
10957,THIS GAME BLOWS.
10958,Daudz labƒÅka par prasto 1.6
10959,it is a fun game but since it updated it just says nexon security and 10 minutes later the game still hasn't loaded
10960,"If you like F.E.A.R Online, this game is for you. 
If you like Counter-Strike, this is not for you. 
-420/69-ign

10961,This game has the worst balance I have ever seen...
10962,NOOOOOOOOO i cant find the uninstall button
10963,"At least i can uninstall 
10/10"

10967,its a game
10968,For no reason
10969,Really fun game to play! Completely makes you ignore the bad graphics and makes you concentrate on the game!
10970,"This game is quite bad, The graphics, sound and the quality are bad, but is addicting, the reason I uninstalled is because it took a toll on my computer, and it has nothing to do with my storage ect..."
10971,10/10 would uninstall again
10972,That cs game is BEST cs but and cs go that game is ok but this game cs nex zomb.. itis best for  me :D sry for bad english i am from serbia :D
10973,THE ONLY BUTTON THAT DOESNT REQUIRE MICROTRANSACTIONS IS THE UNISTALL BUTTON
10974,"My eyes bleed ...
What is my life now ? Who am i after playing game like this ? What will my children think ? Even Satan think that i'm dissapointment of this realm and there is no punishment for my sin . 


Shame on you nexon , SHAME ON YOU . 



"
10975,"bugged...cant run this game....""Error in hack sensor utility"" WTF?"
10976,"Played only 2 hours and it crashed, nice. And what's better, than to show me this msg :This game requires Steam. Wtf am i using then? A fricking a microwave to play it?"
10977,"first impression : ok menu looks bad but whatever

game play - omg these graphics wtf

people - snotty fat little bois

fuck this fuck you"
10978,"Popular sequels* to the original [i]Counter-Strike[/i] in the past have tried to maintain the magic of the original whilst creating their own legacy. Though they gained moderate success in their time (perhaps due to a lack of true competitors) it is only now we have the clarity to see what a farce these 'sequels' were.

[i]Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies[/i] (CSNZ) reinvents the wheel whilst it's predecessors only put new tires on. In a true blend of 'East meets West meets East turned West national' a brilliant game is born. A true step forward for Counter-Strike history. This is comparable to Hideo Kojima's fusion storytelling of Eastern and Western cliches holds a great mirror to it's references and makes for a truly unique experience.

CSNZ is if John Woo met [strike]Resident Evil[/strike] Dawn of the Dead. It's an instant classic and it's only a matter of time before the player base cultivates and redefines eSports.

I give it [b]10 steams.[/b]

10979,Well best game YET I cant play it is says ''You Need Steam To Play This Game'' Well done on making a game that doesnt work 10/10
10980,Great Fun
10981,"[h1] Game service migrated without warning all my stuff is gone [/h1]

Don't buy anything from these people, I lost all my achievements and purchases.

What a mess. I had to look all this up to try and figure out why all my skins and weapons are missing."
10982,Just like COD. I love it and yes I would recommend this to anyone who likes COD.
10983,Bad graphics and bad game
10984,Typical Nexon shilling
10985,This is total shit. Avoid at any cost. Full of crap.
10986,likely enjoy ;)
10987,"Its a good mod for counter strike 1.6 but wished they used counter strike source instead of 1.6.

It be good if it was be able to play on linux!!!"
10988,If you got a counter strike game I recommend you go onto private hosted zombie servers. It is okay for being free though
10989,"I think I gave this game a longer chance than most, but in the end I still can't recommend it. I would be able to look past the graphics if there was balanced gameplay to hold my attention. I could even forgive the limited-time crafted items in the freemium model if there was a reason to use them. Unfortunately, the game is a re-hash of typical FPS game modes without any polish.

I had hope for the couple of unique PVE modes but they were completely unbalanced in favor of the AI. Maybe it was unbalanced because I was playing with only one other friend, maybe it's meant for 4+ players, but I don't find that kind of balancing acceptable. Probably won't come back with more people to try again."
10990,great game
10991,Nice zombie game tray it :)
10992,This is the most cool counter strike
10993,"love it, really good experience for my first counter-strike
"
10994,"Honestly, this is a really boring game. I get that it's based on the original Counter-Strike, and the AI is a little weird and such, but the gamemodes bore me and I really don't think it's that fun. This is yet another example of a bad free-to-play game. Play some Left 4 Dead if you want to shoot the hell out of zombies. I rate this game 2/10."
10995,"I said to myself, this game looks like it came out of 2003 from a bedroom programmer high on weeded crack, but then I realized it came out from a Mature game publisher/developer company that sells thousands of games to millions of people across the world and then proceeded to shiv myself multiple times."
10996,"Great free game!

Games Modes Are pretty fun, and all and all if your looking for a good free game get this one!
"
10997,I rather have a eplaticle seizer while being molested by a sherpa with a hexagon shoved up my a$$ i played as ANALBUMSAX and thats how i felt
10998,I liked it for about 35 min of gameplay its fun it has bad graphics but i dont care a game is about the gameplay and i enjoyed it.
10999,dont play this game...
11000,"Free to play, fun to play!"
11001,"Everything is Counter-Strike 1.6 with the HUD and pay-to-win of a mobile game.

This could be a mod that was made in a couple weeks.

"
11002,"A great game if you are looking for old cs 1.6 zombie action , it has its issues but hey , NOBODY AND NOTHING is perfect right? And is F2P so enjoy it if you like it :)"
11003,"‚úî played the game
‚úî paid for game
‚úî banned in game
‚úî uninstalled"
11004,"Good game,looks like CS 1.6 but more awesome :) I 100% recommend this game"
11005,"Pros: lol are you kidding?

Cons: Can't read teammates names, graphics are scarier then the zombies them selves, counter strike my ass please strike me in the head and kill me, pretty sure every player on right now was just experimenting with the world's greatest gaming developer Nexon.

overall would rate 0.1/10 only would be enjoyable to someone seriously mentally ill."
11006,THIS GAME IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH FUN!! I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYBODY :D
11007,this game is pretty cool as long as you dont mind 2003 graphics but there are some minor flaws in it like how long it takes to earn points but otherwise its really good
11008,"I leveled up by shooting a post.

11/10."
11009,"It's CS 1.6 but with Zombies.. Really fun game :D 

Works on low-end PC's."
11010,"That's extremly strange, but that's looks like ""WolfTeam"", (played many many man.. years ago)
same menu (SAME <<<<<==) 
Let's speaking about this game now =) 
a big fail + another pay2win..."
11011,"Not that great of a series or game.
"
11012,"Good game :D
"
11013,poo

11018,game like kittens O- O
11019,"Even for a free-to-play game it's rather bad.Not so bad ,but bat ."
11020,"nice gamne
"
11021,"Pls just dont, dont install it...."
11022,"Fun game! Quite unstable though.

There are lots of game modes, some remind me of AVP but they all seem to lack of round timer which made the original CS experience. As a free game it's definitely worth checking out.

My first day playing and it's crashed three times (twice clicking on store, once server disconnected).  Several other bugs were annoying too, such as the re-spawn timer being covered by some text about achieving ""First Steps""... The UI has room for improvement as well, I can't find an inventory anywhere of items such as respawn, health, etc."
11023,"IT WONT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"
11024,"Very fun game! A different variety of modes with a bunch of maps, a lot of guns and overall fun gameplay. The graphics in 'my' opinion aren't that bad because honestly, graphics don't really matter to me. One thing that could improve though is buyable weapons in the shop and coded box.
Overall, the rating I would give is 9.5/10"
11025,"Just a remake of Counter Strike: Source, except more crappy, and the Zombie mode is boring"
11026,"Positive:
free cs 1.6 (free game)
varied weapons models

Nagative:
lags when too many zombies
crafting too depandent on luck
items are overprice
hitboxes problem with normal zombie and Deimos ( players are abusing this bug)
too many rude player
kick abuse
female characters only for payment
no awp match but the players use other snipers, awp match but the players use other snipers
some weapons are too overpower like janus 9 in knife match
connection and lag problem
useless ranking system and level
difficult of upgrade bot zombie (700 zombies kills to upgrade from slightly easy to regular...so on)
glitch abuse (eg, in assault, players walk on the sky)

rate: 40/100

sorry for bad english
thank you for reading my review, it base on my 500+ hours gameplay"
11027,Great! :D
11028,"im on a different profile right now but this game is litterally the fricken best. on my other profile ive have cs 1.6, cs condition zero, cs condition zero deleted scenes, cs source, cs nexon zombies and cs global offence and there all great games and i have put many hours into all of them. But all in all i would put cs nexon zombies as my second favorite cs game. reason 1 - you still get that good old feel from cs 1.6, reason 2 - there's so many damn guns to make, reason 3 - more maps, and reason 4 - an actual good level system. I rate this game 9.8/10 and i seriosly recomend this game"
11029,"I played this game for about half an hour and it sucked 100000000000 cocks.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS GIGABYTES ON THIS PIECE OF SHIT, IT IS A TERRIBLE RIPOFF OF SOME SHITTY ASIAN FPS LIKE GunZ OR SOMETHING. FUCK THE PEOPLE THAT MADE THIS, THEY NEED TO DIE."
11030,"you may as well just play the modded servers on the normal counter strike. This ""game"" is just bullshit, they fall into the typical fps f2p where you have to pay to use a gun for a day. it's stupid. I hate f2p like that."
11031,"A SHIT TON of not needed weapons with strange abilities like not ending ammo, 1 hit kill etc.
Also has a very strange track of achivements."
11032,"no
"
11033,take all of the worst parts of counter strike and make it all pay to win with overpriced underdressed anime girl models that look like shit
11034,this game is so bad
11035,"More weapons!
Unless you have money or play those once in a lifetime events, you can't keep them permantly. Also, why are World War II weapons being sold?
Zombies!
Yay, now I can finally use that fire wood to make a camp fire while holding down M1 until I run out of ammo.
Fun Mode!
What is this? Soccer? YOU PUT SOCCER IN A GAME LIKE THIS!? WHY SOCCER!?

Unless you got this game for the Deathmatch only (if this is the case, it is alright), or you like Zombie survival games (the only reason one side loses is A) Humans ran out of ammo or were all reloading, AKA, Humans all die: B) Humans camp in extremely tight areas with one entrance, AKA, Zombies can't get pass), I can't recommend this game."
11036,"Now this game may seem a little old and you may also think it's not that good just because of the graphics.
But this game is pretty cool. Other then the fact that weapons are limited it'f practiacally all fun! You got cool modes
example: The Hidden, Football/soccer (depending where you come from), original (yes this mode is just like playing the original Counter-Strike just so you know), Or even with zombies! There is even a crafting system! You can find gears and blueprints, Gears are used to choose how many days it will last (you dont actually choose, what i mean is that you can have 30 days gears, 2-5 days gears and 1 day gears), You also have blueprints. There are some grades of blueprints noted with a letter on the left, Higher the grade better chance of your craft being made (yes you can fail to craft a weapon if the blueprint has a low grade)

Hope this helped and don't get fooled by my playtime i absolutley love this game!"

11039,pilis counter-strike nexon: zombies
11040,"Really nothing like Counter Strike. Its kind of like 'Death Run' if you've ever played that. Plus, with all the random shit going on now, it makes it an even worse experience."
11041,"The sounds are horrible, the gameplay isn't really that fun, and the game is really unbalanced. Not to mention that the graphics are shit.

4/10"
11042,I like turtles
11043,"This game is an absolute piece of garbage. The pure fact that they'd dare touch even an outdated unsused engine by Valve, the creators of the Counter-Strike franchise is utterly astounding. Nexon is known for it's breed of gamebreaking bugs and terrible games all around.

This game is made on gold source, or gold syrce, however it's spelled. The engine that was used to create the original Team Fortress, Half Life 1, Richochet, the original death match, and Counter Strike and Counter Strike Condition Zero. In theory, this engine is incredibly outdated, but it's still an incredibly powerful, durable engine. I like the engine myself, but I hate this product. CS:NZ is CS 1.6 with a mod. I don't know why they'd release an entire fucking standalone game over a mod, but it's flabbergasting.

CS:NZ is what I can describe it as, an utter horrendous piece of garbage CS 1.6 mod that somehow became a standalone game. Basically, this entire 'mod' or game, whatever you wish to call it, is this:

Zombies! Zombies! Not enough games about zombies yet? Yeah, there is.

Guns! Too many guns! All of them are unbalanced!

Classic Mode! Why would you integrate the original CS 1.6 Matchmaking if you're not going to balance out your weapons for the game mode in the first place? 

All in all I hate this game. Don't support the developers, don't get this game, I only play it for classic mode."
11044,I really enjoy this game and have been hooked since I started. I don't enjoy the zombie modes much but I like the original and team deathmatch modes. Although the graphics aren't like cs:go they are pretty good for a f2p play game. Overall it's a great game.
11045,Rwealy God game and intresting :D
11046,"Its a decent game but the modes is way too repetitive. Some of the maps has too little places for humans to hide from the zombies. 

I believe that the game needs better weapons, equipment for the humans. Make the zombies walk much slower. There are a lot of  stuff Valve needs to fix to make the game fun to play. But I think there is a lot of potential in this game, and if Valve are able to make the most of that potential Nexon: Zombies could be a very fun game to play. But until they do so Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies gets a NO from me."
11047,Not even worth playing 1/10
11048,goodgame.
11049,Very good game !

11053,"A piece of dog sh*t with buttons is better than this.

Piece of dog sh*t vs Counterstrike Nexon zombies.

Dog sh*t:
-Free
-No microtransactions needed
-Less buggy than CS:NZ (Although sometimes buggy)
-Is fun (ny)
-You get straight into it
-Your friends will laugh also when they find out you've been playing with it
-No computer needed to play
-Mulitplayer with friends
-Singleplayer
-You can play for a long time (until it rains or turns white)

CS:NZ
-Is free also
-Game is littered with microstransactions
-Buggy
-Complicated for new users
-Servers are buggy

11057,"1. Visually looks bad.
-This includes awful animation, textues and the models. Dear god, the models.

2. The game RUNS poorly. It's badly optimized or locked at a low FPS, perhaps. But on the rig I have, there's no reason for this to be the case.

3. The music is awful and the sound quality is barely passable. 
-Also, the main menu music carries on into the game, and it doesn't fit whatsoever.


Try it if you want, since it's free. But don't expect much. And please don't put any money into it."
11058,"I'll make this short.

1. Visually looks bad.
      -This includes awful animation, textues and the models. Dear god, the models.

2. The game RUNS poorly. It's badly optimized or locked at a low FPS, perhaps. But on the rig I have, there's no reason for this to be the case.

3. The music is awful and the sound quality is barely passable. 
      -Also, the main menu music carries on into the game, and it doesn't fit whatsoever.

11059,"At first you would think that this game is crap, but when you actually play it, its loads of FUN !!!!!"
11060,"The zombies in this game to be a lot more challenging unlike CS Portable with all there mods that they can do it, the only problem with this game is that zombies are normally protraited as slow, but I like the whole survival aspect of this game."
11061,"Lots of fun playing the original version instead of the zombies. Altho the variety of zombie modes does keep you busy, it's just missing something. The ability to play regular matches and deathmatches of 1.6 is really where the fun is. Wish more people played."
11062,"Let's just say this new CS players, of course this isn't going to be normal CS. 
Also, this game is fun for a F2P game, lots of fun with or without friends."
11063,"It's Counter Strike...

...with zombies!!

what more can i say?"
11064,"I killed my friend with a snowman that had a bomb strapped to it.
I shot my friends leg and got a head shot.
I shot a wall and got a headshot on my friend.
I fell 2 feet and died.
I played soccor with my friend.
I used a nuclear bomb and killed my friend.
I played on a map with over sized objects.

11065,yes totally worth my time 50/10. game full of assholes that love to troll and corner u in a section of map let u die. other the that it was an A-ok game just play with people u know becuase otherwise ur team will let u die.
11066,REALLY FUN!! IF YOU DONT HAVE ANY MONEY THIS IS A GREAT SHOOTER!! RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!             SIGNING OFF
11067,Hours of fun fps gaming with unlimited amounts of zombies. What more can you ask for?
11068,pay da money and become close with gms or join their clan. you can ddos to your heart's content :dddd
11069,"Outdated Engine, Bad graphics quality but it¬¥s fun and a good Co-Op and versus zombie game and another thing that makes this game recommended  is that this game got many different game modes that you¬¥ll enjoy playing with friends or random players.
Almost CS 1.6 + zombies (+more game modes/maps) 
weak 6.5/10"
11070,"Plays just like all the other free to play FPS games out there, offers nothing new, really. That, and it's Nexon."

11078,"I give this game a 10/10

Pros:
- Gives you old counter strike feel
- It's free
- theres zombies
- Doesnt require too much from your computer, anyone can play

Cons:
- made by nexon
"
11079,Just buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive
11080,it is sure are nice that developers give away this thing for free but... it doesn't worth more than 12 hours tbh.
11081,"It's basically free cs 1.6 with zombies, but no one gives a flying fck about dem zombies. Everyone just plays original de_dust2. There's also a lot of new weapons and skins comparing to 1.6. So if you liked 1.6, give CSN:Z a try. 

Ps. Beware of cheating Russians. They are everywhere and this game doesn't make exception."
11082,cool
11083,"Its a bad game do NOT get it



"
11084,"The graphics were smooth running but simple. Reminded me of team fortress somehow. I felt bad when my avatar turned into zombie and I went after some girl. It was creepy. The humans dont have much chance it seems. The women should be able to fight back, they had no weapons. I would recommend if the humans had more chance and weapons esp. the women."
11085,"EDIT Dec. 2017: This game seems to have changed drastically and looks like a pile of shit, so proceed with caution. Everything I said here probably no longer applies.

Now you're thinking: ""Nexon? Zombies? Free Counter-Strike? Awful.""
And I guarantee to you that this game isn't what you're thinking, so please hear this review out.
The asthetic of the game is obviously not appealing, it's rather generic and downright awful, but if you actually check the game out, you'd find that it's literally just Counter-Strike 1.6 with a lot of unneeded crap. Whether or not you like this unneeded crap is up to you. If you don't want this unneeded crap, you can get rid of it. Here's a console command to remove the costumes from your view: ""cl_minmodels 1"". No quotations. All the characters will stay as classic Counter-Strike. There are also new weapons added into the game, they're not overpowered and are perfectly balanced. If you don't want them, simply join a classic game. Host a game and set weapons to ""Classic Only"". You can also change the HUD so you won't see ""x KILL"" or the score counter. With these options, you pretty much got yourself classic Counter-Strike 1.6 for free!

That being said, the rest of the game isn't very good. The ranking system is pointless and extremely time-wasting. The crafting system is random albiet not terrible. The UI is hard to get used to and very clunky. The game is sometimes a b*tch to get launched but not for everyone. The only good game modes are Gun Game, Team Deathmatch, and Classic, although I have a guilty pleasure for ""Item Battle"" in FUN mode. The Scenario modes are attrocious with braindead A.I., hitscan enemy accuracy, barriers that take way to long to destroy in order to progress, and horrendously long and generic boss fights. The cosmetics and costumization is abysmal and are beyond awful. So this whole game isn't perfect, by any means.

Although, I can't help but reccomend this because of the fact that this has the classic Counter-Strike package, along with other features you may even like. Most people on Steam have Counter-Strike but for those who don't, this is the perfect substitute."
11086,"A very good game.

Graphics:
~ Weapons, and Player models are a little tensty but could be better.
~ Maps, Very good for a game close to CSS.
~Sky-Shaders Didnt see much shaders but the sky is beautiful.

Weapon and Weapon Sounds
~ Realistic weapon sounds unless compard to CSGO
~ Models are good, just need a bit more detail/texture

Shop and Shop Prices
~ Very Simple and easy to use layout
~ Pretty Low and good (but you have to plan fast for what you want before round starts)

Online match Finding
~ Very Very Easy to find matches

Other Players
~ 95% of the time they are friendly
~50% will follow your plan/strats

Match Length
~ A lot of the time they can be dragged on
~ Some/most (depends on which mode) are short


Overall I rank this game as a 89 very fun for a free First Person Shooter."
11087,pretty great i remember playing this in css and i had tons of fun now its free for all and its great i recommend to any cs go fans and zombie fans
11088,"Good for competitive, but not for Zombies."
11089,"It's not worth it because it's boring and the gameplay is really rough. The only good thing is that you get to play CS 1.6 for free.
"
11090,"because
"
11091,"Pros:
-Good graphics
-Easy controls

Cons:
-Guns can shove a zombie back....ALWAYS! Great if you're a survivor, bad for the player zombie making it unplayable.
-Matches are too short
-Needs less camping spots. I.E, crates to climb, etc.

5/10"
11092,"I would say this game is so so, concerning some problems.
1: The graphics are horrible, I'd expect to see at least some CS: Global Offensive graphics
2: Although the game is quite enjoyable at some times, the micro-transactions ruins it.
3: This game fails to deliver the so called ""Massive Multiplayer""."
11093,"Its ok. Its pretty much old CS with zombies. Its free, just try it.

Pros:  +a free version of CS (idk which versoin)
        
          + zombie modes
  
          
Cons:  - needs a 3rd party account"
11094,"Great game, lots of different type of gameplays, co-op, DM, Team-DM, etc.. All for free!"
11095,Fun
11096,It's fun when u have good guns
11097,biggest pile of shait i  ever seen .. no really .. imagine cs 1.6 with shitty zombie sounds.
11098,"Crashes everyime u join a server, gg.
"
11099,"it is a very fun game to play with friends i definetley recommned this game if you are a person who likes to play with other people. ^ ^
"
11100,Counter-Strike Fakeson: Shit in other words its a pile of fucking shit!
11101,"Counterstike 1.6 for free, plus okay zombie mode."
11102,The zombies will be back.
11103,"To be honest , this game is not the most successful of the series of games Counter-Strike , because all these novelties as : football mode , zombie mode , joint missions , changed cards , and so forth, not very pleased , rather upset . So this game has failed in a series of Counter-Strike , the game is simply connected with the game Cross Fire and got Counter-Strike : Nexon Zombies ! To be honest the game on the fan , I did not like it , another free game for kids which love to moisten our all sorts of zombies and so on ,so you decide to play it or not!"
11104,take out your frustrations with a gun lol. Great game play with other players on line and shoot them all lol.
11105,thr be a gud gamemode in this butt thats its I lik the survival part but evry thang els suxs 3/10
11106,"Although this game is free-to-play, I think you are better off buying CSGO and playing on a zombie server."
11107,This game has horrible graphics and sucks ass
11108,"What the hell are you doing in the good reviews?
Uninstall it now!"
11109,"It took a decent amount to download and when I went to install it, it had a few hiccups when it started.

The game has quite a bit of bugs to be fixed but if you like playing zombie games and miss the basic graphics of Doom, enjoy.  I'll carry on..."
11110,like
11111,"its nice but the graphics and things are kimd of weird i wish there were skins like in CS GO :)))))))))))))
"
11112,ew
11113,"Very fun game in my opinion. Does not deserve the hate it gets. Sure the game doesnt have great quality but it has very fun gamemodes. Especially the hunt (or whatever) gamemode when one player is slightly visable and everyone has to try to kill him, I could play it for hours(this is in the gamemode labeled fun). The crafting is a great idea but i dont like how what you craft you can only use for a limited time. Over all a pretty fun game to play with your friends. It's worth getting. ;)"
11114,"god help us all
"
11115,"i use to hate this game because the zombies are sooo op. but now the new update made the humans better. 

          GRAPHICS SUCK BUT FUN GAME."
11116,"i have played this game once and could tell immediately that it is a piece of poop.
there is no learning curve, you are just expected to know everything already.
i dont understand a thing about joining games and selecting weapons etc.
i suspect that with the original cs's popularity the developpers of this game just expect everybody to know how this all works. but not everybody wants to, has to or actually has played the original.
a bit of a tutorial might exist but good luck trying to find one because there is no such thing as a conventional main menu or anything like it. a waste of disc space and time. dont play this."
11117,"I have played this game for a while now and I'm quite enjoying it. But this game is really broken and needs alot of improvements. If you don't like frustration, I suggest not to click the Play game button.

Positive: 
Loads of game modes
Loads of weapons
Level system
Families (Pretty much like clans with some advantages)
Items in the store are cheap (scaling from 0.49‚Ç¨ to 1.99‚Ç¨)


Negative:
No tutorial whatsoever (Played for 150 hours, still not sure how some things work)
Seriously difficult achievements
Lots and lots and lots and lots of little negative annoying defects
Only 3-4 considerable weapons for bossing
Most of the weapons crafted will last for a fixed amount of time



*My review now, almost a month later*
If this game was under some other developer, it would be amazing. Nexon yet somehow manages to slowly make you disgust their games.
At first CSN: Z is a great game but the more you play it, the worse it gets. At some point you just find yourself playing the same maps and same modes all over again without anything changing. 
The game is updated only once a month. And no, it is not a big update. Last update we got 3 new weapons, some new zombies and a stupid luck based event.

This game is going nowhere and it's just slowly dying.

That's pretty much it, I hope it helped you decide whether you want to play the game or not."
11118,"when i saw the trailer it got me pumped up so i got it when i started playing
the game doesnt teach you how to play everything is confusing its pay 2 win and it throws you right in there i think its a bad game sorry and graphics are a huge joke"
11119,"Story time
-Has potaoe pc 
- Only game i don't lag in is this game
- Gets new pc 
- plays csgo
- joins this game
- plays csgo
-dosent join this game again."
11120,gg
11121,this game only needs deathrun
11122,"OK. You think: CS and zombies, something better? But the real question  when you play it is: something worse?"
11123,"Game is awesome , and there is no P2W (Pay to win) Items are craftable it's so awesome i play it and make my friends play , really cool game with 1.6 cs graphics , but still enjoyable and fun. 10/10"
11124,Meh.
11125,"Didn't even get a chance to play. Game wouldn't even connect to the server. ""Re-connecting..."""
11126,"Sucks, cant even join servers"
11127,Pretty good game if you want to kill yourself
11128,"It's a free to play game, so you have to expect typical f2p shenanigans, but overall it can be pretty fun if you don't take it too seriously. I don't see any point in playing anything other than zombie scenario, though. Balance in all the other modes is awful. Also if you want to play zombie mode, the one for cs 1.6 / cz is much better, and has lots of customization. The game is worth a try, since it's free anyway. Don't bother with the modes other than Zombie Scenario, though, and the only good zombie scenario maps are Lost City, Double Gate, Trap, Last Clue, Chaos, and Contact, the others are just okay. I havent played zombie scenario 4 and 5 yet though, since they're not in this region yet, so who knows about those."
11129,made my comp crash....every time
11130,"pretty lame, i had greater expectations"
11131,"i love it.. but since you cant buy weapons from the store with points makes it hard...
the other version called ""counter strike online"" that was launched in singapore.. was a little better,weapons were available on the shop.
keep the game updated please.."
11132,Anyone who can play this game for more than 2 seconds without wanting to bleach their eyes out is a god.
11133,"Nice f2p CS 
I really enjoy it !"
11134,Awesome game but graphics are bad but I can't really complain since it's free. 7/10
11135,"This game is free to play (unlike other nexon games), you can aquire all the weapons by just playing the game (in game drop items) but it's 10x if not more faster just to spend real world cash. Keep in mind that all extra/new characters are cash only.

This game is fun for those who likes zombie games but if you are more into player vs player(regular gun play), I would recommend you CS:GO instead. Overall, this game is worth a try."
11136,"Possily worst 7 minutes of my life, not sure if its worse than the 9 minutes i spent in Dota 2.."
11137,game stops responding when it loads... 0 /10
11138,"Basically 2 games in one :) if you want to play counterstrike go ahead! if you want to play zombies, Go ahead! ps Great Fun With Friends"
11139,"This is Counter Strike 1.6 with Zombie Mod , mods like  mode for cs 1.6 zombie plague advance ahhahahahahha  and is free CS what do you want more  : ) Have FUN"
11140,"I will keep this review super short. There is four facts you need to know.

1. It has pretty much all the features of normal cs 1.6, there is normal gameplay (Without any new weapons or balance, all th same as in old cs), gungames etc, only thing it doesn't have as far as I know is some rare custom maps and kz maps.

2. It's free.

3. You can actually make servers with no hassle, and the ranking system is much better and wider.

4. You can play a whole ton of other things other then the ones you're used to in cs with new weapons etc that fit into the cs atmosphere extremely well if you ask me.

What else do you need to know to get this? It's pretty much free improved CS 1.6 plus other things, duh!!! 

Free original + improved CS 1.6? Automatic 10/10."
11141,The best part: Uninstalling.
11142,"Ok this game is amazing. you may think ""oh counterstrike from 2001 or so it sucks!"". But let me stop you right there! This game has exceeded my expectations. Its not the original counterstrike. its way better! If your computer isnt that amazing but you love counterstrike and shooter games that dont lag. Well then this is your game. You can craft guns with blueprints in this game. And there are different guns added to the game. Every day or so you receive a daily bonus and a free weapon and booster i should say. Then you customize your classes and try out your new gun. One downside is that if you dont go on every day your progress will be lost but thats just the daily bonus not your overall stats and weapons. I would absolutely recommend you try this game out. 
"
11143,This is more terrible than even 1.5
11144,i dont like :(
11145,"This is so baaaaaaaaaaaad, go play CS 1.6 instead of this shit"
11146,NO
11147,Well guys this is time to kick some a** of zombies lets join the team
11148,I think this is a crappy version of Combat Arms Quarantine Regen mode. Ôªø
11149,okay
11150,Fun but laggy sometimes
11151,this was the first counterstrike i played and i thought it was a good ass game until i bought source and boy did i know what i was getting into   so a few months later i bought cs go and damn now that i think about it this shit is gay as fuck. thats my personal experience but seriously though in order to know its bad or not u would have to play one o the counterstrikes besides this one and then u  will see why this is a  dumb ass fucking blind inbred peice of shit <-----------------------there i got straight to the point
11152,"what the hell did i just played? I mean the game is fun, is trying to be a first person shooter mmo and the idea they wanted to make here is not bad, the graphics are as bad as they were in the original counter strike (half life counter strike), but how these guys developed this is not as good as it sounds. I recommend you watch a review of this game on youtube because if say everything bad on this game, i would probably be here forever. I give it a 4/10. Great concept, bad game"
11153,best game since tetris
11154,"It's alright I guess, fun zombie modes. Good for a completely free game. Solid 6.5 out of 10."
11155,the game is fun. the only thing i hate is the zombie part of the game its just bad if your planing in giting this game just play it for the death mach and other modes beside the zombie mode
11156,"It wasnt bad plating this but between the ridiculous amout of ammo used to destroy barriers and the glitchy zombies while you try to move away, that really made me stop playing otherwise it was great with all the customization options."
11157,Nope.... Terrible....
11158,its an awesome game to play with freinds or when your bored it doesnt matter i love playing against others in death matches and the more you play the better it gets because theres so many suprises and so little time!!! GL HF :D
11159,dunno what to to say about it! 6/10
11160,Well that was fucking dreadful
11161,"To be honest, you're better off leaving this page and just pretend you never came here."
11162,A stain on my harddrive
11163,shit game nothin special
11164,not bad.I like this game.
11165,This game is one of the best game i have played
11166,"a message keeps coming up saying hack sensor is not defined

11167,"Thinking of buying csgo?

This is the game for you!!!"
11168,"Very... Very bad.

11170,Mine says it requires steam to work
11171,I must say its a very good game

11177,nice gameplay
11178,Nice game... (y) ;)
11179,its pretty good i dont like the limited time characters and real money purchases they can just leave them there. overall its a good game
11180,"when i played it, there were no zombies , its was just an old version counter strike"
11181,Perfect Game :D i like it very much
11182,"This is acutally a really fun game. At first it seemed shitty with the different gamemodes and so on. I started out by playing the different zombie games which didn't really fit me, then I discovered the ""Original"" gamemode which I really liked. I usually only play the other gamemodes if a quest requiers me to do so."
11183,"One of the most unprofessinaly designed games I have ever seen. Zombies have ludicrus amounts of health, get stoped in their tracks when shot and when 5 of the soldiers camped out of bounds are all shooting at you... well... it's not somthing I would pay real money for. Sound 3/10 = Grading Grpahics Null becuase they dont matter. Gameplay 5/10 Mouse feels laggy and is just bland. The Only reason this game is free2play is becuase it would never survive as a priced game. 3/10"
11184,"Well, its a very good game where you can kill waves and waves and waves of zombies with freinds or you can just KILL your freinds in a gamemode. the graphics are bad but have that quake 2 graphics charm....and also you can make you own server to play with freinds alone, nbp, nbp."
11185,"I would only recommend this game is you don't own  any Counter-Strike game.
Zombies kill with one hit in almost every game mode, and move faster then humans so it completly unbalanced.
The fortification mode was intresting, for the first couple of days, the crafting never worked even when the required materials were prestnt, and the  5th day titan never lost any health.
I'm not a big stickler with graphics, but this is steam and you're using Counter-Strike as the foundamentals for your game, when source engion is free.
There's also a store where you can spend 9 bucks to play as a women, 9 more if you want one on each team. The rest of the store have options that'll go away after 30 or 15 days. I don't know if they're just skins or pay to win. 
Like said only get this game if you want a Counter-Strike game and don't want to buy your first, and/or never played a zombie game EVER."

11199,"The game is fun and enjoyable, however, the bugs let it down, levelling up displays that you are 1 level higher, crafting is based on luck and enhancing weapons is frustrating, i used 30k points for 30 enhancements, i tried enhancing the M2, i used 10 enhancements and not only did i fail to enhance 6 times, i succeeded twice and and got a level decrease twice, so in actual fact i spent money on point, used those points to enhance a weapon and ended up with no enhancements at the end of it, Nexon are clearly driven by money with this game and it makes the game a complete let down, it has potential, but unfortunately Nexon have tried thier hardest to destroy the potential!!"

11214,I instal game...And i start game...And game stop...Help please...
11215,Nice game!
11216,Love the weapons and Characters also Gamemodes because I mostly like to play Half Life 1 mods
11217,noice
11218,OH MY GOD THE LITTLE YELLOW SPRAYS ON THE FLOOR. THEY'RE SO GREAT.  SO FANCY YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW. 20/10 BEST GAME EXPERIENCE I EVAH HAD.

11224,When you don't have cs go you need to play cs 1.6 then it appears this with new weapons and characters and zombies so this game is not worth it it's 5/10

11226,"After 12 hours of playing Counter Strike Nexon: ZOMBIES, Im glad I have finished at least 12 hours of the game. Its the used toilet paper scraps of previous Counter Strikes, Blocky graphics, practically mindless zombie setups, and much much more. However the game is a F2P, offers several game modes including the classics of team Deathmatch and Original. The zombie counter part of the game is okay. However the P2W weapons are ALWAYS dominating on the field. Personally i dont like it but it is for those who want a varient of CS. Rating 5.5/10 meh."
11227,eben :^D
11228,–Ω–æ—Ä–º
11229,"Better modes than normal CS 1.6 
+ Zombie/Human scenarios 
+ Craftable weapons"
11230,"this game....hhhhhmmmmmm..........
I'll be honest I haven't played any other counter strike games(though I'll probably get CS:GO through crafting gems on the 15th), so I'm going off my impression of this game, not any others in comparison.

the basic counter-strike gamemodes(original,deathmatch,etc.) I thought were a lot of fun(despite the fact that I suck at them) however, the zombie gamemodes felt really mediocre, not very thought out.

thats....about it. I mean, the items shop wasn't working at all for me, but that was about it.
I mean, at that rate, I might as well just get CS:GO. I'll probs only have this game for a pretty short time.

5/10"
11231,ok this game is actually good.. for a free to play...
11232,"yaayayayayyayayayayyayayayayayyayayayyayayayyayayay
"
11233,Good game.
11234,Its good but the wepons should be a little hight damage becose they are not doing something but the game is cool and I recommend this to play !!
11235,i like this game nothing much to say it's just cool
11236,nice
11237,Sweet Beanz
11238,When the fucc did this become f2p minecraft ????
11239,CS in China is depressing/fun depending on what type of shitty crack made you think downloading it was a good idea
11240,You should get paid for playing this game.
11241,I love this game alot
11242,:D
11243,suck my ass computer games trolololol xbox broken
11244,"it says i need to download steam even though im already on it 2/5
"
11245,Hit detection can be just as buggy as CoD which scores a perfect 13472164738/10. Only downside is there's too much .8--water. 7.8/10.
11246,"Great FPS with fun content. Great version of Counter Strike, some weapons may be a bit op, but very fun zombies and allowing us to play Original. Also I have yet to see a single crying fetus baby (underaged player) Mic-Spamming
85/100 Graphics
85/100 Sound
98/100 Gameplay
100/100 Replay Value (Its an FPS you kinda have to replay it A LOT)
95/100 Customization
The old counter strike graphics allow it to play on older computers better, I just don't like how I can't make it play on my screens resolution Great FPS, sometimes the sounds are annoying
"" The zombies will be back ""
"" We have been enslaved by the zombies ""
ECT,ECT
Also the menu is a tad bit confusing for a newbie, but don't be turned away!"
11247,ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I EVERED PLAY!!!!!!!!!!!
11248,nice
11249,Great game feels alot like 1.6 but its FREE and its got zombies if you love counter strike or haven't tried one yet you should try it after all it is FREE!!
11250,"Well, Personally i think this game was bad but know i geuss they kinda fixed some stuff :3
I mean i like it's good so you shoud try this game. 

P.S - Don't look at the negative reviews :3 pls"
11251,very cool game almost no lag only when loading the map it lags a bit but its a cool game fun to play and free i recommend this game
11252,"Nice version of Counter Strike, but  you get what you pay for, the graphics aren't the best and there are many ""OP"" guns, but overall a good game"
11253,"I can see myself putting tons of more hours to craft tons of guns and aim to get permanent guns, doing survival modes and zombie scenarios especially!!"
11254,"It's like Counter-Strike, but with zombies and not fun."
11255,.
11256,nice
11257,"I can't really complain on how unbalanced this game can be, it really has changed before it was released on Steam, I didnt really had hours spent on this game, but it was something I wouldnt recommend. But i changed my mind after a few things they made this alot better:

Zombies: Pretty much what the other reviewers say, Players only win if the zombies are noobs, and playing Zombies is really pointess.. Trust me it really is.

Old patch before Steam: What the problem was, at first you got your classic weapns, and thought. the new weapons would be just pay to use it right? Nope.avi! you had to litteratly buy the original guns too, and why?! it was obviously a P2W kind of game that pretty much are money grabbers, I really wouldnt blame people not wanting to play Counter-Strike Online 2 cause it's the same company and will probably pull the same bullshit.

Overall: It's not that the game got any better, But it deffiently improved. It's really playable now And it's not laggy anymore, If you enjoy Counter-Strike and like zombies? This is for you.

It's pretty much Counter-Strike: Condition Zero (Free To Play Edition)

Would I play it again? Hell yeah
Would I play it daily? No, I got other games to play besides this.
Would I recommend it? Yes."
11258,"i just love this game i play it all the time i play the surive mode the most lol
"
11259,not really that fun
11260,Unistall Simulator
11261,"This game is amazing! It is almost everything you would want out of a counter strike game, but add zombies. One of the only downsides is that the graphics aren't amazing."
11262,I could of bought a nice place to live had a nice girlfriend a future but instead im here playing Nexon Zombies please bank account forgive me.
11263,"Every oldschool cs 1.6 player must love this game. Its not pay to win at all. Lovely remake with mods, tons of new guns and no hackers so far."
11264,"When I was playing I never felt that this is awesome
Cons:
[olist]
This is basically just a 1.6 with a Zombie mod
The weapon crafting is [b] useless [/b]
The clan system is retarded
Not that fun to play
Zombies that are controlled by players are not at all easy to kill, sometimes even [u] impossible [/u] to kill
[/olist]
Pros:
-None really, except from the feeling of getting to kill zombies
-The joy of getting a player controlled zombie killed"
11265,it's a horrible mod for css.
11266,Haven't played CS since highschool. Downloaded this soon as I saw it. I've put a few hours in so far - I've enjoyed it quite a bit.  I like that the original format is included - nice touch. Would recommend to CS fans.
11267,"Good game, quite enjoyable"
11268,"I've playing over a hundred hours, spend some money, given it more than a fair try. I have yet to craft a permanent weapon. I spent $35.00 in durables and blueprints and I feel that i got totally burned. Also feels like the higher in level I get, the worse my odds of successfully crafting, enhancing, and sythesizing are getting worse. Enhanced weapons level down is a total burn. I'm someone infuriated at this. I spent money and got far more fails than successes. If you are new to this game, then save your money. Not worth it. Build on an age old engine, i expected to get far more for my money. Feels like Nexon is sucking up all my money, and not giving me anything in return. DON'T SPEND ANY MONEY! IT'S A TRAP! :-0"
11269,"Watch the game trailer and run the game once. Not even close to what it wants to be. Just awful. In china they already have nexon 2...., that version is much better btw"
11270,this is fucking good game
11271,this is fucking good game
11272,Fun to play
11273,very cool game
11274,"It is a very decent game. It has very good and fun gameplay with the zombies and all, it is fun and the crafting system isn't bad  I just wish it were somewhat easier to understand. Overall a very positive experience!"
11275,"I  LOVE  IT
PLAY  IT
"
11276,if you played the original CS 1.6 you'll love this game. i mean you might have to pay money for blueprints which i did twice and got good guns but you dont have to buy them. they have events that give you the prints and guns. the zombie mode is outstanding with the guns you make. idk why this has mixed reviews but oh well. graphics need an update though :)
11277,"So a lot of people are bashing this for being pay2win. But if you actually put the effort into the game you can unlock some cool sh!t.  I'm still a little confused on why your crafted weapons are limited but that gives me an excuse you change things up. Apart from a few crashes I've had no other problems with this game, so I do recommend you give it a go, if you don't like it, fair enough and move on."
11278,Dafuq did i just played ?
11279,Screw this game.
11280,"Okay, okay, this is a good game. I want to get global Offensive. So if my PC can run this game can I run global offensive?"
11281,Me personally i still have hatred towards nexon for most of their games but this i'd have to say is probably the best improvement. Sure counter strike helped out but all in all the game modes are fun and does live upto the name. so i'd say it's worth a try.
11282," 3 friends and i downloaded this to play together. We get into a lobby after struggleing to understand the UI, then when we finally got into a game, we played for ~2 minutes and we all agreed it was horrible and left. Will never play again. 1/10"
11283,It's a nice game. I like it.
11284,"It's just a better version of Counter Strike 1.6, so who plays 1.6 should really play this..."
11285,"This is awesome (It's good for you newbies too)! Plus it has new weapons! Not only you can buy 'em, you can craft 'em! Enjoy your life with CSN:Z!"
11286,BEST SHOOTER
11287,"2gB game that is a remake of a cs mod but with grapics that are worse than 1.6 (really 2gigs for that?) and with micro transactions.

edit-micro transactions doesnt have to mean its pay 2 win, in this case its more like 'pay to use all these features if your to lazy to grind for gun and item drops'...and alot of items seem to have limited time use, which makes poeple more likely to just buy what they want then to play for hours to get it. it really seams like a good game but for 2gB and to have graphics predateing 1.6 and (even worse) condition zero. the game's idea of a cs zombie is great, but it just seems like this was just a cash grab job from a 3rd party to make money off of the cs legacey"
11288,Best Game ever <3
11289,"It's like Counter Strike 1.6, but It's horrible because it isn't counter strike 1.6."
11290,this game has shit written all over it
11291,not bad lol not too shabby
11292,"One of the best free to plays on the market, provides hours of play. I think if it was brought into the Steam Workshop it would be evem better because of the countless choices people can erect."
11293,terrible
11294,needs a lot of work
11295,Dudes this game is awesome but do not be afrade to play you can play wait everybody but the zombies or not that bad
11296,How do you buy the Weapon Package Grade-1???
11297,"crazy b******* runing aroud the map with no panties


                                                                                                                panties/10"
11298,"Amazing imo, I like all the zombie gamemodes and I like how you can play it without it demanding a graphics card. Nice and simple."
11299,"So, CS Nexon isnt a bad game in my opion. Its fun and time consuming. I really enjoy the game and the feel of it. It keeps the teamwork expirence fresh and fun. Another great thing is you CAN play it on lower end pc's. I can play with this game with my rendering pc that has a 1.4GHz dual core AMD proc with a radeon HD 7310 graphics. not a bad game and recomend it to many friends!"
11300,"The reason this is a free to play, is because Nexon couldn't charge people for a copy of cs 1.6 ."
11301,"Counter-Strike = Fantastic
Zombies = Amazing

Counter-Strike + Zombies = FREAKING GENIUS!!!"
11302,"Very fun game, proably one of the most fun games I have in my collection it's very easy to run but the art work is still very good. The multiplayer is amazing always meeting new people, it's easy to make your own server with you firends, the amount of games you can play are almost unlimted by the time you even get tired of one game mode you'll have 20 hours on the game, now although the multiplayer is good, it's still fun even if you're playing by yourself providing, proably my favoirte game mode bot zombies. With or without firends it's fun, the download time is only around 2 hours and I have a pretty bad laptop so that's really saying something, if you're new to the PC gaming like I am and you enjoy games like call of duty zombies or just zombie games at all, this is the perfect game for you. But like most games it has it has it down side, the bots talk A LOT and if you use skype like I do it kinda gets annoying, and also every now and again it has it's lag spikes, like every game. Over all rating 8.5/10 -Good game mode -Addicting -Good graphics for its time"
11303,Great as an uninstall simulator!
11304,"I love this game but they should add some guns in the shop Blue prints get boring sometimes u know?
 Nexon pleas come up with something good Its perfect game though..."
11305,Why the fuck does this game even exist?
11306,Nice Game
11307,Bad Game
11308,just a free game for 3 to 10 hours to play..yea..i have about 90 hrs..
11309,No... Just no....
11310,"I recommend Counter Strike I do NOT recommend the zombie mod.
Its soooooo BORING!!!!!!! Just shoot zombies that have 50000 hp and nothing else."
11311,this game is acctually pretty cool when your bored lol
11312,"THIS GAME ALMOST SCREWED MY PC OVER!
The game itself is alright.... It does have many balancing issues. For an online game that's supposed the run from 2014 onwards, the graphics are HORRENDOUS! Has a nice variety of guns you can use. The zombies are also varied as well. It's possible to have fun with it. That's about all I can say about it. I didn't have much experience with it.
Now for the game almost killing my pc part. See that 1.6 hours on my playtime? That is a dirty lie. It runs even when you are not playing it. You also can not get back on the game because of this. I had to log out of my computer profile to close it. When I got back on, it said it cannot find my profile and switched me to an older Windows OS! (I think it was 98 or XP) I then restarted my entire computer and thankfully everything is safe. UNINSTALLED INSTANTLY OUT OF FEAR!
I don't know if this will happen to you but if you really want to play this game, make sure you read the end-user agreement word for word very carefully. I'm pretty sure they are doing some weird crap to my pc right now. 
I cannot recommend this after what I just experience. I also cannot recommend this because the game is not that good at all. Play at your own risk."
11313,i love you game.
11314,Great game
11315,"I used to think this game was fun as a kid, But seeing it now is the future, you're better off buying CSS or CS:GO than buying in-game items. you'll have more fun playing CSS or CS:GO than this game."
11316,No
11317,"Dont listen to what every one else says this game is fun! Sure it is hard to grasp at first, but at its core its a good game. Just give it a shot its free so what is the loss on it? Just try it!"
11318,"Good bye CSonline , you was awesome but no more ..."
11319,I like it because its free
11320,"Cool game, reminds me of the old CS 1.6 and the guns added from Nexon's game Combat arms, such as the mtar and trg just makes it 10x better. GG welp"
11321,Addicting!
11322,It's a massive pill of crap that I couldn't stop laughing at when playing. Do yourself a favor and get a group of freinds to download this so you and them can all get drunk and get enjoyment out of just how bad this pill from nexon truely is.
11323,good game :p :v <3
11324,after getting a new mouse i'm not sure why people don't like this game
11325,"this screamed creativity in my left ear, sarcasm isn't real

10/10 would bang"
11326,no i do not recommend this game because it has very little graphics terrible game play no campain or anything fun.
11327,It is a realy fun if you like cod or zed games!
11328,Great Game
11329,"its not a good game, the crafting doesnt make any sense and the game itself is really buggy and disgusting. It also has a great Korean P2W system and fags that buy a reskin to become a woman. The only good thing is that you can play an old version of CS for free, but that isnt really saying much becuase the bugs make the game gross and people just play the same maps over and over again. If you can buy CS:GO please do and avoid this garbage. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE."
11330,"Well i love this game.
But i hate 1 thing about this game.
Why the hell these items are on trial time?
Seriously?Cmon!
Even spending cash on these items gives the time trial,this is just ridicilous!
Team Fortress 2 trial time is better if you want to even test run the item or craft it,the item.
Atleast it's the item stays forever,not like this one >:("
11331,"An absolutely horrible game very clearly founded upon the pay to win principle. It is literally based on Counterstrike 1.6. I cant believe this is new. Bad audio in general, bad music, boring repetitive gameplay, and the inclusion of the ever-popular ""RPG elements"" so that you feel like you should keep playing despite the near complete lack of a real game here because levels are involved if you do boring things forever."
11332,"I like it a lot. It's a great new take on the original Counter-Strike 1.6 . The great number of weapons, characters, maps and game modes add to the joy that is Counter-Strike Nexxon Zombies. Now getting serious there are some issues with the connection when you host a bot zombie mode while playing alone, but the servers are usually up to standards. The only real problem is that the game goes under maintenace often though it's usually down for only an hour or so and you get compensated for waiting."
11333,"pour l'instant je ne peux plus jouer a cause de la mise a jour , j'ai beau r√©installer mais sans succes, je voudrais que vous arranger cela car depuis l'ajout des armes akimbo JE NE SAIS PLUS RIEN FAIRE!!!!"
11334,FAce lag cumva sau nu face lag?
11335,is gr8 m8 i r8  8/8 praise gaben
11336,"It is what wou would expect from a Nexon game. You don't necessarily have to pay to win, but it seems to help. Overall, slightly enjoyable, but nonetheless boring."
11337,Great game lots of haters though
11338,"Pretty good, has regular CS on it and the zombie mode is pretty fun. A little hard to navigate for me, but still good"
11339,i love it
11340,"All the sounds and graphics are practically ripped right off old, ACTUAL counter-strike games. Hackers everywhere. Made by the same people who made Combat Arms, if that tells you anything. Total waste of time, don't bother. You're better off playing an actual counter-strike game."
11341,Fantastik game...:)
11342, This game is great and not so great. Get this game for a feel for Counter Strike. Don't get this game if you rage a lot. Enough said...
11343,"This suck u must pay every think what u do in game -.-"" Sry dudes!"
11344,"booooring,,"
11345,"I begin by saying that the graphics of cs 1.6 is its point of momentum, because not everyone has a pc suit '' gaming ''. I also add personally not a game Pay to win .. because the weapons can win in events held continuously .. and repeat the weapons and still not change the force that a player .. you can kill anyone with the standard weapons. Also the game in my opinion is in effect a fps lacks nothing, the few bugs that are found are resolved quickly by administrators who are constantly working. I invite you to not throw it like garbage bag only for graphics .. games beginning were not that .. we had a meaning and I think this it has to offer for a fps. Recall that this game still had a great success because it is the first launch of the game, there were others like online cso, cso japanese and other. I hope this review has served to make you understand that no matter how small the game has to offer. If something is ungrammatical understand me are Italian."
11346,Better than Counter-Strike 2D.
11347,"Crap game!
How can this someone even play ...
Wish i never try this."
11348,bad
11349,tare
11350,AWESOME GAME!!! WORTH IT!!
11351,"super easy to get into. 
not much different from other CS versions.

this is really more of a time waster if anything."
11352,"It's a fun game!!
"
11353,Great game but could have better graphics.
11354,Is in GOOD game is on kill zombie bot mi kill 1000000in one round
11355,Certain modes like zombie run and survival are fun but the rest is laughably bad. Bring a friend along to play if not don't get
11356,No.
11357,"The Only Thing Thats Best on this game is that you can play Counter-Strike 1.6 for free. Other.. P2W, Permenent Weapons (MyAss) (you have a gun for 108 days instead forever), Servers Laggy all the time,"
11358,This game gave me diarrhea ~
11359,CSNZ
11360,"I like the game
It has alot of potential and i love how you can craft weapons, especially because you can bring them into classic mode which makes it more intesting.
Its a good game to waste some time on but i do not suggest buying anything with irl money.
But nevertheless it is still a decent game and i think we should atleast give it 1 or 2 chances to get better.
Overall i rate it:

6/10
Decent but could be better
"
11361,"For those who never played this i recommend only Original  , TeamDeathmath and Deathmatch its a good game if u know how to play ."
11362,teq
11363,"nice

"
11364,"Poor graphics, lame zombies and game play.   If you want to play a zombie game I would look for something beside this one to spend your time on."
11365,Lets play it together.!!
11366,This Is God
11367,Be careful or u will not be allowed to live
11368,"It comes with 1.6......for free....get it if you are a newcomer, if not, then try out the game zombie mode, it is actually kinda fun."
11369,Good If You Pay........ the end
11370,this game is a joke ... when i first played this i just sat there and laughed my little penis off
11371,Absolutely Horrible
11372,not cs zombie mod
11373,"this game is really cool, and I play it ALOT"
11374,Very Fun
11375,"Its a good game, just buggy at times."
11376,Love this game!
11377,Worst game since CoD: Ghosts
11378,Bought 4 name changers
11379,dont play des game
11380,Decent just could do with some better grpahics thats all
11381,"My mini-review for Counter Strike Nexon Zombies:
After putting 30 hours into this game, I must say it's a time killer.
Pros:
-CS 1.6 for free
-Fun as hell game modes (Item Battle, Challenge, Gun Deathmatch, Original etc.)
-Weapon crafting
-Cool designs for weapons
-Still brings that old feel of CS.
-Old good zombies, not like now's generic crap.
Cons:
-Jesus, still with the 1.6 engine?
-Unbalanced system
-Awful comunnity full with noobs
-K/D ratio's are complete piece of crap, I probably died over 100 times and it counts them as 300?
-Zombie Scenario is awful, just shooting zombies for leveling up, that's all.
-Let's just say it, every zombie mode in this game is too damn repetitive.
-Microtransactions
-Human Scenario
-Boring daily and special missions.
-Does not count all the matches you played
-Pay to Win
-Rarely can find a pro
-Dumbass Menu
-Barely gives you points to shop after a match no matter what place you ended.
-Some maps are designed pretty bad.
An awful Counter Strike game that somehow still gets me into it.
I'm giving this game a......
5/10-A ruined version of CS 1.6 with heavily promoted zombie modes that get boring after sometime."
11382,"Too fucking laggy thats for sure, Bad graphics and sounds , also they just ruined counter strike by valve not making."
11383,just dont even try it. it that bad
11384,"five words, awesome zombie counter-strike for free
(counter-strike is one word right?)"
11385,good for bad pcs gameplay is ok but gets boring graphics not that good but it is a free to play so 6/10
11386,good game
11387,"Won't load for ""this game requires steam to play.""


11/10"
11388,"Well, this game had everything u needed, Zombie Original, Bot, Scape, Deathmatch, Scenario...I Totally loved it
u need a mexican Host XD and the will be perfect"
11389,"This game is amazing mutiplayer game, it has soo many cool ad-ons which make it an really interesting game!"
11390,"Good game people! Don't comment before you try it ! At first i don't liked this game but after 2 days i just love it <3 
You can level up,New weapons,Textures,Maps,Modes,etc!
And if you're a gamer just remember!
The gamers try all the games ^^
From the online games to the most 8 gb ram games or anothers! ^^"
11391,"Most irritating and bugged version of cs I've ever played. Constant crashes make me sometimes want to bite my keyboard. Nevertheless it's horribly addictive - I don't know why exactly, but I think variety of uncovered weapons is the main thing.

PS: football mode rocks!"
11392,Not recomanded
11393,"So much hate on this game...

Sure the game isn't your average Counter Strike Global Offensive, but it's free! Counter Strike normally costs 15‚Ç¨, but in this case it's a free game. You can give it a bash and see if you like it, because you don't have to pay anything.

Many people are also bitching about the ""Pay to Win"" aspect, but there is none! The default weapons are powerful enough and getting better weapons (or in this case different play style weapons) is easy if you play the game at least for 2h a week. 

The game even has many new game-modes that were not even imagined in Counter Strike 1,6. One of the amazing one's is where you and another team have to build your bases and defend against zombies. Or you can just go and have a fight instantly and see who is better with a knife.

The only big gripes about this game are - ancient graphics and the fact that scoping is a bit delayed and gets annoying over time (especially if you play games like CS:GO), but you don't have to stick to the snipers, because there are many powerful rifles without a scope unlike the legendary AWP.

The game is fair and good and is like the classic Counter Strike 1.6 with a ton of mods. Luckily unlike all those private servers on 1.6, this never crashes or has long joining times, because all of that is implemented into the game."
11394,"I don't think this game is supported on VMware Fusion 7 on OSX Yosemite. Everytime I attempt to launch it I get an error ""Hack sensor . . . It is not defined."""
11395,Take my word on this. this is truely the worst game ive ever played and im 44
11396,awsome zombie killing game even if the graphics need work lol its fun to play try to build bases and shoot zombies dead as hell lol
11397,It's a pretty good free game.
11398,"This game complety sucks ass nothing but spawn kills and bull shit aim bots half the time, dont believe nexon themselves say well we cant really ban hackers and the process takes months usally and no point in reporting. This is a pile of junk waiting to burn"
11399,"I dont care if they say that this game is crap, but I enjoy the Zombie Scenario/Shelter mode because is a CO OP against AI and a boss, the weapon mods are amazing (especially with the devil ones).

The only thing that I hate is the problem with hackers and the use of uber weapons in classic modes."
11400,Preety good.
11401,ERROR
11402,Confusing and mired in microtransactions. A really fun idea that I wish was executed better.
11403,This game is verry action packed and since it has low texture quallity it will probubly work on bad computers personaly my computer sucks and il get a decnet fps on this game. IT also has tuns of maps and fun gamemodes. I cant pick a favirete one cause i love so menny of them! i rate this game a 9/10 cause the things i dont like is that you have to renew your wepons durability and some other stuff but overall this game is amazing. and its free!
11404,Good game. Not amazing but good.
11405,"The developers should be ashamed, this game is a piece of crap for 2014. Heck, it'd be a piece of crap in 2000!

Uninstall worked fine. I even manually mopped up my registry and redistributables to get every filthy bit of space wasted by this download off my PC.
(The game leaves a file in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software named AHNlab, and has 2 2013 microsoft redistributables, in case you would like to *entirely* delete the game, not just uninstall it.)"
11406,Its a very boring game.
11407,"What did I just play? 
15 min of my life wasted."
11408,an old good style of cs :) poor graphics but it's good!
11409,Not even worth the space on my hard drive. And the hard drive isn't even 33% full.

This review has been detected by BlackSipher2."
11415,"Waste of Time

I am an old CS player and I have been playing CS Nexon : Zombies for 2 months

This game is bad in every way you look at it

Original mode is CS with over powered weapons ( the host can turn it off but nobody does that) and there is cheaters and hackers every where.

Zombies mode ( scenario, Hero ) are bad, the zombies are stupied and their shooting box is odd espically light zombie let alone the graphics. 

The crafting system sucks you will not get what you want and in the process you spend your hard erned materials.

in short saty away from this game as you will lose your time and burn your nervous."
11416,"this game is really cool. if you want a cool shooting game your in luck.graphics are bad, not that bad tho. its fun and really cool. its really a good game to play with friend.so thats it and peace out.as a bacca would say legit or nah?(P.S. the gaihla something like that is the best gun)."
11417,was fun is bad
11418,"What the crap is this?  This is Counter-Strike (not Source) with a cash shop.  Oh, and they force VCRedist + PB.  I bet you have to manually uninstall it.  Garbage."
11419,"look this game isnt perfect... but it is fun. Its CS for people who dont want to buy the real game. It has good game modes, there are some bugs but nothing that will mess up your gameplay. Im saying this now the game isnt for everyone, but its free, so that means it wont hurt you to try it out. So just go for it and try it out!

p.s. If you never played any CS before (like me) this game at first will make you rage, but still fun!"
11420,bad
11421,Crappy game
11422,Like every other F2P zombie game (Ex. Crossfire *mutants*) People cheat using bug exploits and hide in vents with a group of people never running out of ammo. Stupid waste of time. Toxic as always also.
11423,"I Know its just a mod but its riped off from CS:GO but in a horrible graphics version,and its pay to win or pay to get better...
And this is also bullshit for the fact when you craft a wepond its limited after the few days, YOU GOTTA PAY FOR IT BITCH."
11424,"nope.

tl;dr: no."
11425,i have no hack but the hack sensor is telling that i have hack. how to fix this issue?? thanks
11426,This game is fun if you like zombies
11427,fun game its the free to play virsion of CS GO. not saying its nearly as close of a game just saying it's the same concept and it wasnt a bad job. Couple things like being able to buy some really overpowered guns and not being able to choose a harder bot diffculty unless you get 1000 kills on the previous lv are kind of annoying. So to sum it up it has all the classic cs modes (no comp tho) and has some new modes such as the zombie modes and the soccer mode. All in all a fun game to give you an intro to CSGO
11428,"very fun, addicting"
11429,"I never found this to be fun and to just even play the game is difficult because joining or starting a game is difficult enough. It always seemed impossible to join a game because it just threw you into a match no matter the level (or wave you'd like to call it). If you want me to recommend something, I'd recommend Zombie Panic Source instead, now THAT was fun. Or No more Room in Hell, that was free too."
11430,"It is pretty good, low quality graphics but over all it is really fun."
11431,nope
11432,"Usuly if a gae is free i would probobly just say downoad it cuz its a free game, but this is really shit. dont bother to download"
11433,Thus game is awesome
11434,"I like this game,because is very funny!!! :D"
11435,"Playable without paying.


Not the most pay to win is what I'm trying to say.


7/10"
11436,Game is unplayable in its current state. Random disconnects makes you waste more time to get anything done (or maintain your high rank).
11437,cool game reminds me of old days playing counter strike 1.6
11438,a very fun zombie game !!!!!!!!
11439,This game is by far the worst game ive played this game made  me hate zombies games...
11440,wery good shoter game
11441,ok
11442,Kurva j√≥ :D
11443,Did not like it
11444,:)
11445,WORST GAME NA
11446,I like the part when you uninstall it
11447,it is great and has alot of fun gamemodes besides zombies overall fun
11448,Unistall works ^^
11449,ok so how to play as a women?
11450,This game has the worst graphics + its a game made by the ones who made counter strike: Global Offensive OMG!!!! ITS'S @#%$&* I tell you @#%$&*
11451,Counter-Strike Nexon is a very good and intertaming game for FTP game.It combines counter-strike and zombie modes its very interesting to play if you dont have any other games temporaly on steam.I would reccomend this to everyone who is looking for a little escape from his ussual games.this is my firs review
11452,"Source with zambiees, its cool but it has a lot of bug and sometimes the main menu is f@cking laggy... :D"
11453,"I kinda liked the game at first, but then iafter i played a few matches i discovered that this game is shit. the hitboxes are super fucked up, its a pay-to-win, the damage done to enimies registers in the fucking wierdest way (headshots rarely kill), and there is no team-comunity. its pretty much just another shity free-to-play FPS. sure you can light someone up with a couple hundred rounds, but the  accuracy on any lmg or AR is about 1%-10%. unles you just single fire all the time, and even then your hit raio is like 30%. pluss, you cant even use your ironsight. all in all, if you wanna win this game, take a shit tone of drugs. thats pretty much the only way."
11454,"Would uninstall again

10/10"
11455,"I don't see how people hate this game. All it is is just CounterStrike 1.6, with added Zombie mode. And I had a frikin blast."
11456,A very good game for people who have a little time to spare.
11457,"wont let me play says i need steam to play this and im playing it on steam !
"
11458,"really cool game for free i highly sugest that you get this game :)
"
11459,"its ok i guess.the graphics could be better,but still."
11460,"Don't even bother. A sloppy, incoherent mess. Stick to 1.6 or Source instead."
11461,i wanna play this on my mac :c
11462,Its like call of duty infected but counter strike which makes it even better.
11463,free
11464,Good game <3
11465,Cool Games!
11466,"i have really njoyed playing this, it takes some getting used to but once you get going it feels like cs1.6 but better. the negative comments should be taken with a pinch of salt, as its free to play download it and try it yourself.
after quite a few hours playtime i have noticed some major bugs that are in this game.
1: after finishing a game your level appears to be one level higher than it should be(EXP: count is wrong as when you return back to the main menu you have lost EXP)
2: weapon enhancements can decrease themselves if you get a fail on the enhancements page(this is more than frustrating due to the points you have to spend for enhancement material compared with its success/fail ratio)
3: zombies are to OP!!!! in hero mode or mutant mode zombies are almost un killable!!! this needs some sewrious balancing out
4: IAP(in game purchases) they advertise packages from 0.34p but you are required to put 4 pound minimum into your steam wallet before purchase *(not as advertised price due to steam wallet)

i have enjoyed a couple of the game modes and have enjoyed the game, but with a lot of unbalancing involved dont bother playing some modes in single mode its impossible to defeat scenario and shelter modes with just one player, you need your friends online with you as randoms just do there own thing (no actual team play)"
11467,:)
11468,"I downloaded this game for my grandson.  He loves it.  When the OS on my original system crashed and he couldn't play for five days this game was the first one he asked me to get back on my new system.  Plays well and no stutter on the minumum requirements.  Highly recommend it.  Wish the other multiplayers wouldn't use foul language though.  My grandson is only eight years old.  He knows the ""bad"" words and knows to never repeat them.  C'mon guys, clean it up!"
11469,i play this before when i was little and then playing it with zombies make me want to play even more
11470,"all that this game does is crash my computer for no reason
"
11471,"it's a very good game, just because it has CS 1.6 on it..."
11472,:d
11473,GAME IS SUCK
11474,cool
11475,it wont start it keeps terminating the server i just started
11476,ihar a server error cant connect to server
11477,"not great,no leveling or unlocks and all the weapons are unlocked,so it is quite unbalanced ,and its bland and repetative gameplay"
11478,Great theres already a mod for this http://www.moddb.com/mods/counter-strike-xtreme. but its great because its cs 1.6 but free.
11479,You can play Counter-Strike for free.
11480,It's epic :spycon:
11481,"Nope This Game requires Steam  i hate tht
"
11482,"Este super smecher jocu vil recomand intrati cu prieteni si:DINSTRATIVA
"
11483,Un Nexon cv? :)))
11484,"Not bad,not good"
11485,"Good graphics, new guns, awesome game."
11486,Its free you dont need to read the recommendation thing just play it and see if you like it i did thats for sure :3
11487,"It's just counter strike 1.6 with a few added features and a lot of blant money grab scam.  I would not recommend this game  cuz CS 1.6 is over 10 years old and shouldn't be used to MILK people's money anymore,  beside it was a FREE mod to begin with! To me, this game is an insult to the old classic just play CS 1.6 instead if you feel nostalgic."
11488,"Too many campers with MG's, and getting shot as a zombie slows you down, so it's almost impossible to kill anyone once they reach a safe location. In simplest terms...

Meh."
11489,"This is a good free fps.

1 out of 10 

I would say 9"
11490,"Everyone gives this alot of hate but i like it.
Try zombie chase"
11491,"preety cool game good job nexon and valve
"
11492,"I find this game very fun, although the lack of ability to increase your skills for good with say a one time purchase, or by leveling up, it's still fun to spray loads of zombies with a variety of different weapons. 7/10"
11493,why are people complaining its free :) its not as bad as people say try it for yourself
11494,i dont see whats wrong with this game i think its fun
11495,Nay.
11496,dont knock it till you try the game my friends
11497,Does anyone really like this?
11498,"This game is like enrolling in a junior high where 70% percent of the students are mentally challenged and the other 30% are russian or chinese kids with their own version of downs syndrome.  The zombie modes are pretty fun and easy, I imagine if you grew up on a farm with no electricity and just got introduced to video games yesterday you might have problems but honestly the game is 'point gun at zombie, hold mouse down until zombie goes away.' There is no play to win because you can't spend money on jackshit and if you did you must have smoked some crack just beforehand. The game looks like counterstrike era 1999 so don't expect to be blown away or anything, but it's a decent free to play zombie killer with some other modes thrown in to round it off. Compared to a ton of the other zombie games that actually charge you money while at the same time being unfinished turds or vaporware garbage, this one is pretty entertaining."
11499,this game is awsome i like it cause its not just about zombies its just like the clasic counter strike i recomend it to first time players.
11500,"This game used to be Pay 2 Win, but I'm glad they modified that system for a craft-based one for its occidental release. 

Still quite fun, would recommend if you're not obsessed with realism graphics and gameplay.
(Keep in mind that this remake of CS isn't new. It's just that they recently put in on Steam)"
11501,very high ping and lags :(
11502,First of all this game is NOT Pay-to-Win. People find an excuse to hate on this game because they think it's bad when they only play for such a small amount of time. The Zombie modes aren't that great but Zombie Scenario is quite enjoyable plus you get more EXP and items and recipes. The crafting system is great and you have chances to get really good permanent weapons. I tend to play only for the Original mode which is basically CS 1.6 just a bit different. If you can't get kills just because of the selection of guns you have then you really just have to GIT GUD you SCRUBS.
11503,"Hmmm...
Pluz
 Free
 many gamemodes

Down
 bad grafics
 damage/gun power seams unbalenced


Over all I say If you need a free time waster, with no money(Like Me) this is for you...
Other wise If you are a intense gamer with a lot of money...
your better of with CS:GO"
11504,"Probably one of the few games of 2014 that looks like it came from 1994 and has a terrible sound engine and most of the images look like someone too a picture of them with a crappy flip phone and then uploaded them into their game engine some of the zombies attacks increases your FOV but then you see through your arms a bit and looks really crappy... And is a big Pay-To-Win game but is really really fun if you're looking for a game that installs quick and have fun with your friends and pass time this is probably it, crap graphics, sound still really really fun I enjoy this game a lot!"
11505,"i cant play the game each time i open it, it said this game requirs steam, i already have steam and i already got the game with it it doesnt work,<HELP ME HERE>."
11506,its a really good game i like dogs if you like dogs too hit the erm well say it
11507,just no...
11508,"Boss fights are impossible because noobs with default weapons won't press g.

gg

Wait a second, you don't care about zombies?

It has no P2W content and it's 1.6 with restrictions. Cool game for no bucks. Not even Nexon could fuck this up."
11509,"This game is great fun, especially for a free to play game. Lots of different game modes including zombie modes, deathmatch modes and even first person football! Addictive too. I recommend definately! Try it if you havent :0)"
11510,It wont let me play the game
11511,"Good old CS16, with multikill counter and announcer, and some more enhancements.

Zombie Original and Zombie Hero mods are actually quite fun. Yes, you do have to find a safe one-path-only accessible camping spot and try to push zombies army back with your bullets. The success depends on team's reload timing and number of the zombies.. Zombie Hero even adds health regen, respawn until not decapitated and some useful skills for zombies, which adds more challenge for the survivors. Also, when you die in Classic mode, you can only sit and watch for the next round. In Zombies, even though you get infected by a tiny scratch, you get the chance to play as a zombie; every enemy infection counts as a kill and every kill counts :)

Does anyone remember slaughtering knife-only bots with a machinegun? Things got even more amusing with Zombie Scenario and Zombie Shelter modes. Face waves of zombies together with friends or strangers...

Still not enough? There's DM, Team DM, Gun Game, soccer maps, or the immortal Classic mode, all in one free-to-play package. Counter-Terrorists win!"
11512,Well.... this was disapointing
11513,"For some strange reason im pretty good at it so eh ill leave my opinion on it 
Well to start if your playing Zombie Hero the zombies are pretty much invincible but if your playing one of the gamemodes where the zombies are bots its not as challanging otherwise the zombies are almost inpenitrble or whatever that word is 
anyhow i reccomend this game for people that enjoy zombie games or just playing counter strike"
11514,This game is ok
11515,Funny game with multiple mods even it if gets repetitive after a while its always fun to shoot zombies at will !!
11516,Giant waste of time
11517,"This is basically free cs 1.6 with zombies, new guns, microtransactions and connection problems. so it is a good game but with bad ""upgrades"". It's pretty fun to play with your friends especially the old gamemodes. The game tries to have some p2w mechanics but awp is still the king and ak47 still kills with a single headshot so buying the newer guns isn't necessary. The overall feel of classic cs 1.6 is still there.

What really kills this game is the connection problems and the fact that you need a decent computer to play some of the zombie modes which still look old and terrible.

I'd actually recommend this game if you were to play with your friends. If you on the other hand plan to play alone know that 90 % of players don't know how to chat."
11518,11/10 Uninstall Simulator 2014!!!
11519,Generally bad quality all round
11520,"EDIT 2: Forewarning that impacts my review heavily: They've both removed a permanent item from my iventory** *and*  my review was edited with that message being deleted. I've   contacted Valve and they won't do it. Most large review sites only accept paid news articles. TotalBiscuit even refused it.


This will be a more serious review as it has the Counter Strike/F2P ""click-bait"" name to it. To put it simply, it's a Combat Arms Pay2Win/F2P first person shooter. It has parts of it that are entertaining and parts of it that are abysmal, even worse than CA. Calling it CS is far from the truth.

Most of the modes suck outside of about 2. I recommend their equivalent of Gun Games called Gun Deathmatch (for balance), and the Zombie Scenario: Tracking (if you're interested in purely killing thiings mindlessly). Every other game mode is imbalanced and P2W-favored. The guns are weak unless you pay money or use cheats. Did I mention they use the notorious ""Anti-Hack Shield""? It's useless if you're new to it. I'm not saying everyone cheats, it's just a useless system. There are no fidelity options, the game looks like s***. That's sorta a good thing because even bad computers easily push high FPS. But it looks like it was ported from PS2; it's bad. And the low reqs of it cause a lot of game ruiners to play. And no one talks on this game - text or mic. It's by far the leas strategic FPS I've seen and played, both due to gameplay and that communication issue.

It's the best F2P first-person shooter out there, to be honest. But that isn't saying much.. Even if you're very poor, I urge you to pay money for a game that doesn't suck. It definitely isn't worth playing. I left out some key points to keep this shorter, I just hope I prevents people from making the mistake of installing this. I cannot believe Valve backed it or it's called Counter Strike.... I suppose you can't expect much out of Nexon anyway."
11521,"First of all dont listen to negatives cause they just whine about it being p2w and zombies are too OP. Well thats bullshit.
This game is in no way p2w unless your a dumbass to pay for a female model (which doesnt do shit). And also the zombies being strong reminds of old cs 1.6 zombie server days because it was hell lot of fun. If you played cs 1.6 this game is fun for you and has lot of original and fun modes (like zombie shelter). Try it."
11522,You can't be female ??Had i known the game was gender locked i wouldn't have even wasted my time downloading this crap !
11523,"people seem to not even realize this isn't only a bad zombie mode, but it's also the sexy original 1.6,  with Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Gun Mode, Search and Destroy, and more... <3 <3 <3"
11524,"Menus are confusing. Gameplay makes zero sense. I've played many FPS and this one is definitely one of the worst. 

I could draw out an explanation for why this game is terrible, but the above sentences while concise make my point without the need for paragraphs."
11525,this is coooooooooooooooool !
11526,its just awful
11527,"To be completely honest about this game, it is not good at all. The graphcis are terrible and the sound effect of when you are killed by a zombie or kill a zombie are repeated so many times in the course of a game that you want to quit.  There is no way I would ever buy it but since it is free to play the people who don't play real games may actually enjoy this.  2/10."
11528,"At first i was about to write a negative review, but i didn't. You happy now?"
11529,Okay I took a break from this game a couple months and came back with no stats. The game deleted all my stats for some reason. I notice another review below a person said his stats got deleted also.. can you please fix this. Also the game is pretty decent not bad for a free game. I mainly play the zombie shelter mode because I love building a base. There should be more maps released tho theres only been 3 maps released threwout all the years this game been alive. Also the room owner should be able to kick people out in game because trolls join the room and destroy the base and leave.
11530,had more fun uninstalling it.
11531,Sucks cause i lag but not lag in counter strike global offensive wtf.

No perm guns out yet except buying the $0.99 crafting crap, which is like 1/1000 chance of getting a perm.  One thing I like compared to Tiancity's is that they do not give us AWP and what-not as defaults, compared to this CS Nexon:Z, we get AWP as defaults. Most people here DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PLAY. The zombie classes are great, but a little costly. Hopefully, they will update this game faster with new weapons and stuff."
11535,amazing
11536,this is awsome its better tyhen every other counter strick
11537,well maybe its rip off and models costs. but its still free cs1.6. whats bad about that? still have the magnum sniper for free which is great
11538,It is a very nice game based on CS 1.6 ! You cand play clasic or with zombies.
11539,IS OK GAME!

11553,I start the game and i dont join in game and the game FALL !!!! Stupid i delete this !!!!
11554,"Counter-Strike with zombies, you what else did you want? Fish AI?"
11555,KLASS
11556,"good game
 if you play"
11557,"i dont know why people are complaining.
-there is a crafting system which can grant you acces to new weapons
-daily rewards to keep you playing
-weapons handle like some sort of merge between all counter strike games' recoils i.e. FUCKING SHWEET
-gamemodes are fun but sometimes harsh (aka zombie gamemodes)
-if you are a cheap fudge like me that wants to buy cs 1.6 get this game. its free and has more content
-if you consider this game extremely pay2play well then fudging stop playing csgo or tf2 because those games also have the ability to buy cosmetics
-wow big advantage fudgetards paying for cosmetics make this game ""unbalanced""
-have you ever heard of ""selecting you region""? do you wear glasses or are you dislikers just plain stupid for selecting Asia whenever you want to play on an American server (or something among those lines)?
as you can see The Abominable GMan is mad for others disliking this game. please help him feel better by TRYING THIS FUCKING GAME BECAUSE YOU WONT DIE BECAUSE ITS MADE BY ASIAN PEOPLE"
11558,"This game is really cool, especially seeing as it is free. The marketing system in-game can be a little annoying, with weapons being timed to try to force you to spend money for them; however, you can craft weapons from materials you collect in-game, which counteracts that. The gameplay itself is very smooth, and weapons won't outdo skills so every match is fair."
11559,"i like the deathmatch cuz it doesnt matter if u have the best gun, u can just use the awp to 1 shot ppl"
11560,"it's counterstrike, but with repetitive music that loops every 7 seconds, graphics and game modes ripped straight out of combined arms, and fucking character models with stats

playing this game if you have the money for CS:GO/S is like scratching your scrotum with sandpaper while looking at a multibillion dollar swedish taint scratcher with kung fu grip and built in bottle opener"
11561,Its a good game if you can pay to win its worth a try though it unistalls quick
11562,"Boring, not enough players."
11563,com
11564,Overall pretty fun game... if you can put aside the graphics :p
11565,its one of a kind **ITS AMAZING
11566,"I do not see why this game gets all the hate it does. So far as I've played this game is unique in how it is a total conversion for  C.S 1.6 as well it gives the core game to play with most of the original default weapons for free. I ask you the reader how this can be a bad thing even though this game has a cash shop it is almost completely unnecessary becaus when you login daily yu get given some weapons. I have heard of people complaining about the fact that weapons are not permanent well I say to you this why pay more in a cash shop for permanent weapons when you probably will not be playing the game super regular in 3 or 4 months this way with thier setup you pay much less for a weapon .99c as a matter of fact and last a reasonable amount of time less money spent upfront and in your playfield makes a better experience I Think. also the payed weapons have more power right away but the standardized weapons have more parts for deconstructing(I wont get into great detail about mechanics I will let you play and find out I am just proving a concept)so as to give you parts to upgrade better weapons ,also I think they might have more upgrade slots(don't hold me to this as I've only just started weapon customization at the time of this review).Furthermore the gameplay is smooth in almost all different modes and really shines in the orginal modes,this game even offers a deadlyu version of team football kicking the ball can kill an opponent. As one of the only downsides of this game is host connectivity issues causing minor to heavly moderate interruptions in gameplay but nexxon I think is working adding optimization patches to the client as well as there dedicated servers In closing this game can use some slight improvements to its self and mabye some instance balancing as well as promoting the fact that it is not pay 2 win as most people think  Overall this game deserves an 8.8/10"
11567,DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.
11568,"gra jest wy≈õmienita eventy i szczeg√≥lnie do≈ºo lvl i du≈ºo ludzi,Polecam gre kto chce ze mnƒÖ zagraƒá niech do mnie pisze na steam"
11569,"This game is better than most give it credit, and its Free. Yes it has a ton of glitch's , strange enemy's, and a shit aiming system. But yes this is worth a play, I like zombie shelter level and getting  friends to download and play is not a problem. I have payed for games that where much worse than this one.  7/10"
11570,"The Best free to play zombie game EVER. This game is not the top for graphics, but it does pack a whole lot with content. From the weapon crafting to over 35+ game modes and maps, this is by far, the fairest and best free to play game out there. Sure, there are microtransactions just like any other F2P game and there are gun rentals, but it is to my opinion 100% fair. im not sure how many total weapons are in this game, been playing for a while and still seeing new ones. 

This game has alot of game modes, Your usual TDM, FFA, SND, infected, survival (PVP & PVE), fun maps, the hidden, rocket fights, snipers only, melee only, co op story mode (PVE & PVP), bots.... needless to say there is ALOT. 

The game runs great. For anyone who has a ""cheaper"" PC the low graphics help run the game even better. 

what else do i need to say? JUST PLAY IT!

11580,dont even bother. its a shit game
11581,"The Title does not say everything about this game indeed there are zombies in the game but there are all so way more then that if you dont like zombies you could just play Team Deathmatch or some other CS modes.It is not near as good as any other CS title it is far from it but it is still good and i recommend this to mostly newcomers to the CS series the hardcore CS fans should stay away.

7,4/10

if your a hardcore CS fan i give it a 5/10"
11582,it's ok
11583,i love this game but it doesnt work and it always says this game requires steam or it will say this game is already running but its not running
11584,Good game bad graphics :D
11585,"im playing on a toaster, and you can play counterstrike without zombies, and bots also. but you need to be online. 

i cant run the zombie game modes, but right now im just working on easy bots until i unlock harder bots(havent played counterstrike in years) 

it also has a pretty innovative daily gift/bonus system. theres some type of crafting, ive only played it like three times so far, but its pretty good."
11586,"aa this game rools man it is te best and its free 
"
11587,"Realy nice game with many diffrent levels and weapons. Also if you lose you don't have to wait for your turn, but it turns you into a zombie and play again at no time !"
11588,pretty much a free version of source...very fun
11589,"Its really CS But free i hope they update the graphics to be thats the only thing thats making me give this a lower score...

11590,"Laggy, buggy. For me I found it unplayable. But it was free. So I can recomend it if you didn't already have 1.6."

11592,It For some reason wont even let me in and it says it operated by the rights of the general what ever.. it made me mad... I reallly Reallly Reallllllllyyyyy wish this game ACTUALLY WORKED on my pc!
11593,you can never kill the zombies. you can shoot them with a whole clip all day long and the zombie is like go f*** yourself shitty game

11598,i try to load up the game and it says i need steam when i clearly have it please help me.
11599,good and fun game but what i really hate is that when in shelter mode i hate when a enemy puts a gun tower near the other team base cause it just make's it hard to get out without being hit tyring to heal by a medic table could be impossible try makeing a gun sentry distance limite so they wont troll and put it to close

Zoooooombiess : )"
11605,Just 8/10. Cuz its rly 50% CrossFire and 50% Cs 1.6
11606,There was really no need for this to be released over in Europe.. it's beyond awful and gives cs a bad name. There's plenty of modded zombie servers that people have been using.. even the original mode on this.. I thought the movement was bad on csgo but they're running up short before you even look up mid :D:
11607,Nice :D
11608,way to complicated to start a round
11609,"This game is quite lame. Honestly I was expecting more from it but was very disapointed. But if you want screw around a little bit and have SOME fun, it's not that bad. This game runs out very fast and you're better of with a game like Left 4 Dead. Really you gotta play and try it out, it's free so why not. Could be better."
11610,"Amazing 2014 reincarnation of the classic Counter Strike game, But this time with a twist: ZOMBIES. This is basically a free version of Counter Strike. You can play all the original game modes and maps. Now they've added zombies into the mix. I've had hours of fun out of this game and highly recommend playing it. ‚ò∫‚òª‚ô•‚ô¶‚ô£‚ô†"
11611,why is it saying hack block when i didn't hack if that is what that means i don't know how to hack or anything like that.
11612,This game is actually really fun if you know how to play it
11613,yes this game might have not so good graphics but it is really fun not much lag so this game is in the bag HAY lag bag
11614,Can't compare with other cs's
11615,Cannot get on the game anymore :/
11616,thought it was gonna be bad but it's actually a good game.
11617,"Nice game :)
"
11618,I like it
11619,gyaa
11620,i decided to give this game a chance despite the negative reviews. IT'S HORRIBLE.  I would rather eat at ARBYS than to play this game again. You will have more fun watching static on an old analog television.
11621,"Menus suck.... period. I mean really suck. Upgrade guns but where the F are they?  Oh and btw counter-strike the series is not that great.  I can go to google apps for Chrome on PC and play 2 or 3 versions of counter-strike, right along side gun blood and angry birds. Some players take it way to serious. I mean to say that when you got one guy on one side and 7 on the other and it is a gib fest with the one man team winning over and over,  you get the sense that it is a effing set up. 

Counter-strike? More like Counter-clockwise."
11622,"PLUSES:
+ It doesn't matter what about is it, it is just CS
+ Various game modes
+ Weapon crafting

MINUSES:
- Unbalanced Zombie Escape ""Skyline"". Humans can only win when, zombies are noobs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmWTulagtHY
- There is a bug that you watch up and down instead of forward (W) and downward (S) in anytime of game. You must quit the game then launch it again for solution.

Update: Support doesn't give a damn thing about users, when I said that achievements are the way too impossible even if you gather 8 players, they said play with friends. Game has bugs, for example, I logged everyday, but now I see that I missed 7 days of login bonuses. Every update is just money-sucker."
11623,First it was an game full of inovations. Now they tried to make a moneymachine out of the game and they failed all the way. Now the game is only playable if you are drunked or druged. From a good game to terrible shit. Good work greedy people
11624,"Listen, if you like a casual game where you can play to have fun. try it for yourself before you listen to these comments. yes, the zombies can be made better but there are other game modes on this. give it a try. And Nexon if you could make the zombie modes not as over powered over the humans. It'll make it more fun."
11625,"After seeing all this bad reviews, I thought oh this is gunna be another shitty nexon FPS but really its just a redone counter strike 1.6 with a zombie mode added to it. Its the same as 1.6 just the ui and stuff are modernized."
11626,awesome to play zombies almost better then cod zombies :D
11627,Crude graphics and blah play. Looks like something from the '90's.
11628,This game is AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!! And its free:)
11629,Best to test the game yourself
11630,"This game is probably the best one on steam, it's balanced and feels like an actual counter strike. I recommend this game to any steam user who reads this review."
11631,The game keeps crashing can't even play. 0/10
11632,worst game ever
11633,"This game is pure epic and you can really enjoy playing with humans or zombies. Heh, joke! Now seriously: This game is fucking bad, need some balance, because zombies are too op! Graphic is ok for me. Reminds me cs 1.6, and it's all i can say about this game. If you decided to download this game, this will be the worst decision in your life."
11634,its okay

The Zombie gamemodes in this game seem very dull. Idk what it is but every gamemode containing zombies just gets way too repetitive way too quickly."
11644,Its a good game but its very laggy and not much fun l would recommend you play Team Fortress 2 instead its still FREE!

This game is counter strike 1.6 with more than enough shitty micro transaction features that dont just ruin 1 mode, they ruin all the modes.
In Asia this game would have a lot of potential but everyone should think about not doing the same in EU/USA.

Pro's
Its free (duh)
They kept the same style as they did in 1.6
you may recognize some things from back in the old days.

Con's
its free
The graphics are the same as they were in 1.6
Microtransactions.
The Host system
pings

Zombie health if you want to take that to consideration.

i mostly play TDM so my only downside is 
1. spawncampers almost always
2. its ran by nexon, nexon will ruin it but its fine for now"
11660,"ok so i thought it was an ok game until i entered a contest. then it went to hell. first a guy shot an ally. then i kill him next round later (when im trying to play) a guy whom saw it killed me. i kill him next round. THEN another guy tryed to kill me with a sniper rifle. i kill him. finnaly the host, whom shot me beffor, shot me IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD. then when i kill him later the round ends. THEN HE KICKS ME. all i did was try to protect myself and get back at a teamkiller. (the host was the team killer. he had shot other friends aswell.) and here was his excuse. ""he said it was fine."" no one said anything. then he said ""you shot me for no reson"" he had shot me in the back of the head.

11670,Good game :)))))
11671,"Despite being made by Nexon; don't know what the problem with that company is to people, but I really like the game although it has some flaws. Let's look at the bright side though, there's a lot of cool weapons, crafting system, inventory system, seasonal events, zombie modes, and a human scenario mode. It even has the old CS 1.6 maps, weapons, and modes! You can even play stuff like Demolition and stuff like that! They also tried balancing a lot of things, although they did kind of a bad job on that since a LOT of the guns are overpowered, then again it IS Counter-Strike.
The nitpicks... well, ingame transactions. I know they tried kind of balancing it like TF2, but it would be nice if you could buy most of the stuff with in-game points rather than real money. Or both options! It is true that it would be nice to support the developers but for the people who don't have a lot of money / don't have money to spare, it's a HUGE disadvantage. Also, it'd be great help if it was easier to obtain the free stuff and give players more than just what they have to get for spending time on their game.
Also, every game has really annoying bots so people who complain towards that need to re-think.
On the subject of nitpicks, it would be cool if it would reward you for more skill than luck. Sometimes it feels like it's luck if you get this drop or that drop. What would be more nice is even more missions than the daily and weekly missions you already have. The honor quests are pretty good, but maybe instead of honor you could get EXP, Points, or blueprint drops. They drop way too many durables.
That'd be all."

-Now your Counter-Strike have Zombies, Aliens, Ghosts, Vodoo Priests, Creepy Little Girls, Dragons and Anime Girls on it!!!

-I like the promoting cover and the awrworks.

[Cons]

-F2P game, but of course there is a shop for you to buy better weapons if you like......because you must grid a lot.

-Jesus Christ. This is must be the first time I really hated an Option Screen so much. Unfriendly for the user and very complicate for a person you want just to kill zombies...

-A lot of different kind of enemies to kill.........but all of them act EXACTLY THE SAME!!! Come on!!!!

-*starting the game* Well.....thank you for r*ping my ears with the guns of the others, firing them brainlessly to the Zombies Hordes. Having for first weapon a Chaingun as well, help [hurt] a lot more,

-Yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh........killing an endless waves of enemies for over 10-15 minutes to open a f*cking door without any kind of challenge what so ever is ssssoooooooooooooooooo fun!
....................
*quit game* 

-Another Zombie game......this count as a negative for the poor quality of the game.

[FInal Thoughts]

I have a confession to make:
I always wanted to play this game from the first day I saw it. Of course I saw it back in 2008 and it was only availiable in South Korea [I think...].
I mean, picture this: Terrorists fighting Zombies. How awesome it sound?!?!?!
But sadly, the quality of the specific version of the game.......is terrible, TERRIBLE. Reality hurt so much man.....
Even if it is free, don't play it please.........

11685,"Man, this thing is the worst ... i don't think i can call it a game, most likely a modification to a good old game thing:
-Confusing Menu for new players;
-CS with COD weapons and zombies. AWFUL;
-Nonsense missions and timeline;
-Kinda destroys the CS games' reputation ONLY because of the name;
-And too many other complaints. The only ""good"" thing is that you can play some original CS 1.6 maps without zombies. Other than that, i do not recommend this game to anyone... And, please, if you want good zombie games, check the other games, waaay better than this thing..."
11686,I LIKE THIS GAME BUT THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS WHY DOES THE GAME NO LONGER LOAD AND FAIL ON STARTUP EVER SINCE THE NOVEMBER 7TH MATINENCE FIX?  IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.
11687,It take my spare time to play. Its kinda worth it. I like zombie ecsape and zombie shelter but zombie shelter is like rust and zombie escape is is PARKOUR WOOOH!!!

11689,"I don't know why people not recommend this awesome game, It is fun and addictive, it has good game modes so people can have fun of them. If you like CS 1.6 and Zombies you will enjoy this Free To Play game.

11690,lags in spawn
11691,"*WARNING: This game is a modded version of Counter-Strike 1.6, a game that came out in 1999, so the graphics are way outdated
*I've played quite a bit of Counter-Strike Online before CSN:Z was released, so keep that in mind with this review.
*TL;DR at the bottom for those who are lazy.

A lot of people seem to hate this game but I love it. Honestly how can anyone not like the fact that it Counter-Strike 1.6 with Condition Zero models that is free? Yes, there is a shop that offers character skins and weapon blueprints to use to craft weapons. But you don't have to buy any of that stuff to enjoy this game. I've been playing this version since it's USA release on 10/7/2014 with only buying the Jennifer and Natasha skin pack becuase they are permanent and will not be offered again for a long time. I did not buy any weapon blueprints becuase I know that eventually Nexon will offer the special weapons in the shop for permanent purchase. I've made it to Lvl. 42 without crafting a single weapon. I've played a lot of hours in Zombie Scenario with just the default load-out that is given in CS1.6. All it takes to get a special weapon (in my case) is to ask nicely for somebody to drop one for you if they have one and the money to do so. 9 times out of 10 somebody will drop one for me and hell, there are times where a nice player will just drop weapons for the other players. Maybe I'm just lucky, but there will be times that you'll be brushed off to the side and have to deal with the default weapons. Just ignore it and keep shooting because Zombie Scenario is manageable with competent players all using default weapons.

I completely understand and agree that Zombie Scenario can be tedious and monotonus with the whole ""shoot wall, advance, shoot more walls/boxes/door, then fight a boss that has a RIDICULOUS amount of health"" but I think the new maps and missions are a breath of fresh air if you play Original mode or Team-Deathmatch often. But whatever, it just reminds me of the deleted scenes from Condition Zero, and I enjoyed those missions in the deleted scenes.

The ""Pay-2-Win"" mindset that seems to be one of the biggest complaints in many reviews, but everyone needs to understand that nobody is forcing you to spend your real life money to play this game. Those special weapons are USELESS (with the exception of Skull weapons) against humans. They are only effective on zombies. Not only that but those special weapons are rare when it comes to crafting, that's why they're ""special weapons"". If you've spent money trying to craft them with no success, then stop trying (it may be too late for some of you). They'll eventually be sold for a limited time permanently. The optional skins do have their own stats and perks, but those perks are only available in zombie modes.

I know it's only been a month since it's CSN:Z has been released as I type this review, but I hope that Nexon eventually moves to their ""update every 2 weeks"" model like they do for CSO to keep this game fresh. I want to play Season 4 of Zombie Scenario. I want to run through the Envy Mask stage already.

PROS:
- CS 1.6 for free
- Weapon blueprints and skins are optional
- TONS of game modes (Original, Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, Zombie Original, Zombie Scenario, and much more that even I haven't played yet)
- The fact that the default CS1.6 weapons are all unlocked PERMANENTLY from the get-go. (In Counter-Strike Online, you have to BUY many of the default weapons that last a maximun of 30 days. WHO WANTS TO BUY THE M4 AND CV47 FOR ONLY 30 DAYS?! We should feel lucky that CSN:Z offers all the default weapons for free and permanent.)
- There are additional weapons in this game. (I've played modded versions of CS1.6 with different weapon skins and such; only difference is that you have to earn them in this game instead of changing model files)
- You don't need a monstrous gaming rig to play this game (my laptop is not meant for gaming and it still runs fine)

CONS:
- Microtransactions with a side of rarity in crafting special weapons to go with it (optional)
- Bugs that still haven't been addressed yet since release (windowed lobby, server lag at times amongst others)
- Bosses can have too much health (looking at you Revenant and you, Kraken)
- That damn FLASHLIGHT!!!

TL;DR
This game if fun if you take it for what it is: CS 1.6 with Condition Zero models and a TON of game modes (Classic game modes and new game modes)"

I had a bigger review but a steam sign pop up and i've lost everything so i'm gonna try other thing until i get my mood to write again.

This game it's a joke, i see 1 millon people walking down the streets, demanding to the ONU for the feets and hands of the developers and publishers of this game to be cutted off and burried next to hitler."
11693,"what teh hell is the duffle bag in dis game,can't buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"
11696,11/10 because of the chickens
11697,good game with different modes
11698,"This is the bastard son of what was once a great game. No option, no dedicated servers, it tries valiently to reclaim it's lost throne only to fail miserably and crush your nostalgia. Due to the servers being a Free-to-Play style setup with only Official servers, the hit registry is terrible and the added guns, skins, and modes are an competitive players nightmare. The game seems buggy and stutters a lot, and the guns feel terrible. Sound is often glitched resulting in the direction of gunfire being horribly confusing. Overall, a very vain attempt to bring the classic back to it's former glory but I don't believe any amount of work will ever make give this game the legendary stature it once possessed. R.I.P. Counter-Strike. Please put this disgusting atrocity to rest already."

11702,its counter strike 1.6 with zombies and more guns. i dont understand what all the shits about.
11703,i DONT KNOW WHY... but evryone seems to hate on this game... for a 15 year old girl like myself that has no way of earning money... this was areally good Free To Play game
11704,Very bad graphic ! ! !

11715,"I've played this game for 27 hours now, and it's still fun.
The most zombie-modes are boring, except zombie escape.
BUT you can play the original CS, and that's what is makes so good.
There are also other modes that are fun, like gun deathmatch.
So I think you must give it a try!

11718,Good game. If you want CS 1.6 for free this is it.I don't really play the zombie mode (i'm bad at it) but it's like the cs 1.6 if you have a bad PC like mine this is not gonna LAG and the caracthers and weapon texures are better.But if i have 69 FPS on Nvidia GeForce 6150SE nForce 430 and 1.8 GHZ this is a good free CS game.

11735,i like it for a free game. but idk if its just my computer or not. its been lagging. then agian i lost my wireless mouse and is forced to use mouse pad. :(
11736,i was told it was good from others who i know and i liked
11737,Game requires steam to play yet I am launching it through steam.
11738,This game is banging
11739,"Graphics, campers, poor gaming, bad game, in other words, shit"
11740,Worst recoil on the planet of FPS games.
11741,If you're looking troll your friend tell them to download this game
11742,"This game is not worth any of your time. When I first found this game, I was very excited that I could play a counter-strike variant for free, as I have always wanted to play the series. I downloaded the game attempted to play. I was able to access the menu's just fine, but whenever I was loaded into a game, the whole program would crash, resulting in me to perform a hard shutdown on my computer.

Annoyed, I watched some youtube gameplay and found that it really was a shitty game overall. This game is NOT worth your time or bandwidth. This game is only a headache.

Just because a game is free, doesn't mean it's good."
11743,"This actually used to be Counter Strike:Online back in about 2006-2007, which was only available to the asian market (that I beta tested for a while completely lagged as hell).
And about a year ago, they made the sequel, which was Counter Strike:Online 2 (CS:Source for free literally), which has the same basis, but with some adittions like stories, and the ones you see it this.
And from my point of view, I think they should have just skipped the translation and servers for this one and go straight to the CS:O 2 they just made...
Still, this game is 1.6 for free with additional modes, maps, weapons, and characters.
And although it's obviously nothing new, since It's free it's okay to give it a try a couple of times.
"
11744,"It's a fun game but that's mostly because I play original, I've tried the zombie mode out once or twice but it doesn't feel as fun as I thought, your opinion might be different."
11745,"The game is really good even tho its free,  and sens it runs off 1,6 is an little extra bonus. The mods in the game itselfs are really good an few things could be done in and other way but all and all the game fucking funny and awesome"

11748,"Holy crap!
I saw this game at the Steam Market, and decided i'd give it a go.
Little did I know that I would end up getting addicted to it.
Yes. Addicted.
Many complain how this ""modification"" of CS 1.6 is bad. 
Yes, the ghraphics are outdated. So what?! 
Is that all that is supposed to matter? Honestly, this game (especially the Zombie Escape mode) actually gats my heart pumping.
So then, should you get it?
YES. I dont guarantee that you'll like it, but since you got no money to lose, then give this game a go.
Peace."
11749,This game was awesome
11750,"This game is awesome and I really like it, It has gamemodes like FUN, TDM, DM, GDM, GTDM, AND ORIGNAL, ZOMBIE HERO, ZOMBIE SCENARIO, ZOMBIE MUTANT AND OTHER FUN THINGS LIKE HOLY CRAP

11778,Please HELP!!! I open the game and the link pops out a says : Failed to start the driver for hack blocking . HELP PLEASE!!!!!
11779,I think that the game is good but the people that you see saying it suck probably just played for five minutes and were like game sucks un install. If you like fast paced action and good graphics and al that stuff this may not be the game for you. but it is easy to figure out and play
11780,10/10 recommend it to only the most swag loaded mlg quickscopers
11781,"This game is probably the worst Counter-Strike mod. You can't change your graphics, gameplay is really awful. The HUD is really jumbled up and all over the screen and it's really diffucult to find a server with your filterings."

11785,Nice free counter strike game
11786,"Glitchy, low end graphics, bad zombies. I really don't know if they were making a serious game or not."
11787,Plays as listed. Classic CS Zombies.
11788,"This game is supposed to be realistic, right? I could fly to Africa and get more action catching ebola. This game is the worst thing ever created, infact, I deleted system 32 after playing. DO.NOT.DOWNLOAD."
11789,"Well, after going into the review section, I saw alot of bad reviews. So here is my taste:

If you have played Counter Strike 1.6 you will love this game. It has all the classic game modes (Classic, Deathmatch, etc.), all the maps you love, and that classic valve engine. You can spend hours murdering the many noobs who dont know how to switch weapons, and its all a blast. ""But isnt CS 1.6 on Steam?"" you are asking yourself. And yes, it is. BUT that costs money, and this is free. You dont even have to play the Zombie mode, you can just enjoy the game for what it is: Counter Strike. The game we all wasted hours of our lives playing back in the late 90's. So all in all, great game, still fun, and I highly reccomend it.

9/10"
11790,"This is a very good time waster,the only problem is server hosts,AFK people and in some cases (depending on game mode) pay-to-win!
It IS free to play so there is really nothing lost but I don't recommend buying in-game items unless you're into the game.
Go on out and try it out!"
11791,0/5 never play again
11792,"this game is so messed up, they say hackers will be delt with BS, there is so meny using wall hacks (shoot through walls), box hacks ( knowing where everyone is) and immortal hacks oh and 1 hit kill hacks thats common with rifle men that don't know how to use anything else.

snpier rifles need to have less power unless they have the barrett 50 cal the MOST powerful sniper in the world because it was made to take out tanks for the US soldiers on the front line in wars

this game is full and i mean full of cheaters that can't play so they need to cheat.

in real war you can't do this so why do it? (is it because you can't play FPS for soup) if you can't play without cheating don't play (thats my life rule right here)

i feel sorry for the people that want to play coz they wanna play for the sake of putting a bullet in a guys head

this game gets 0 rating from me because this game IS NOT monitered for hackers and cheater i have reported 9 in total and still they remain if i was in charge i wouldn't even prolong there suffering of others and close this bag of crap called a shooter at least CSGO is montiered by real people that play aswell

i wouldn't suggest this game to my enemies or even my friends for that matter its too... whats that word that people use these day oh yeah utter crapola i would rather get ebola than play this crap

also the anti-ban thingy hmm... what a load of crap that is i have been banned from this game for...


GIVING A BAD REVEIW ON THIS GAME

I am a real player that doesn't hack/cheat in any game so who ever made this game needs to get there finger out of there BUTT and fix the game full of hackers and cheats before they ban people for giving bad reviews geeez"
11793,"Not bad.
Well, this is a way better game than i was thinking.
This is good for noobs, but i prefer playing classic CS or CSGO.
Im impressed with rank system, also first round was easy with 3kills and 0 deaths.
CS pros will dominate here(alot of noobs play CSN)
8/10"
11794,"This game is pretty terrible i couldnt recommend it to anyone and it has the worst ""free to play"" system ive seen yet"
11795,Great GAME !!
11796,Don't believe everyone else. It doesn't take up alot of space so try it for yourself. I think its fun and definetely worth it for free to play.
11797,gg
11798,classic is ok... IF you are on the T side. Ct side will get spawn killed. Otherwise a 3/10 game would not reccomend.
11799,"Since it's free, I suggest that you try it out and understand, for yourself, as to why I don't recommend this game.  


But!  For the sake of  ""why.""

I have given it just a bit over 6 hours of play time and it's still hard to even understand anything.
Just like every game Nexon has been involved in... It's just so diluted.  This game just doesn't make any sense.  Keep it simple!  Especially, if it's a zombie game."
11800,Free CS 1.6 + Zombies
11801,"The game sucks dick. It starts lagging after 5 minutes in the game, its not my computer -my other games play amazingly- its the game. Its complete utter shit. Dont waste your time on it"
11802,I like it.
11803,counter strike will not load up for me. Its saying that it is closed for maintance but on the news for counter strike it said counter strike maintance completed
11804,"it is amazing yh baby yh
"
11805,It's could be cool but the game is whery laggy and i can't get out of the first window what is jumped on screen and i can't play the game! Plise send me a letther and tell what can i do! i want to play but the window don't closes if i press ''x'' or ''ok''
11806,"I like the game, but if you play more than 15 minutes you get boring. If you dont add weapons in shop for this long time that`s a minus from me. But please nexon add prophunt mode, i`d will be very fun and i sure i don`t get bored for that mode.But its a nice game, so enjoy it."
11807,The best 30 sec i had befor it closed it self  7/10
11808,"I feel as though this game had potential, but it wasn't used and overall I feel the game had poor design. While I would say if you didn't have 1.6 this could be an alternative given the team deathmatch mode, there are changes in movement and physics that really mess it up. It should have been made in the CS:GO engine for improved graphics and other things (you don't need much to run CS:GO anyway) and I don't think it should really be a standalone game. It is just a mod.

 I played Zombie Escape which involved me following arrows on a map which looked open - but turned out to be very linear, just the same thing every round. It was an ok concept for a game/gamemode, but it lacked any enjoyment for me - and I sometimes found myself stuck in the walls of the map, just waiting for my demise. Then it happened as a zombie, and I couldn't do anything - so I quit the server.

So this review doesn't go on forever, here are my pros and cons about the game:

PROS:

-The game is free so you don't waste any money trying it out (unless you use the microtransactions...)
-Some good concepts for gamemodes which could be improved and expanded upon more 

CONS:

-Some people don't like free to play - so I'm putting that here too. 
-Microtransactons
-COD-Style Levelling 
-Bugs (Stuck in walls, game not starting correctly to name a few)
-Made in the 1.6 engine rather than using something more up-to-date
-Linear arrow following in what could have easily been a more expansive world to play in
-Movement changes from 1.6 make it somewhat unfamiliar to 1.6 players
-Gets repetitve quickly
-It could easily have just been a mod, and some of the gamemodes are probably playable in Gmod
- YOU DON'T MOVE FASTER WITH YOUR KNIFE OUT 

Overall I would say this game is a 4/10 as it's features are rather lackluster. I feel as though Nexon have let us down, as I was somewhat looking forward to this game when I first heard about it. These are just my opinions though, and as the game is free you can try it out if you would like."
11809,"I love this game, amazing gameplay. Poor graphics add nostalgia to those games from like gamecube and stuff."
11810,"seems to be some rendering problems with the GTX 660 Ti and 344.44 drivers

expecting the HD 6970 soon so I will retest the game with that

"
11811,This game is okay for some reason for me the terrorist weapons are inaccurate. Zombies can be OP. I give the game 7.5/10
11812,"Very bad graphics. It is a good game though if you like this game you should get CS:GO. 4/10 graphics and 7/10 Gameplay!

11843,"People on here are just rude,that's why ""I don't Recommend this game."
11844,When i first donwloaded this the crafting/dissasembling/synthesis had better chances to give you stuff and better stuff at that and now it's damn near impossible to get decent shit out of it. they're going to start turning this into pay to win almost...this used to be very great and they fucked up after one of the last updates. Good job you fucking assholes. Going EA on this shit. Cheap as fuck.
11845,"it's really fun
"
11846,It's like regular CS but with bad servers and P2W cosmetics.... I give it Game of the Millennium
11847,A very bad game! Not interesting.
11848,"ive had this game since it came out I even played the Europe version a while back it was fun so I was of course was looking forward to playing this in NA both gameplay and NO LAG lol.. But anywayz, the game worked for a couple days, but since like 3 days ago I can't even finish a game with without it DC'ing me to my desktop, doesn't show an error or anything just pushes me straight to desktop and closes the game, I don't know whats going on, but Im pretty sure im the only one having this problem because the servers are all full. If someone will please get back to me ASAP it will be much apreciated.. (EMAIL)..    razergamer21@outlook.com   Thx -Elite-Salvation-"
11849,"The game itself is very good, I like how it adds some aspects of not only the zombies but also aspects of pvp, players vs. bots. I really dont think there is much else to add to the game, possibly a more clear menu of gamemodes but still overall the game is astounding."
11850,"I remember when this used to be ""Free Counter-Strike but with a zombie mode"""
11851,"I had more fun reading the reviews.....Than playing the game.

Do not get, unless you want ebola."
11852,"Pretty much classic cs1.6 zombie mod, which I really enjoyed so yeah I like this."
11853,IT WAS AWESOME!
11854,FUCK  AMASING!! IT KANT GET ANY WORST THAN THAT THE ANIMATION WERE SO FUCKING AMASING!!!
11855,"this is by far one of the worst games i've ever played. This right here is a total and complete rip-off of the ""Counter-Strike 1.6"" franchise. fuck this game and fuck myself for even attempting to play this shitheap. god rest my soul, amen"
11856,GOOD GAME
11857,Very crappily made. :/

11863,"sry for bad spelling! for all of you mentaly (******) up kids that really like to hate, im here to give you some facts about this game.. just little from i know. This game was made in korea back in  2006 beta then the game was relesed end of 2007  its a pertty old game. iknow, the graphic are bad but i hope you know this game was based on cs 1.6 but added diffrent game modes you can PVE AND PVP .  this game is more for entertainment than competive. Its a free to play game with super low computer requirment i mean.. a super bad dell laptop can run this game... so dont expect god graphics games like Crysis , BF woldenstein or the division. For all of you that never played cs 1.5 1.6 please dont give shet comments saying how bad this game was a legend it was classic."
11864,"No skins.

10/10"
11865,Like counter-strike. but with zombies
11866,"What a pile of shit.

Valve, I hope to GOD that the next releases aren't this bad.
Just develop the game on your own and tell Nexon to go fuck themselves. The thing that sets this game apart from the other GOOD releases is teaming up with Nexon, who are probably the most fucking retarded company I have ever seen.

0/10. ZERO OUT OF TEN. THAT'S HOW BAD THIS IS."
11867,"The gameplay is extremely bland and repetitive, no tutorial that I could find. I guess you don't really need a tutorial for a game that is so simple it is boring."

11875,"Wow, What a piece of Grabage, Laggy as hell, Boring gameplay, Go play Hawken if you want a fast polished shooter.
"
11876,fun game
11877,"This game runs on the ""legendary"" 1.6 engine. This game is laggy even on a PC that easily runs CS:GO. It has too many problems to enjoy. The zombie ""mode"" sucks. If you want to play this, then play. If you want to play competively, then buy other CS games."

11880,i cant even start the game
11881,Very entertaining game. basicly counter strike source for free.
11882,"Honestly this is a good game, I just suffered from occasional buga and it sucks that when you are getting shot you cant move. But this a good team based game, its like CS:1.6 for free and who doesnt love free stuff. 6/10"
11883,is good
11884,This game is great for some one who wishis to play counter strike but cant!
11885,"it's counter strike 1.6 with anime girls and broken P2W guns
what's not to like here?"
11886,"I love this game! Its so fun you can play tdm, gun deathmatch, and other fun gamemodes!"
11887,LOVED IT IT'S AWESOME!!!!!!
11888,I kept it real like ian beal but the beat wasnt goodenough ive got nothing left
11889,"This game has a very narrow target audience, this is why it won't appeal to most CS players. It is targeted mostly towards Counter-Strike 1.6 Zombie Mode fanatics.

If you love playing Zombie Mode in the original CS 1.6, this might be your thing. Keep in mind that Nexon: Zombies is exactly that (CS 1.6 Zombie mode), but with a few improvements:
The game has a lot more MMO-ish design than the original. Thankfully, the gameplay is largely unchanged. The biggest changes are in the UI and in the guns. The game also adds a ton of new Zombie Mode content. We're talking more maps, more modes etc. Unfortunately for some dumb reason, there are only TWO zombie models in the game.

If you don't enjoy CS 1.6 Zombie mode all that much, or just play the original modes, this is definitely not your thing.
Players who play mostly bomb defusal scenarios will be hugely disappointed. There ARE classic bomb defusal and deathmatch modes, but they are just there for the sake of filling up the bullet-points.

Pros:
+ It's Free! AND it's NOT pay to win!
+ Freshens up the old and stale Counter-Strike formula a bit
+ New modes, or addition of modes which were not popular with the original CS. (Zombie escape is my personal favourite)
+ The maps are pretty dynamic for a 16 year old engine.
+ New guns
+ Several UI tweaks...

Cons:
- ...which may alienate some of the hardcore fans.
- The classic modes are a bummer.
- Not much variety in terms of character customization (sprays, skins, etc.)
- Toxic community. Like, League of Legends level of toxicity.
- No modding community AT ALL
- For a game that's primarily focused on zombies, the actual zombies themselves are pretty lame. I remember back in the day there were different types of zombies with different kinds of abilities (jumpers, healers, witches)... Instead, Nexon said ""F*ck all that"" and gave us only TWO (!!!) zombie models.

Potato comparison:
Imagine putting a potato in a cheap microwave for about a minute. When you take it out, some parts of the potato are blazing hot, while others are completely cold. This is what this game is like.

Final score:
6.8/10"
11890,Many people dislike this game. Why shouldn't I follow them?
11891,"Valve pls remove this ripoff from steam, and sue them.."
11892,"questo gioco fa cagare la minchia,le armi fanno cagare e ci sono molti giocatori bastardi negri ''nein nein nein'' che camperano,e quando ti sparano ti si congelano i coglioni e non riesci piu' a muoverti.

maometto:e che maometto in culo?"
11893,"I'm wondering how to contact with game mananger, i got some problems in game."
11894,"Every time I go to play this game one of 2 things will happen. Either the first one is that the levels wind up so choked with zombies that its nearly impossible to get going once you DO spawn, OR the game crashes and you wind up getting stuck with some random message window and no way to close it.  This game is a piece of crap and a total blood boiling waste of time, but hey at least it was free."
11895,Good game !
11896,looks like shit but is very addicting.
11897,"A really enjoyable multi-player game that is fast-paced and of course, includes zombies."
11898,How do i get recipes???
11899,"Great game, had a lot of fun!"
11900,"good game
"
11901,"Awful game, couldnt see anything properly. Tremendous difficulty to find out what im clicking on in the main menu. Completely and utterly rubbish and waste of a downlaod. DO NOT GET THIS GAME"
11902,Unballanced disaster.
11903,So i play it for a bit great game ive never hacked on this game i stop playing for like 3 months come back to being banned by a GM

11907,This game is awful. Feels like a shitty Counter Strike clone with zombies that suck dick.
11908,some good fun here!!!!
11909,It was okay.... But crappy graphics and repetitive stuff.  Play only if you want to kill some time.
11910,"C-S 1.5 was first realistic f.p.s. Guns act as a real weapon would, recoil ,reloading and reduced accuracy while moving..All who say this is a bugged mod have no clue what a real gun is - this was the first gaming engine to enter phsyics of actual guns and how they react when fired and damage according to hit and kevlar/ no kevlar..Zombies a lil o.p. in some scenarios while weak in others...Weapons are best part of this version , many more than original c-s , some from other c-s mods, day of defeat, and half-life, melee weaps. also fun,,weapon crafting easy to do and always fun to be a zombie infecting others..A definite for any C-S fan , a lil wierd to play after modern source version but still One of best free 2 play out there. Have Found myself yelling at comp and then 5 min later laughing hysterically at zombies...Not many games can do that.."

11913,"this game sucks
"
11914,"The game continuously stops responding in between the battle and lobby selection. Also, I played a T/CT game and my team was just being sniped and headshotted throughout the game. make it a little less easy to die maybe? Or Atleast make it so you are invinceble a little longer! They just camped at our spawn waiting for us to come out. Sometimes, they even went in and killed us all. Can you buff up the characters or nerf some of the guns? Just a lot of issues I found and annoying things. I was always the host zombie as well like why? Three, four times in a row? Ha just a ""coincidence"" Yes, I am complaining but still fix this stuff!"
11915,"it says

How do i fix this?"
11916,AWESOME but idont get the division part how to increase your division??>!
11917,"If you like old 1.6 (and maybe the very basic zombie mods) you will like this game also. Movement and so on does feel like Counter-Strike betas though and not like 1.6. Be aware that the graphics are outdated for more then a decade already (new: 1998 -> outdated ~2003 -> now it s 2014).

Has several different mods including, the normal zombie mod you know from 1.6 zombie mod, a survival tower defence style, a mission type scenerio, a run away from zombies and also original 1.6 with all adding some new weapons besides the original 1.6 weapons. 

Because it is for free and 2014 -> 7.5/10 if this had been released 10 years earlier -> 9/10"
11918,"Everyone is complaining about how this game sucks, but their just mad because they suck at it they blame the game for their lack of skill. this game is acully fun-It is a challenge-but it is fun, so try it :)"
11919,5/10 To get those cool guns in the pictures you gotta pay real world money it's a game based on a old mod which now makes you pay for shit all of a sudden but with that in mind it's still a good game because i'm very open minded to games and this ain't as bad as it seems.Update I've played this game for 186 hours and i must say i still fucking love this game soo much fun once you get good weapons and no need to buy weapons from the store just alot of work on missions and crafting to get good weapons or bingo and more and more fun game modes have been recently added and i must say darkness is my favorite overall. To this day i'd give the game a 7/10 yes the game might be a gold engine mod but still fun and highly addicting!

11922,Out of my short time playing it I love it that is why I am installing it again Since my SSD only had 128GB left on it i factory reset my pc I Love This game one problem when you walk by people in rooms you can not walk right by them.
11923,keeps aspecs of the old games but adds in an healthy dose of zeds (sorry for bad spelling)
11924,Very cool game!
11925,"There is really sh#t graphics
"
11926,"This is free and pretty cool game... im not saying this is better than cs1.6 or CS:S... but it's not bad game... you should download this game and try it out!
4/5 :)"
11927,BEST FUCKING GAME EVER <3 :D
11928,It's actually a fun game to play with friends
11929,It's FREE and has Zombies... what more could you want :)
11930,time wasting fun
11931,"I don't undertstand why there is so much hate on this game, i really enjoy it. The reason why i enjoy it is because any computer can play this game and it is free. If your wanting to play Counter Strike and don't have to money to pay for it i recomend this game to the fullest."
11932,"If it aint COD, it ain't right... or so a majority of the negative reviewers tell us.

No, this game does not offer cutting edge graphics, it's based on pre-source models perhaps from CS 5 or earlier. If you're the type of person who focuses soley on cosmetic/aesthetic appearances, then by all means feel free to skip this title.

However, if you find yourself less superficial and you tend to focus more on substance/overall gameplay, then you'll want to check this out.

My 20+ hours of play focus mainly on two specific game modes - Scenerio and Shelter.

'Scenerio' is compromised of endless spawns of zombie hordes while you and your team fight your way through destructible barricades in an attempt to reach your 'lost' team. Once you reach the end of a map, you'll find yourself faced with a huge boss that will take your whole team to bring down (be sure to level [in game] appropriately prior to reaching boss). This a fair amount of variation in map layout, so be sure to try out different maps. This mode is heavily cooperative.

'Shelter' is a crafting style game. You and your team must fortify a shelter by harvesting materials. There are 3 skill trees in this mode - Having 1 player each (assuming you have 3 or more) focus and max out a single skill tree is imperative for your survival. Do your best to understand your skill tree and what role you should be playing and things will run fairly smooth. This mode requires even more cooperation than Secenerio and has the highest learning curve - Fair amount of forward thinking required if you are not playing with someone who has already survived shelter mode. The thinking aspect is a large part of the fun for me, take your time and you'll do fine.

There are a ton of other modes that I haven't played. The other few that I have where essentially 'Team Deathmatches' Zombis vs Humans, etc. For a free title, there's no reason why this game doesn't deserve more attention. Though as seen by reviewers, times are changing and apparently there are more superficial individuals in the world who prefer the same regurgitated slop year after year, rather than having new experiences. To each their own.

Lastly, In the main menu of the game you'll find a ton of stuff to do as well. Craft new weapons for use in game, create or join a family (being in a family can offer perks like bonus XP in game, etc), enhance preexisting weapons, etc. Ultimately there is a lot to this game - Attempt to experience as much as you can before you weigh in as an expert with less than 15 minutes of gameplay. I've yet to experience even half of this game."
11933,Ok first thing I LOVE THIS i dont really play the zombies i like the team deathmatch. I dont see why people are hating this so much its FREE its FREE counter strike its fun END OF STORY.
11934,"it suck ass
"
11935,interesting game
11936,"waste of time, its terrible"
11937,"Really good game. It's not pay to win, you can craft permament weapons (but it's rare) or weapons for couple of months. Zombies in the title aren't the thing i was looking for. Zombie modes aren't better than original :), but i play both."
11938,"Utter rubbish, a fregment of our youths desecrated by nexon. How could Valve let this happen to such a relic?"
11939,"At first glance, you may think this game owns ""Bad Graphics"" or ""Rip-off."" But once you start playing, you get hooked."
11940,"DONT PLAY THIS GAME. WHAT EVER YOU DO, DONT GET IT, IT FUCKING SUCKS."
11941,love the game
11942,"the best part about this game is the uninstall-button.

0/10 - no seriously, i would rather die to cancer than playing this piece of shit."
11943,"Ok honestly, I love it. I remember 5 years ago me and my cousin from china would play this game when i went to China. this game brings back memories, great times and a butt load of fun. make sure to play because there is alot of stuff coming in the future... trust me ;)"
11944,".....i like it.......
"
11945,No amount of showers will ever rid me of the stain this piece of shit left on my soul.
11946,crappest cs mod ive ever played
11947,"Hello, i am about to download CSN:Z and i'm guessing it's super awesome P.S People who say bad things about this game are speaking for their ownself so other people come try this game out and suggest to yourself if it's good!"
11948,"Was Fun till i notice it take way more bullets then needed to put a Zombie down. Unless u have extra cash for old school graphics lame guns that do do damage, give it a try i wont say its bad but its not good."
11949,it sucks
11950,"fun but i was trying to buy something id been on for long time id put a lot of work in and glitched had to close the window devs need to work on it
"
11951,"no but its not THAT bad but if you dont want dont get it its ok in the sence that its different but it isnt that good either
"
11952,peice of shit that will not delete
11953,Its Free Cs 1.6 :D
11954,"Unlike other people i rather enjoy this game, as well as the zombies mode (which comes with: last man standing, defend the shelter and attack the shelter) it also has the original counter strike in it with extra skins and some new maps, for a free game this is great, the only down side is you have to own Counter Strike and it can be a bit laggy, I recommend this game to FPS likers, you dont have to like Counter strike to play this game, the zombies mode is pretty much Left 4 Dead, get this game, Its good fun! :)"
11955,"Worst game ever
"
11956,"Worse.Game.Ever.
Nexon even managed to kill CS 1.6 ..."
11957,"This game can have a lot of fun, but at the same time, it is a pay to win.
I played this game in Taiwan servers for about 2 year, didn't pay any money, but got a lot of fun out of it."
11958,soooo cooollllll
11959,"KOSTA0703 IS THE BEST NEXON PLAYER.  HE IS THE GOD OF THIS GAME, ADD HIM."
11960,The Name change is real. Like the 10th Time wtf
11961,"I dont understand why so many negative reviews .In the beggining , i trusted all negative reviews but then i saw a review ""just try the game if it fits your style"". I tested the game and it's very good.  I like that you have missions , you can craft weapons and it's NOT pay to win."
11962,"Has a lot of those weird things that only Koreans could come up with, so laggy that it becomes impossible to hit anything, even with 40 ms of ping and the framerate is quite low, especially on zombie mode (which is quite cool, shooting hordes of zombis with a LMG is nice... for the first 20 minutes)
Worth trying anyway"
11963,"please i have seen everything now i must end my life because of you...


you stupid game"
11964,i like it but it never lets me play it always disconnects on me :/
11965,Wery cool game its worth it to download
11966,"Shit graphics, poor gunplay, no need to manage cash, lacking audio. good thing it is free to play because I would have been pissed if I had spent money on this piece of crap"
11967,it is wonder full more gamemodes and plus you can play zombies and who dosent like zombies and mutiplayer for pepole that like defult counter strike get it now
11968,Ahahah
11969,"This is actually pretty good, despite  the nonsense and trash people say about it. Is it badly designed in some ways? Yea it is, but that doesn't mean anything. This game has WONDERFUL potential to be better, example would be adding more graphic settings, fixing some hits boxes with the zombies, etc. Just small stuff to work around this. But otherwise i recommend this game to anyone who's a counter strike players and a zombie lover! 8/10"
11970,:|
11971,"OMG Freakin love this game for having all the servers on the other side of world and not ever make me lag. Graphics here have surpassed today stardards with actual shadows and real textures which actually immerse the gamer in the game, which si much better than  that crappy, blocky game minecraft.

Don't make me started on the gameplay.
Many people say this has no originality and it's just a chinese copy of cs. Well you're wrong. This games has ZOMBIES. IT HAS FREAKIN ZOMBIES nothing I had ever seen in my gaming . Zombies here are so realistic with their movement and sounds which to many may find this frightning and might need a diaper to play this.

For game that is free is definitely a must get for all gaming lovers. This is definitly going to my top 10 for the ""best"" game of this generation.

Best 20 minutes of my life..."
11972,bad game
11973,This game is bad ass! anyone that plays CS or CZ will love this you can play all parts gungame /  death match or regular with all the maps including new ones with better graphics.
11974,nooo
11975,killed myself after 4 minutes the other minute was ok
11976,insane but relly funplay this cs game before the others
11977,"DON'T take everyone's word on this game. Try it for yourself before you judge it.

At first I was pretty skeptical myself, reading all the crappy reviews saying how bad this game is, etc etc. After playing my first game I have to admit, I thought it was a deal breaker and I was about to uninstall it. But then I decided to give it another shot, and I actually had a good time! See here's what people are missing.

1.) It's very different than most FPS games. You can't move when you get shot. Accuracy isn't even added into the game, or atleast very little. But that's what makes it more challenging. More fun. More rewarding to get kills. It matters more that you have to be in the right position, and be clicking that motherfucking mouse as fast as you can.

2.) It's got that old Valve half-life engine. Oldish graphics and sounds that make it actually nostalgic for old time gamers. 

3.) You can't take it seriously. I've played my fair share of counterstrike:source and what not. And I have to say I love both now. Both games are enjoyable with a group of friends. In this game, you're more than likely going to get killed by some BS. 

4.) Nothing is permanent, except for some customizations and what not, but it's not solely dependent on players who pay for their equipment. You can still play ""fair"". You can still buy things in the shop that are temporary, but attainable. You can still get kills. So to be fair, no, It's not ""pay to win"". 

All in all, it's glitchy but enjoyable. I mainly play gun deathmatch, (which is essentially gun game in css). Try it out yourself."
11978,oh my god this game makes me wanna end myself with a salty condom
11979,I'd just go to Zombie Panic source It's WAY Better than Nexon Zombies
11980,"First off i do like this game. I like the gameplay and concept of the game. My biggest problem is it crashes A LOT. It might just be my omputer, idk but almost every time I start a game it crashes. Other than that the only problems are minor things like graphics and such. All around it is an ok game other than crashing a lot."
11981,"This is basically 1.6 with zombies. Crafting system, etc. I would recommend this if you can't afford counter strike games, but prepare for noobs to own, as there is shitload of em'. What I like about this game is the female characters teehee."
11982,love it accept the shooting and the other physics have to be improved but still is a good game
11983,"Taking a tried-and-true foundation (Counter-Strike) and adding their own tweaks to personalize the package, the Nexon bunch have made something simple and fun to get in to; not only do you  get the familiar game modes from CS, you also are gifted with a variety of new game modes and maps too.  Add some zombie goodness into the mix topped off with a few other neat game modes / maps - looking at you ""Hidden,"" and your angry Irish sounding, club wielding, invisible fairy killer as a prime example - and you've got the makings of a pretty good evening waster.

The game is certainly not state of the art graphics-wise and that is okay as there are a slew of newer, prettier games to be had.  What this does do, though, is allow those with older machines  a chance to try something ""new."" with little fear of not being able to run it.  Having said that, what is in the game isn't atrocious looking by any stretch.  Dated, maybe, but not horrifically ugly in appearance.

The item crafting stuff, missions and unique flavor of it all, to me, win out over the perceived ""flaws,"" of having not-so-hot graphics.  I can honestly say that I've had some reasonably good fun with this game.

The seeming lack of an in-game tutorial is my only gripe, and odds are I've just not looked hard enough or looked in the right places as I've been too busy trying to kill that damned Irish fairy lately.  I've got a shotgun just for you, mister.

What can I say except, ""try it."""
11984,Not very fun at all.
11985,zomb iffOOOOOOO
11986,"It's good. I'm glad they added original in as well as zombie mode. So, yeah, I'd recommend it."
11987,i love this game
11988,"I totally recommend this game. Theres many gamemodes outside of zombie survival that give any type of FPS player some fun. Its also a really easy game to learn and get good at, I was easily killing people online on my first game. The only thing that isnt awesome is some zombie online play that can get laggy. also theres some bugs but thats pretty normal for most games. overall I really enjoyed playing this."
11989,Worst mod ever for a game.
11990,Super fun zombie game modes and a well put together modification of the normal CS1.6
11991,"Bloody awful i can't even get in the game. It  just freezes in the beginning and doesnt start again. I have to go into taskmanager to close it. Could also be my computer though, my comp sucks fatass dick. I'm talking Rick Ross dick."
11992,"I puked twice from this game. Once from the fact that theres a FREE counterstrike, and secondly the fact that this game is SHIT. That was 55 minutes of my life I'll never get back.."
11993,if you want to play cs 1.6 for free you should play this
11994,A weak meme.
11995,Amazing
11996,"Worst CS ever!!!!!
Played for 5min and it sucked balls.
Don't waste your time with sh*t like that"
11997,"This game is the definition of LOUSY. There is no tutorial on how to use the main page. I spent 20 minutes trying to figure out how to get into a game, then once in I could only spectate. I recommend this game to people who don't mind playing true trash."
11998,"weery good game its cool and am hev minigun
"
11999,this game is quite bad for a cs game is a poor effort and it has graphic like The Original Doom
12000,gooooooooooood my rating 8.2
12001,sucks
12002,it is a good game but the achievements are glitched so you can not get them :(
12003,Even though its free your better off buying CS:Source as it has several other gamemodes and much better graphics also with counterstrike source the zombie mod you can play different maps and use other items this is so bad that i went and pllayed counter strike source and had a much better time i would suggest you buy that instead
12004,"FINALLY!

If you suck in CS:S or CS:GO this is the right game for you, because now you can finally buy skill!
Just go to your mommy and daddy and steal their credit cards and you finally will be good in Counter Strike!

I don't even get how they paid for the real weapon names and the counter strike brand.
Nexon proofing once more that pay to win is a good money making solution."
12005,Could be better.
12006,"While it's good to have thz CS zombie mod with a shit ton load of weapons, it is hardly enjoyable since to have some new cool guns, you either have to pay ( 2 bucks for a random weapon you will only be able to keep 72 days, arr-arr) or to grind like crazy for the same result. Because yes, crafting a weapon that you can be able to keep forever is tedious as hell. 

You have to attend so much this game to get something that it loses all it's fun after a week.

Also, while I understand the game run on an ancient graphic engine, support for 16/9 would at least be a great improvement."
12007,"If you like play games with zombies, survive component, Shoot and play counter Strike I reccomended this game :)."
12008,"xD
"
12009,–°—É–ø–µ—Ä;)
12010,acctally is pretty awesome survival game with friends there also other modes like soccer and etc. i had great time .. dont 0.2 hours played comments fool you that game is not good. i rly loved it and id like to see Prop HUNT Mode <3
12011,"Dumb. CS 1.6 re-textured poorly with horrible sounds and a dumb objective: buy a machine gun, and hold down left click until game stops. Runs poorly as well, and have I have a hex core with 16gb ram. Uninstalling after 10 minutes."
12012,Unplayable. Cnat believe i wasted my time downloading this shit.
12013,Has a chance to be a good game.
12014,Best Nexon game I've played since GunZ.
12015,If you like CS:GO this is fun and refreshing :). I don't like zombies that much so I play competitive 5v5 and casuals. (in this game its called Original mode)
12016,"This game is absolutly fun, I've played for 3 hours straight and it's everything I could have asked for in a countersrike game, this even runs smoother."
12017,"super pay to win lol
10/10"
12018,"You have to pay to become a woman, too realistic... 1/10"
12019,Best Game I've ever played in my life time.
12020,"I used to love this game but when I log-in back to find some of my good old memories, everything and everyone are gone, Nexon deleted them all and claim somekind of ""migration"" bullshit, I feel so empty when I look at this, more than 1500 hours of memories is throwen away along with Nexon's business ethic..."
12021,"Well first off this is my first counter strike game and Id like to say Ill never waste my time on anything under the name of counter strike again. Why? the game refuses to start... either a steam issue or a game issue, idk. Just wasted 2gb and 30 minutes of my time. Id like to give a legit review but I guess the game is designed to be broken from the start."
12022,bad
12023,cat
12024,"This game is literally cancer. 
When you have it it's a constant pain in the ass...
When it's gone it's a huge relief.

-23/10"
12025,"awesome but i wish there were decoder and guns that you can actually buy like mg3 minigun, dual infinity and upgrade events like dual infinity upgrades, combat knife upgrades, predator minigun upgrade like korean one does and more characters. other than that its awesome!"
12026,"Pros-Lots of guns,fun gameplay,funny looking caraecters
cons-bad graphics,done like blood texture and more blood please,SAME BOSS SRRIOUSLY
"
12027,"I don't see why it gets so much hate. The classic modes are solid and the zombie modes are fun. The only thing I don't like is that the announcer for zombie mode has an incredibly annoying voice and keeps saying ''We have been enslaved by the zombies''. Other than that, its just a bit of fun really, runs pretty good. 

P.S. I haven't played a CS game before this, just thought I'd mention."
12028,This is just like CS:S but with zombies
12029,"I really enjoyed the work dome to this game but when I play it, the hackshield keeps on saying ''Its not defined''.(that was 1 week later when it started poping up this message)
I also found that some maps lets you glitch ot of map with the help of another player.
"
12030,"If your a hardcore CS player, I do not recomend this game. If your new to the CS series and you can't afford the games then give this a go. It has CT vs. TR (Which is the original gamemode of CS). This is a crappier version of CS with terrible graphics. But since its free, its fun. The people who can't afford CS will have a lot of fun with this game!"
12031,God awful. The scariest thing about this game is its awfulness
12032,"I used to love this game. It's just that the community is growing worse. Everybody without a premium weapon or who hasn't spent at least 20 quid in the game are called noobs; if you manage to get a kill with a standard weapon in the pvp zombie gamemodes you are either called a hacker or bot; the so called ""pros"" hog all the kills so you cannot level up; although Nexon tried to fix this problem by adding independent Turkish servers; the Europe servers are filled with Turks (I personally don't find this a problem because I can understand Turkish.)

And that pretty much sums it up. Go play Dirty Bomb instead, although it's free it has a nicer community and is NOT Pay to Win."
12033,"gotta be honest this game is a shit looking, shit sounding, pay to win, shitty game and I fail to even imagine why I ever came to the conclusion this game is good. 10/10 would rewrite this review again."
12034,Nice game.
12035,Verry bad game :c Dont waste ur time. Stay stafe :c
12036,"Its a fun game.

12037,This game looks and plays like pacman

"
12046,Good game ;)
12047,"Awesome game !!
"
12048,"failed to initiaze open gl .restart the launcher
"
12049,"It's good because I can't buy the CS 1.6 or Source in the shop but ths games is free w/ zombie mode, and I think this is a really enjoyable game. 



But the graphics can be better, but it's OK."
12050,"I can now say that I have played a zombie game where I could not kill a single zombie. Great job, Nexon."
12051,"hi im from the bottom of the pacific ocean, i met aqua man"
12052,Hmmmmm
12053,"Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is a game that looks like it was made in 2004 and plays a lot like it too
-the sniper is a one shot kill
-the game is not just about zombies in fact there is a deathmatch and classic game type making the name pointless
-Not as good as regular counter-strike
-im not even sure how nexon worked out a deal with valve to make a knock off that sucks this bad
-I honestly watching 2 men watch the history channel would be more fun than downloading this
-2GB download (not really a problem just a waste of space on your computer)
-NO FANSERVICE :( (Sorry for all you thirsty people)
-The crafting system is mehh only allowing you to craft guns for x days depending on one of the items you use to craft it
-The crafting is not needed, you start out with guns, good guns even!
So just go play regular counter strike GO or Source or even the original it would be more fun than waiting the five minutes for this to download and realizing it was a waste of time"
12054,"One of the best zombie games ever, even though the sh*tty graphics its a really fun experience, and its harcore as f*ck! tons of zombies falling from buildings thats awesome!"
12055,"Do yourself a favor and avoid this game, this is not like CounterStrike at all.

   I've played CS:1.6 and CS:CZ which are very good games and worth the asking price. This on the other hand is if you took those two games and mixed them with Battlefield Play4Free, and then took a huge dump on it.
The User Interface is all over the place and can be hard for new players to understand how to use it, and it litters you with all kinds of promotions and ads for items in the game. Although, once you finally understand how to navigate your way through the insane UI, you will quickly find out that it really is just a butchered version of CS:1.6 with micro transactions all over the place. The re-desings of the old CS maps are not all that great, everything feels way larger than it should feel and the new alternate versions of the maps are really nothing special. The audio is also like CS:1.6, only louder and in lower quality, even with all the audio options set to maximum.
  
  Now for the big one, that being the zombie mode. To put it simply... it's very bad. It really feels like nothing more but the original zombie mod from all the other CS games, and dumbed down to it's simplest form. Either, run away from the zombies with no tactics or pre thinking what so ever, or run around shooting the zombies with no tactics or team work what so ever, and the zombie shelter mode is just so boring, with no pun intended, brain dead zombie ai walking around aimlessly while your turrets fill them with holes and send them back to their boring hell where they belong, or to heven if they are lucky enough. 

  Not to mention that this version of CounterStrike has no modding features what so ever, because all the events are actually rooms instead of independent servers. Instead, you choose from a couple main servers depending on your geographical location in real life. Because you know, CounterStrike was never known for all of it's mods and community made game modes it has.(To anyone who doesn't understand, that last sentence was sarcasm.)
I really am trying to find somthing good about to say about this game, other than you can choose from female characters, which is good. But saddly you can only get those if you give them 9.99 USD, which completely destroyed any positives or upcommings for this game.
There are some other things I forgot to mention like crafting and perks, but I have to be honest with you, I really couldn't bare anymore than fourty minutes with this game. Come to think about it, I would have probably have never heard about this game if it weren't for a Youtube I saw while watching a video. I wouldn't have even bothered with it if it weren't for the fact that it was a ""Free to Play"" version of CounterStrike.

  My final words to you are, if you think this is the Free to Play version of CounterStrike that you have been all waiting for, it really isn't, not even close. If you want to play CounterStrike, then buy any of the other CS games there are, but don't waste your time on this. I hate to say it but, this game is a disgrace to the CounterStrike community.

 3/10 not recommended unless you are really looking for a Free to Play First Person Shooter."
12056,H
12057,"It's fun at first, then you find out you have to pay to win. Save the hard drive space for something good like CS:S and don't download this."
12058,"I have only played the zombie game modes, but I've never seen such a deplorable zombie-tagged game. The game is overall frustrating trying to kill zombies, or even killing players with them. Human guns against zombies are like shooting spitballs, but if you get shot, you literally can't even move, especially as a zombie! On top of that, zombie players 1-hit to infect kill and makes it a pain in hole for getting spawn-killed at the first few seconds of the game!  Zombies are as fast as balls and can jump somewhat high, and to me it feels completely unfair since the zombies can instant kill humans. I've spent an hour looking at the zombie gamemodes they feel almost the same except for zombie escape which is still terrible. Honestly, I think I've had more fun playing CSP zombie survival on my school laptop which makes me laugh thinking about it. To conclude, do not install this game because it is a waste of time."
12059,"Review updated from positive to negative after nearly 6 years since I posted original review in which I recommended this game. However, because of a lot of bad things happening with current state of CSN:S (formerly Counter Strike Nexon Zombies), I would like to warn new and old players about this game:

First of all, after spending thousands of dollars and having over 8000 hours on this game I came into conclusion that this game is just not worth the money or the time because of current situation and direction the game is going. Over the years, the game is full of pricey microtransactions (depending on your region) and other pay to win items which are required in order to enjoy the game fully such as newly released weapons, classes locked behind a steep paywall. Of course there are people who will defend this game saying that you can play the game without spending money, which is true but at the same time you will be utterly destroyed by players who own more powerful paid weapons in PVP modes. It's possible to play this game and not spend any money, however a lot of grinding is required in order to obtain most things, just not the latest gear. Most players also tend to abuse in game bugs and exploits and farming rank in order to be on top, and Nexon isn't doing anything about those bugs nor the people abusing them.

Second of all, this game lost significant playerbase due poor choices made by Nexon and because of toxic players ruining other players experience with name calling, racism and just ganging up on players and even resorting to harassment which is against Nexon's Terms of Service, however even when provided evidence against people breaking rules, Nexon does nothing, even when submitting multiple reports of abuse with proof. There are even people who got banned and silenced trying to help report people breaking the rules which is just unacceptable. Nexon isn't known for being a good company, and one can do quick search online about it but it's even worse that their customer support is non-existent, contacting their support can take weeks and not even solve any issue that players might have. 

Overall, I would strongly suggest avoiding this game because it's unfair, time consuming, plagued with bugs, exploiters, griefers, abusers, rank farmers and the game is lacking proper customer support."
12060,This game ain't good.
12061,"el movimiento del mouse se resbala, aglo que en otros juegos no me pasa"
12062,"It is an amazing game but there is to much of a big difficuly spike
"
12063,"Only played this game a bit and its fun, i crashed a lot when i first started playing but now its fine. And i love the charm of the dated graphics"
12064,"In my opinion, this is currently the best F2P FPS game on Steam.
Give it a try, you won't regret it! :-)"
12065,All hail lord janus.
12066,"Love thiS Game

12073,"[h1]The good[/h1]

[b][u]It has a lot of new game modes and weapons[/u][/b] It mainly focuses on zombies, though.

[b][u]You can play CS 1.6 for free![/u][/b] Bots or real people, with new unreal weapons or without them, you choose.

[h1]The bad[/h1]

[b][u]Achievements are too hard[/u][/b] 95% of achievements are achieved by nobody.

[b][u]Cash grab[/u][/b] This game tries to grab as much cash as it can from your wallet. You can play without any problems if you do not spend any money, which is good. For instance, to change your nickname, you need to pay!"
12074,The ui is primitive and you dont know what your doing theres no tutorial. Just not upto the mark. Not a seamless experience. Good maps but.
12075,"It's a very good game if you are a nostalgic of Counter-Strike 1.6 or if you like old FPS, like me.

I like this game, very good and easy to play, +15 game modes, Human, Zombies, guns, what's better ?"
12076,this is yhe worst game i have played. DON'T INSTALL THIS BULL SHIT
12077,Some people may say this is a horrible game because of its graphics guns and voice acting but if you start playing it more and getting more in depth the game just gets better with the wide selection of gun crafting and being able to enhance your weapons to make them have better stats then you can dissasemble guns to get more parts for guns to build better ones not all the guns are from COD if you craft the guns you can get some really op rare guns such as the BULROG-III BULROG-V  BULROG-XI plus more it is amazing how much better this is than 1.6 CS in some ways it remindes me of CS GO Just worse graphics because of the maps and play type.
12078,This is very Retardet shitty game !
12079,"This is a totally rip-off from South Korea. It was originally introduced to china in ca. 2008 (and it's still based on CS 1.6, which could explain its devastating video quality from last century). Because there were too many Chinese playing non-steam (pirate) CS 1.5 / 1.6 back then, from which Valve can't make any profit. Nexon bought the copyright of developing an online mod for CS specially distributed in Asia and made it into a MMO game,  so that the player must pay more or less during the gameplay like unbalanced weapons or items to drive you to ""upgrade"" your character in order to compete others. Now this kind of scam spreads to Europe, I must warn you guys 'cause it will finally cost you money if you get into it (like some of my classmates). I think no one could explain this more clear than a Chinese like me.
"
12080,Football... what else!
12081,"This game sux its like 50 crying babies on the rape train, Get the regualar counter strike or the new one. Firstly GET ANY OTHER COUNTERSTRIKE this one is horrible 0/10 -IGN"
12082,dont listen to the haters gamers dont care about graphics they care about gameplay not graphics if you care about graphics so much go get a 4000p plasma screen it gives cs for free to its regular counter strike and a mode for zombies
12083,Better than the original Counter-Strike 1.6
12084,graphics could use improvement imo i feel as if they could have made the quality more like cs go but it wasnt too shabby so ill give it a 6/10
12085,Its amazing :D
12086,"All these negative reviews....... Yet, this game is in the top 10 most popular ftp gams on steam???? WTF"
12087,"I tought this game will be something "" new "" and special , but ..
But actually it's isn't , kinda simple and silly game to me , how about you guys?"
12088,we need more maps....but it is still a great game.
12089,Not too shabby.
12090,"do not download this game. it is horrilble. and if you are thinking well i'll just see for myself DON'T. this game does not have zombies that are fun, nor multiplayer that is fun.  you can't shoot anything more than a few feet in front of you because the spread its freaking ludicrous, the zombies are impossible to survive unless you are able to get onto of one way up places, and it will glitch for no reason. if you are thinking about playing this game, don't, just don't. even if you just want to see if its good, it isn't."
12091,"Was pretty excited about playing this game look interesting to play, sadly thats all the good things I can say about it. All the free stuff you get only last for a couple of days and everything else you have to pay for. There are games out there that does a better job then this."
12092,"Awesome game, Cs 1.6 bored me to death with constant spawnkilling and cheaters + the Russians and high skill cap is retarded compared to this game.
Now..this game is like a starter's edition for noobs like me who haven't played Cs 1.6 24/7 or something like that.
So i'll give the pros and cons to make this short.
Pros:
-Better textures and graphics slightly better
-More maps
-More weapons
-Only skins are pay2win but i don't care at least you can't buy S grade weapons for money or something like that cuz the weapons are always random when crafting.
-More new players like me and fun to play with them.
-No microphone spammers
-No cheaters
-Cool modes like ""Zombie shelter"" and ""FUN"" which hype me up to play with friends.
-""Family"" (Clan) system.
-Ranking system.
-Crafting,Synthesize,Disassemble,Enhancement systems.
Cons:Some problems with fps lag on certain modes, for example:My friend played Zombie Shelter and had intense lag and couldn't do anything without looking at the ground inside the main shelter...hasn't found a fix yet, it's really weird.
I recommend this game to many players newbies and veterans alike, cuz this is the improved version of Counter Strike in my opinion."
12093,Very disappointed :(
12094,CS 1.6 F2P
12095,Cool i like it really much
12096,very good
12097,get rekt nexon
12098,it has a very good game play but it does need more work on graphics.
12099,"D√©√ßus, tout simplement, le jeu a enti√®rement changer je ne le reconnais plus du tout, tout √† √©t√© mis √† profit d'un genre qui n'int√©resse r√©element pas grand monde, le pire dans tout √ßa c'est que j'ai perdu ma progression de 300h, et que je n'ai aucun moyen de r√©cup√©r√© mon compte, je ne le recommande donc plus."
12100,"i've tried two different mouses on this game and i still keep drifting, how do i fix it"
12101,NO REASON
12102,"It's simply a pay2win version of CS 1.6 Zombie mode.
A pretty bad one."
12103,cool
12104,This game had a lot of potential but the servers are never up and when they are it is laggy as hell and the game is almost unplayable
12105,[strike] Terrible [/strike] Great Game!
12106,Great for uninstalling
12107,I like the game and the microtranstactions arent that bad well at least isnt like CS GO where a knife cost more than a 12pack beer lol. Waiting for further updates
12108,I think this game has a look of CS:S and CS:Condition Zero I think a Free to Play CS:S is what this is with Zombies added on.
12109,6.7/10 It's a time killer
12110,really cool game this is one of the best first person shooter game ive ever played.
12111,I'd rather eat a bar of soap than play this game.
12112,"Honestly I thought it would resemble CoD Zombies, but no it was a very cheap copy."
12113,"This game was one that i actually looked forward to since i love counter-strike and enjoy similar games. but once it was downloaded i played a few different matches for a total of twenty minutes and could not even bring myself to continue. to start the zombies are over powered and kill the humans within three minutes no matter what, unless the humans glitch on structures and fend them off for two more minutes, the weapons do near zero damage unless you have fifteen people shooting one zombie. it has no looking down sights. if i didn't know better i would say they took gmod and slapped in counter-strike ones resources in with the stock zombie sounds, nerfed guns and released it as a free to play micro transaction piece of arse."
12114,"This game is not as bad as everyone says, it is an all around great game with no required purchases and best of all its FREE"
12115,No interest in this game at all!
12116,It is a nice game if you like Counter Strike Series.
12117,Just awesome to have so many game modes in one counter-strike game
12118,Small resolution!!
12119,"this game sucks
pls return 2014."

12128,"Horrible, horrible game. Proof that you get nothing for free, this game is truly nothing."
12129,"Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is dissapointing.

PROS:
 - Updated Graphics
 - More guns
 - Survival Mode

CONS:
 - Unbalanced Zombie mode
 - Pay 2 win
 - Time consuming

OVERVIEW:
     CSN: Zombies just doesn't live up. I can't tell if this game is trying to be a Call of Duty rip-off or not. Dead serious. In CSNZ, you can partake in multiple gamemodes that you feel you want to play. There's Original, which is basic CS 1.6. There's different kinds of Zombie modes, but I only played one. I had a huge problem with this Zombie mode. It is WAY too unbalanced. A CT has 100 HP, and can be turned into a Zombie in 1 hit. A Zombie has 2000 HP (with the exception of the 7000 HP host zombie) and can take a LONG time to kill. This game is a grindfest. I only won 2 rounds as Humans due to hiding. The last mode I want to talk about is Survival. This game should have never been called Zombies. It should've been about this Survival mode, because it is the best thing in this game and the only reason i'd go back to play (besides playing with new guns in Original mode). In Survival mode, it's purely you and your teammates and whatever cash you can scavenge. Waves of different kinds of HUMAN enemies will try to kill you. Regular gunmen, big ass armored soldiers with miniguns, Survival has it all, including a Boss battle at the end of each one. As you kill more and more soldiers you can buy bigger and better guns and equipment. Survival missions technically have a story line, but you will be more inveloped in the gameplay than someone who only gives lines during the middles of waves. It can become really chaotic and what balances this factor out is a super quick regeneration system. It's just like CoD. Hide back and wait, but it only takes a couple of seconds. Normally, this kind of thing doesn't go good in my book. I've always thought regenerating health as a character was kind of a cheat. The way I prefer it is how it works as a pickup in Quake. But it works with Survival mode. It fits right in and makes the mode so much more fun.

Now that i'm done with the gamemodes. Let's move on to the rest of the game. There is a shop to buy things with your points you've collceted for either playing for an extended amount of time or for completing a mission or match. Now this isn't a problem. You may want to buy new guns with these points. Oh wait. YOU CAN't. THERE ARE NO SINGLE GUNS LISTED IN THE SHOP. ONLY THING AVAILABLE IS WEAPON PACKAGES THAT COST REAL USD. I can't overexagerate how stupid companies are when they place a pay 2 win system in their games. And these guns can be seriously overpowered in some matches. It really shows that games like these don't care about your experience, but your money.

Let me explain my overall gameplay feeling. I can't enjoy Zombie mode, so i'm gonna skip that. Original mode is actually not all that bad. At first I was confused, but it was a quick adjustment. I think Original mode allows for players to pick up new guns they bought and try to test them against other players, to see if it was really worth the purchase. You can play on all the old CS 1.6 maps, including dust2 and italy, And with the game's updated player graphics, it actually feels really nice. Survival mode is amazingly fun and the only reason you should actually sit down and play this game.

I don't recommend this game. Only because of it's poor Zombies mode, which is how the game was advertised, and because of the Pay2Win system. If this game got rid of some things, it'd be a fun addition to the CS series, but I can't find all my fun in it. Yes, Survival is great and all, but that doesn't mean i'm gonna sit there 24/7 gunning down massive waves of enemies. Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies tries it's best to fit in with the rest of the franchise, but some factors just kick it to the curb.

*UPDATE* (As of 10/26/14)
I've read peoples messages, comments, etc. And all I keep finding is the complaint of needing to play for more than an hour before writing a review. First off, I played a good 50 minutes. Sorry if I was 10 away from the 1 hour mark. Second, I don't remember the point where playtime resulted in a fun game. If there are so many reviews on this game, with low playtime, wouldn't that hint you that it wasn't an overall enjoyable experience, causing us to put down the game?

I'm still sticking with all my points. I really don't see any reason to change what I feel about them. The game dissapointed me, so I only sat through 50 minutes of it. I have more fun playing L4D2 than this."

12132,"Lmao, Well what can I say besides this game is utter crap. Back in the 80's to maybe early 90's this might of been a fun game but even for a free game this is pretty much on the bottom of the list with zombie shooters.. 0/10"
12133,"Do I get the time back I wasted playing on this game?
...
No?
Oh :("
12134,every time i tryied to find cs with more weapons and finally here it is yay
12135,tocisemi vurt dokola
12136,Good Game :)
12137,"1/10 EXACTLY LIKE CS1.6 ONLY. there are some ""game modes"" i found there is no support for Australian servers, you have 300+ ping if you don't like in a specific country, No server support in your area no good games...
If you ask me, you're better off paying 20 bucks for csgo and cs1.6 together then just playing either whichever you fancy, and having more enjoyment rather than raging about 400 constant ping and dying from people invisible to you..
I would stick around and play it more but it's honestly just a carbon copy of cs1.6 with some added ""Modes"" or if you think about it, they are already pre created ""mods"" by community players that just have been revamped.. i recommend if you're going to go all out and make a game like this..... do it right...
Next time work on it a bit harder and don't just change models and rebrand it as a new game.. 
I personally would not like to see this game played anymore because it's bringing the attention away from cs1.6 where the community servers are actually supported in every country.. also, its kind of copying the battlefield join game system... GJ... Thanks for the wasted download....."
12138,Fun game if you're looking for something to mess around on.
12139,Pretty cool that I can play this game for free even after my account has been goldsource VAC banned for almost 8 years now!
12140,This Game just shouldnt be a thing. It's just Combat Arms but zombies with CS:GO weapons for the most part.....I do not recommend this game at all what so ever
12141,It crashed when I tried to enter my name. . .
12142,The best FPS for uninstalling.
12143,Its good for a free game. it has the normal free game stuff like micro-trans but its like a free cs
12144,"If you enjoy classic cs1.6, then try this game, all characters are from cs1.6, and the only way you can get weapon is craft by youself, no permanency weapon.The connection problem made my mad, this game should called: Counter-Strike Nexon:connection terminated! The only time i enjoy this game was the time i uninstall it!!!!

12145,Its a prtty fun game not the best but not the worst could they could update the graphics and the servers could be alot better. Modes like team death match and original are really fun. But most of the zombies are not as fun. Hopefully the they fix some these flaws. I will give this game 3 stars
12146,Worst game ever.
12147,Really wanted to play the game but it won't work. The menu with the servers come up and when i choose a server and then a game to play it loads then just quits automatically!!!! WTF IS GOING ON!!! Seriously is there a solution to this error coz i really wanna play this game as i am a huge counter strike fan but until now a massive dissapointment valve. :'(
12148,Its one of my favorite first person shooters and now they put zombies in it?!?! 10/10

12152,"The game itself is good, its partly the original CS and partly CS:S. However, the system used to create and join games is very complex and I had extreme difficulty joining games as well as creating my own, private ones. So its alright if you dont own the original CS, but if you do, then play that."
12153,Best Free2play Game!
12154,this is the best shooter ina while! (with the old type of counter strike)
12155,LOVE THIS GAME AND ITS FREE  !!!!
12156,amazing!
12157,"A very good game it s like counter strike 1.6 but is with zombies(who didint love counter strike 1.6),But the graphics... :/"
12158,"I think this game might actually have the WORST interface i've ever seen
it was enough to make me uninstall
-10/10"
12159,"Downloaded game. Launched, at first it said I don't have steam when I launched it from Steam, it closed the game.

Then I reset steam, told me I was hacking, it closed the game.

10/10, didn't get to play it."
12160,worst fps i've seen in a long time
12161,"Like games recomende for you mode in zombie gun origin
"
12162,"i love this game!!!!!!!!!!!
:crate:"
12163,I like this game. Its just a polished  cs 1.6 with zombies.  Quite fun.
12164,fucking stupid game
12165,"Same as 1.6 but with added features(crafting,leveling,rankings,missions)All old modes like zombies escape etc were in 1.6 already as mods.Who cares,this game is for free you dont need to download maps,stupid sounds like in 1.6. Stop whining kids.It's not p2w either there are only crafting materials and new characters for real money in game store xD.I like this game,feels like old counter-strike plus it has additions like new weapons,which is simply cool.Of course not all aspects of the game are so good,like wierd game modes.Solution:dont play 'em.If you dont like it,play cs 1.6 on level 5 steam account with 3000 hrs on record because you dont have any other games xD"
12166,zombies are cute
12167,I like this zombie mod :)
12168,"It's cool, old school CS Engine. Basic gameplay.
Has its moments but some things are harder to figure out. Uses in-game real money purchases."
12169,"Guys i need help.I downloaded game but when i want to play it it say: ,,This game need steam"" and i have it.Please help.
"
12170,If u have a lots of money...
12171,"This game was a waste of time, i hit red boxes for 90 mins for a 3 min boss fight. the best part of the game for me was seeing a box i didnt have to destroy. I came back to this game today, it sucked still. couldnt find any of the stuff they gave me, and i was confused"
12172,So i played this game again after recovering from its amazingness and all I can say is that i feel like the game has gotten better and learned how to be better.... like a velocoraptor. The only negetive thing I could think of is that Tommy Vercetti is to over powered in multiplayer it really isn't fair when you play as him they should really fix that.
12173,Its a fun game if your a fan of the Counter Strike Universe and has plenty of variety of modes and maps. yes it has its bugs but its nothing that cannot be fixed.
12174,unplayible D:
12175,It sucks so much dick
12176,"Pros:
+CS for free!
+Menu navigation
+Fem models
Cons:
-Female models do NOT have boob physics
-Is ten fucking dollars that much for counter strike?
-Pay 4 more guns
-Pay 4 models
-All you do in the zombie missions are destroying barricade
-You have to re-enter your name when creating tag name
-Is just based on ONE mod you can download ON THE INTERNET OR AUTO-DOWNLOAD.
-Zombie events take too long to complete.
-The menu isnt even needed.
-Only 4 fucking models for zombies."

12178,"I can now say that I have played a zombie game where I could not kill a single zombie. Great job, Nexon."
12179,This games worse than getting cancer.
12180,cool never played the zombies in this game though i play original :D
12181,"Yeah...no thanks.  I'm all for nostalgia, but if I want to play DOOM, the first one, I'll go play DOOM..."
12182,Not even once. Basically CS 1.6 zombie mod with p2w transactions.
12183,"This game  to me is fun but better with friends
"
12184,"i don't see all the negative hate this game gets, yeah it has micro transactions so what? the game is still playable all that the store offers are some skins,points,blueprints,and durables which doesn't seem so bad. other than that you can just use the in game money to buy the other items. The start up menu is a tad wierd but not really that bad at all going just a little but under my monitor. Once the real game starts it fixes and there are different modes to choose from such as zombie scenario,hero,defense. yeah it's an old engine but that just helps the people out who can't really afford a nice computer. overall yeah this game could be better but it still doesn't deserve all the hate it gets. Score: 7/10"
12185,So fun i highly recommend this game to everyone.
12186,Wonky as all hell
12187,Sooo bad. Just so bad.
12188,"Terrible, terrible game. No fun to play at all"

12191,the horde mode is not challenging at all like holding the fire button for 40 minutes
12192,"Its fun, and I like to go and kill zombies with firends, but it may get boring after a bit, I dont know."
12193,"so stupid, so retarded, so i prefer not to play this shitty game"
12194,"Honestly, This game is not as good as the others i have played but hey it is a great game you should really get it."
12195,Kill zombies... what more could you want
12196,"if you really have no money, go play crossfire"
12197,"I dont see why this gets so much hate. Sure its not the best, but its not as bad as some reviews make it.."
12198,"I've absolutely enjoyed ! 9/10 ! As an advanced, experienced CS player. a lover of smashing zombies or other players I can say it's the thing I've been looking for years. An AMAZING MMOFPS with smashing everything around, using FIRE BUTTON all the time. CSNZ if u would have better graphics (like in CS:GO) it would be 12/10 <3"

12206,"It'd be a cool game if it actually worked. 

I've tried two or three times now to play it, verifying the cache and getting all the missing files, and for some reason, every time I join a game, it loads only one frame and then crashes. Every time. Regardless if I've reinstalled."
12207,these zombie modes are readily available in source and global offensive which are realitivly inexpensive.. the only difference being those arnt pay to win.
12208,the graphics are interesting...

12213,"For some reason the game won't start for me, it says that the servers are down for maintence but its been like that for the past threw days, help please"
12214,"Game for retards, dont waist your time! Stupid shit"
12215,"Ok,ok.... game is bad with graphics and there isnt much to do you say....but i say when its really cool cause its FREE TO PLAY!!! GOSH PEOPLE are you really getting mad on free game? did you waste like 10-20$ on this game? i think not because i wasted 0$,still play it and i wait for updates because this game is in early stage"

12219,"Never ever! Low graphics, zero experience, cod zombie copy."
12220,Its a pretty fun game i like to play it :)
12221,"Spent a little less than an hour navigating the menu and playing a few matches of the Zombie and classic CS maps. I don't normally review games, but there was nothing wrong with classics CS or the zombie maps. What was a problem was the weapon modding/leveling system. I spent a quick hundred thousand on enhancement materials and after 60 some odd ""enhancements"" I levelled up my starting rifle about 19 times but deleveled it (Lost upgrade points) 16 times of the 5 dozen or so attempts to level it up. So it had 2 pts in Port and 1 in accuracy. Yeah, no. I'm not gonna waste time with this."
12222,Gives me motion sickness

12232,Great game
12233,if you enjoy playing n64 graphics and just horrible gameplay from paralyzed 6 years who made this piece of garbage than this game is for you.. its 2014 and my left testicle is more enjoyable than this game. dont listen to positive reviews cause this game sucks harder than a homosexual man. i had a better time downloading this game than playing it.
12234,"Where do I start? 

Cons
-Guns are pretty much useless since zombies have 4000 HEALTH!
-The zombies health is way to high. Same goes for humans. Zombies have 4000 health. Humans have 1000 health.
-For some reason getting hit once by a zombie is an instant kill.
-Guns have a TON of knockback and slow you down when you get hit.
-Voice acting is terrible. When a crate drops you hear someone say something like ""Crate Dropped"" I don't know. I can't hear a word he says.
-Map's are just old CounterStrike 1.6 maps accept with a different skybox and it makes the map look really odd and out of place.

Pros
I honestly don't know what to put here. I can't really think of anything.

I give this a 1/10. I suggest just moving on from this page. It's for sure not worth a 2 Hour+ download."
12235,"Awful game.
You'd think it'd be good, like DI: Riptide, which was mediocre, but still playable.
This is not the case with this game.
Confusing interface, pay to win features, and even after all the patches my connection is terminated.

ive played some terible games to


listen, i played only not even .1 of an hour of this game and already hate it with a pasion. I had opened the game, and i could even do andything with the options, couldnt even change it to fullscreen, and there was no graphics options, and there was only 1024- whatever as the top resolution. 


ABSOLUTLEY TERRIBLE, would rate a -420/10000000

its that bad

and i even tried smoking alot of weed on the process to make the game seem better, but still waz absolutley terrible

DON'T PUT THIS IN YOUR STEAM LIBRARY, EVEN IF IT IS FREE."
12239,"game looks like its made for n64, cant play fullscreen only windowed crap and graphics are terrible at best
"
12240,"I don't care what any of you say, this game is fun and addictive. It's fast-paced zombie slaying action at its near finest! Maybe not as polished as Left 4 Dead 2, but still fun.

And for all of you complaining ""lawl this gayum iz 2 ptw"", you don't HAVE to buy anything, and it doesn't effect the game at all.

So yes, I highly, highly recommend this game. Don't let anyone else tell you differently!

Just ignore the haters, don't listen to them, and try the game for yourself."

12244,Never again. Waited for this game for plenty of time now. Amazing if it was released sometime after 1.6 but. Now it's crap
12245,"This game is really hard to play. Even CS:P is better than this.
"
12246,"Ok, where to start...
Well starting this is quite possibly the worst game I've ever played and its buggy as hell. Graphics are from CS 1.6 so it looks terrible but runs good on a potato with a screen stuck in it, running on the power source of a toaster. I mean seriously you cant focus on the graphics?! I've seen Facebook games with better graphics! It's CS zombie mode with Nexon slapped on it, btw if you have ever played a Nexon game and you dont like p2w, DO NOT! Secondly it's EXTREME P2W. Textures are horrible, guns are like they are from a COD game, voice acting stolen from 10 year old prirated B-movies, and AI mapping that will completly screw you over with a spoon. PLUS this is the ultimate UNINSTAL SIM 2014 -1000/1 not even worth the *Free* download."
12247,...
12248,P2W
12249,Did't work. Not the slightest idea why
12250,Hard to get used to but very fun
12251,AWESOME THUMBS UP!
12252,Did you enjoy zombie mode back in the Counter-Strike 1.6 days? Then you will enjoy this.
12253,Nice game
12254,"Valve, you published this piece of shit? My god. Okay, it runs on the goldsource engine. I'm fine with that. However, what I am not fine with is a crappy UI, a fucking abismal graphics which consists of - Dark level that was blaintantly copied from 1.6. The amount of effort this game must have taken is minimal. Not to mention the F2P model that is a money grabbing piece of fuck. Nexon, sort your fucking act out and put some effort into the game instead of a re-skin of 1.6. Honest review - 2/10"
12255,"this game is too GOOD but consume so much rams :(
"
12256,"It started by crashing for the first few times, which considering the grapics is ridiculous. The matchmaking is horrible, and the gameplay is pointless and repetitive. I love Counter Strike, and zombie themed games, but this one was a great letdown for me."
12257,It's awful!!
12258,"Counter-strike 1.6 with a few new graphics, skins and modes to play... Take a look it's free!!!"

12273,I didn't enjoy this game at all and im a real zombie lover (I mean killing them) :P. To much lag my Laptop isn't the best but it works with most games. Also doesn't or didn't show me any training or how to play the different game types! Other then that I haven't played it much because I didn't enjoy it. Other may enjoy it but i certainly did not.
12274,Just.. don't.
12275,"This game makes me wish there was a sideways thumb because this game wasnt good nor was it terrible. It just didnt have that feeling of all the other counter-strikes, i would give this game a 5.5 out of 10"
12276,The graphics are not the best but the acctual game play and modes are great. Unlike most free games they dont force you to pay to be good everything can be done for free. The whole idea in general is good and its great thats its free. When you start you get a massive selection of weapons and gear and the higher levels are not to OP against you. Yet as i have said the graphics do need a bit of work.
12277,Crap! shame for CS in title! greetz :*
12278,"OMG is it really that bad?
Yes it‚Äôs truly awful, without a doubt the worst game I have had the misfortune to play this year.
Just putting the name ‚ÄúCounterstrike‚Äù in will not make it a good game.
I‚Äôve played better looking games on a sega mega drive
Free shold not = garbage :(

12279,weak game
12280,not bad

12282,"why the game close until 5 minutes?? it's a good game, but fix this bug pls"
12283,people who play this game just because they cant afford csgo.
12284,Dont even download this its a compele waste of time.
12285,"I honestly wasn‚Äôt expecting much from this free-to-play title from Nexon but I‚Äôve been pleasantly surprised.

The graphics aren‚Äôt anything spectacular (like CS 1.6 obviously) but the gameplay has been lots of fun. There are several varied game modes and dozens of maps, which is enough to keep me happy for a long time.

The game seems to be hacker free so far and there‚Äôs lots of players online. Worth a try definitely!

Score: 8/10

12290,"This game has potential. It plays pretty decent and has a lot of severs.Just none in australia so if they add that then i think that they can get a lot more feed back from the community and such.
But it's a really fun game that has a lot of gamemodes that make it interesting."
12291,At least its free
12292,PvP in this game is so broken.
12293,"I think I lost more brain cells from playing this then, Charlie Sheen when he does coke."
12294,Good job remaking the original counter-strike. Zombie mode is fun but takes Forever to complete a level. But still good none the less.
12295,graphics as bad as games from the 90s
12296,"I knew there would be problems from the start.

I thought it couldn't possibly be that bad.

I was so.. so wrong.

I knew there would be problems right as I hit ""play."" The game took 4 minutes to download all its crap (even though I have CS1.6) and still had a shitty interface. I thought maybe I could get past that.

Also, I never saw a single ""Join Server"" option ANYWHERE. Good luck, arseholes!

As soon as I got into one, I heard the lovely sound of a 6 year old barking orders at me. Our team lost in less than 20 seconds.

I'm not going to be fooled again, Nexon. Keep your goddamn hands off the Counter-Strike series."
12297,its like eating chocolate when you think its going to taste amazing but then it turns out that it is a log of alpaca black tar heorin when you eat it
12298,THE WORST GAME I EVER PLAY IN MY LIFE
12299,"the gameplay is almost the exact same as 1.6, but theres more features such as clans, crafting, and an official zombies mode. the only thing that sucks is that there arent any dedicated servers. scoping with the awp has ~0.5 second delay and its kinda impossible. when youre joining a lobby all the playes suck, making it likely that this is their first counter strike game. one thing i dont like about it are the new weapons; sure they look cool but they dont fit in with the counter stike groove. overall, nexon did a solid job on reviving the counter strike legacy. they left most original features untouched, such as the ""original"" gamemode. original is basically legacy counter strike, and because of that, is why i play this more than 1.6. here its easier to create an organized clan, and to get up to the competitive ladder instead of having to spend money on esea, cevo, or altpug. as ive mentioned before, this game does a good job of keeping the counter strike legacy alive, and may be a good ""starter"" edition of counter strike for new players. if youre new, this is a fun and competitive game. if youre a veteran, this is still a fun and competitive game. overrall, id recommend it to newcomers who want to get more familiar with the counter strike franchise, and to hardcore veterans who want to refresh their experience with 1.6. 

7.5/10 not bad, not great, but good.


GOOD
----------
-original gamemode
-competitive aspect (ladders and such)
-relatively untouched gameplay (original, weapon and movement mechanics
-almost untouched original maps (dust2, nuke, inferno)

BAD
-----------
-bland crafting system
-low skilled players (in general)
-zombie gamemode (poor ai boring game mechanics boring maps)

-new weapons (can be more overpowerd than the classic ones)"
12300,i feel that this game has alot of potential just upgrade to unreal engine and this game will be 9/11.4 so don't worry about all of the haters and shit cause i believe in this game and just keep being yous guys
12301,The fail in this game is like enormous.
12302,FUCK THE ZOMBIES! BUT ITS A FREE COPY OF 1.6 SO PICK THIS UP!!
12303,stupid stupid game very big let down from what you would think it would be.....uninstall comign right up
12304,"its a copy of counter strike 1.6. 
 hey i didnt say counter strike 1.6 is bad did i.


also the zombie mode is ok,but no one said there had to be zombies so the fact that it has it is pretty cool."
12305,"By nexon company standarts this would be pretty good,since they don't do anything special."
12306,1 map....... all that needs to be said...
12307,Not nice game.
12308,Still better than Dota 2!
12309,The 1 word that best describes Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies ------>HORRIBLE<------
12310,For some reason that is making me fustrated is that my game keeps saying it cant connect to the server. I played the game just last night and now it's not working. Again. It wasn't before that. It's a good game if it actually worked.
12311,"This game is not really that fun. I did not enjoy my time here and it was to much reading for the time spent in the game.

I simply can not see this games potensial.

0.1/10"
12312,"Please do not download this game !!
Its a shame for the Counter-Strike franchise :(
Please take this game off from steam"
12313,nonono
12314,"Don't know why this game lags as hell when human, but runs smooth while zambie"
12315,"So i played this game about 1.5 hours killed 1400-1500 zombies reached level 74-78. There is like 8 different types of zombies and ¬Ω of them are rare which you prob see couple times/hour. 

Started Co-op 2man with my friend it took us like 10 minutes to clear the 1 wave of zombies and then we shot like another 10 minutes of boxes with 30-40k hp (Knife hit 3 damage). There is no reason to use any other weapon than B->5->1 which has 100 ammo on clip.

Basically all you do is shoot same zombies & boxes until you get brain cancer.

Secondly i got like 400k coins at start LIKE WTF SHOULD I BUY 400 ressurections to some map. They are giving coins because this game is what it is!

Do not recommend: -11/10"
12316,"Counter Strike and nexon...together.
This is really not good so i also enjoyed more when i was downloading game"
12317,This game is just trash
12318,"I have played with Nexon before, and while they did do well with Maplestory, they did not quiet... no, lets say they failed to nail anything in the proper place here. I would normaly put a long review here, but even with only the 5 hours in play, I dont find any good reason to keep playing aside from the overpowered weapons (really? a revolver with a scope on it that one-hits everything?) and the strange feeling of addiction you get from it.

All in all, I can say 2/10. Stick with the original Maplestory, Nexon."
12319,what
12320,The trailer is about the only thing cool about it. Beween the doom style graphics and the hard to navigate menu's while in a match this game is a big NO GO for me. It lacks the smooth transitions and much of the maps are just bad copies of Csgo.. o.o my advice. Get CSGO... its much easier and not nearly as annoying.
12321,"HEAPS GOOD
"
12322,"Good Game
Counter Strike GO is still better"
12323,"It's 2014
just.... no...."
12324,NO just NO
12325,"asta pare sa fie Counter-Strike 1.6 GRATUIT :)
Numele jocului produce confuzie, nu e doar cu zombie, contine si modul original!
E interesant si sistemul de servere, pe room-uri, nu sistem clasic de servere dedicate.
Perfect pentru jocuri/meciuri cu prietenii, parerea mea!"
12326,"The game can't run in 16:9 widescreen. It can't run full screen. It can't go higher than 1024x769. It wouldn't let me use the name ""Dogman15"". (Because it has ""gman"" in it? I don't know.) I don't know how to play with bots or play ""today's mission"". The menus and GUI are confusing. I tried connecting to a server in North America and it failed. This game has failed me."
12327,"This game destroyed whatever was remaining of my soul, there is no place to start with how terrible it was. I'm not sure if I should address the horrible interface, gameplay, and overall concept, or the fact that this game was probably made inside a dormant volcano on an island used for a toxic waste dump. I was scarred forever after one ""match"" I use the term match lightly because I had no idea what was occuring, other than I was mindlessly running about in a box with worse graphics than a windows 95 screen saver, and wretched, shameful attempts at gunshot audio constantly blaring. Taping 'Counter-Strike"" into the title makes me scared to play Counter-Strike ever again, not because it had anything to do with this disgrace, but because I may have flashbacks to the nightmarish experience I sat through with this.

This game should have an achievement for being able to spend more that 25 seconds in the main menu, Forget free to play, they should have to pay the user to play this game.

You uninstall button will scream for use, your hard drive will cry in pain every moment this game remains on it. Do the right thing."
12328,why does every hate this game so much if u looking for a zombie game low graphice pull then this ur game yes its in beta but thats why there are things called patches the help the game this game is fun and additcting so enjoy some fun play with freind and always kick some zombie but
12329,"Pros:
Classic 1.6 and many different modes
Many new weapons and character models
Tons of PvE and PvP

Cons:
Menu UI
Balancing issues
Minor details to certain game modes (More detail below)

I feel this game is a great addition to the CS games, it not only has the original CS1.6 mode, but has tons of new weapons that you can craft and many different multiplayer modes to chose from and some great CO-OP. Though not as fun alone, when you have these people called ""friends"" it makes for a great experience. Though yes some improvements can be made, such as a round start timer for the original mode (I haven't seen one myself), less structure health on Tracking mode,  the hidden should be more like source, where he remains only slightly visible and you have to watch for certain things to find him, and plus no respawns in that mode (Reason I mention the hidden stuff there is because it makes it way to fast pace). Anyways thats my 2 cents on this game. Play for yourself, everyones opinion is there own... even if its wrong :D

I forgot to mention that the Menu UI is terrible and needs to be the same as the in game video settings. Also there should be more resolution settings (such as 1360x768 for me).

(If there are other things I feel need to be here I'll edit it in.)"
12330,there is no fullscreen!!!
12331,it says error but if i get to play it i think it will be good.
12332,you play as the good guys vs zombies
12333,dont bother playing with windows
12334,"I haven't even played for 30 minutes and i still know its too good to be true. It's like a gift from to the people who don't have counter strike go. Its sooooo fun and with now both zombie and team modes so you won't be bored. Definetly worth checking out, might not be a huge graphic showdown compared to csgo but it serves its place as a good counter strike game :)"
12335,"Jesus. Fucking. Christ. This game.... Can not be put into words. It`s probably the worst game i`ve ever played in my history of PC gaming. This p2w Company comes along with a absolutely TERRIBLY coded and designed game, Slaps Counter Strike brandings on in, and somehow got onto Steam. About 95% of Greenlight games are better then this by far. 

I first entered the game. Already could tell some Korean/Japanese company designed it from the poor translation and Chinglish. ""Out of ammo. Get ammo from base"" ""Reward daily. Come soon!"" The main menu is a disgrace, looks bad and horribly optimized.

You dont even want to know the rest. Guns, Characters, the fucking map for fucks sakes looks like a class of 7th graders got ahold of Unity and made this shit during lunch. 


Rating: -69420/10. Think the game was better while it was downloading."
12336,"It is very much like any paid version, i love it and hope you will!"
12337,this fucking sucks
12338,holy fcuk this game is so good
12339,"it is bad zombies have 2 much health and it is nothing like counter stirke
"
12340,"Another crappy rehash of 1.6 zombies where zombies have a ridiculously high hp and they have to infect all the regular players. Been there done that. Old CS 1.6 graphics and maps nothing really updated or new. Same game on every map 1 player boosts everyone onto a ledge zombies cant reach and the survivors just hold down the left mouse button spraying till the zombie dies and respawns to do the same thing. No new content to explore horrible graphics and such a huge file for such a garbage game

0/10 this game fails on a whole new epically higher level i cant believe someone wasted their time to ""program"" this when they could have just did the same thing on CS:S which has better graphics"
12341,with a laptop or unpowerful computer this game is very slow and untrustworthey
12342,Eventhough this is not the best game of zombies. It earns respect because we can now play the old counter strike for free. I would like to thank Nexon for bringing this game back and the zombies feture is not that bad istead is fun. This whole game is fun because its coounter strike. COME ON PEOPLE IS COUNTER STRIKE.

12344,"Okay, now everyone says it's uninstallation simulator and everything, and in regard to the zombies, I agree. But, you get to play CS 1.6 for ABSOLUTELY FREE. Recently, I haven't had enough money to buy CS:GO, even though I want it. This game is a good introduction and I think it is pretty fun. 2/5 But free Counter Strike."
12345,I like soccer...
12346,"Yes, it is horrible, but for myself its a tollerable horrible. It has the graffics of 1.6 totally but the gameplay isn't too bad. The crafting system is really creative in the way that the more you play the more weapons you get. I like it personally but everyone else i know dislikes it"
12347,"Not sure what to say about this addition.  I found it very difficult to get into a game.  Connection always lost no matter what time I tried getting in.  Game play was not the same as CSGO.  Graphics were also not as sharp, crisp.  I would not recommend this game."
12348,"If you still have CS: 1.6 on your Steam Account, just go on to a Zombieserver and some of them did a better job than an accepted modification, wow."
12349,Nexon truly knows how to ruin a game.
12350,"If your going to make a mod from a game thats about 15 years old, don't make it suck balls."
12351,"Annoying voice overs ""WE HAVE BEEN ENSLAVED BY THE ZOMBIES"" ""THE ZOMBIES WILL RETURN"" over and over and over and over, same repetitive gameplay shit, pay to win, barely CS at all. It's way too....Adulterated to be considered a Counter Strike game. 
I felt dirty playing this game, and I still feel dirty now that I uninstalled it."
12352,Just play CounterStrike:Source ZMod... way better than this...
12353,Good game
12354,"Zombies. Regular mode. Customized loadouts. Level up. Free to play. It's not the same as the Counter-Strike we all know, but it's a unique game in itself. Play it, get into it and you'll see how it can be fun in it's own right as it's own game."
12355,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
12356,This game is such crap that I thought of the holocaust to make myself feel better.
12357,quite possibly the biggest pile of crap ive played in a long time
12358,pretty decent when i was a kid and played ROBLOX there was a game on there exactly like this brought back some memories 7.5/10
12359,Werry fun. With much action.
12360,This sucks balls.........
12361,"22.12.2014.
After my first review and a few months of silence, I gave this game another shot. The game got improoved, but it's still not enough good from my opinion...I mean it could be much better than this. BUT it seems groving, it's better and better every day. Hope they'll do their best and make a superb game for all of us. This time I recommend it! Why? Because it seems much better then a few months back when I tried it out for the first time!

Well, I thought it'll be more ""CS-ish""... Gameplay and interface is like Crossfire's. Bots are stupid, low-skilled players. I can't tell anything good about this game. This is no longer Counter-Strike. :( Try it out if you want, but be prepared to see something non-cs-ish. Hope they will do something with this game and make it better..."
12362,This game can run on any computer old or new its fun to play and addictive.
12363,"Its an alright game, nothing special but i'd recommend it to anyone wanting to have a bit of fun."
12364,Imagine if Counter-Strike and Left 4 Dead had a baby... a Deformed baby.... well then you're at the right place.
12365,THIS is the best avp game and i can say it beats alien isolation but mostly beats alien colonial marines...(to be ones anny game beats aliens colonial marines )but anyway i recomand this game i just enden the predator campaign on hard dif and its awsome sadly it its just to shortt on campaign im gonna look for mods of more sp missions but anyway if u love avp series then u need to have this!
12366,"worst pile of crap ever, don t install this bullshit!"
12367,horrible game
12368,One of the most shittiest games I played hands down
12369,"It's basically CS Online re-marketed to the Western audiences. If you've played it, gameplays remain the same except for some GUI tweaks and minor changes. 

Nexon constantly listens to players suggestions on the forums which helps them to improve the game over time.

And remember to disable any unnecessary programs before running CSN:Z; you don't want HShield come biting you in the bum."
12370,"i played for three seconds and then got shot in the head by a scar-h apparently
10/10"
12371,First attempt at playing lasted 16 minutes. It took me about 10 minutes to download. WORTH???
12372,"The epitome of all idiot simulators.

How to play:

If you install, you have completed the idiot simulator

I r8 n b8 8/8"
12373,prolly the gayest excuse for a fps game im ever experienced... not even 5 min of gameplay and i was uninstalling
12374,noot noot noot
12375,Worst CS game ever. The fact that there is lag and that you have every gun unlocked is ridiculously not amusing. The points are used to buy special power ups but no new guns. Waste of time.
12376,"This is my first review, so be gentle.

no"
12377,Counter Strike 1.6 + Zombies + Some New Weapon + New skins maybe
12378,"I'm pretty tired of everyones negative view about Counter-Strike: Nexon Zombies, dont think you should think it is bad just because of their reviews,(dont think its any good too with good reviews! lol) honestly all i see with peoples reviews is: Bad, pay4gunz, nexon, bad graphics, CS 1.6. First of it, it is not bad, i happen to own CS 1.6 (i dont have CS: CZ) but i hear that this game is running off of Condition zero which is honestly not that different from CS 1.6, there are plenty of servers available as well as plenty of people, though you might run into different language servers here and there.

its not as bad as people say it is, please at least give it a try, its not like it stays on your computer forever, we are human > Trial and error."
12379,w0w~
12380,"Counter Strike 1.6 with a pay-to-win model.
This trash doesn't even deserve a full review.
Even if you can look past that, there are LOADS of issues. You are better off buying 1.6 or GO than this greedy company's ""adaptation"" of what Counter Strike is. It's literally 1.6 but you have to buy and rent guns. (TO HAVE THEM AVAILIABLE IN-GAME)
Also most people who say that they like this game are 7-15 years old. Believe me, I asked.

1/5  
1 point for cool maps."
12381,"Not sure why some people give this game a bit of hate.  Honestly, I think this game is another fantastic addition to the franchise.  The multiplayer modes and maps take us all the way back to CS 1.6, the good ole days!! But the most remarkable part of this game is easily the zombies!  In this game, they take an old idea (zombies) and add so many new modes and ways to play that it becomes utterly addicting.  There are a few bugs out there, but this game isn't pay to win at all, and the gameplay is not only classic, but fantastic!  With some patching and more work, I would go as far to say this would be the Free to Play Game of the Year.  97/100"
12382,"No, just no."
12383,PIECE OF CRAP REALLY? A SOCCER GAMEMODE THIS IS TERRIBLE all people play is teamdeathmatches and soccer gamemodes its hard to join zombies
12384,Fast and Very Fun to play with friends
12385,"This game is just wow. I mean, I have Counter Strike portable for my Kindle Fire, but this is to good! I recomend this to all the people who love First person, MMO, and who just love counter strike!"
12386,Its ok. But i dont know how play zombies mode.
12387,It is pretty much just a glorified verson of zombie ecscape. Sorry guys but i didnt liek it.
12388,"This game is so unbalanced and broken, no point to playing it at all"
12389,"this is just bad. From a big franchise such as Counter Strike i expect more, granted it is free and if i payed for this i would have been hacked. If this game was from a brand new programmer like in high school i would be impressed but this puts to shame the counter strike name and i am a big advocate of cs go 
"
12390,"Why the hell aren't you people playing this? It's basically Counter-Strike 1.7 with better gamemodes and MORE GUNS AFTER ALMOST 15 YEARS

WHO CARES IF THE MENU IS SHIT"
12391,"Counter strike with zombies, great for CS 1.6  fans"
12392,420/10 would never play again... bye
12393,th1s game lacks sw3g. 2/10
12394,the maps suck. the game play sucks. this game sucks.
12395,"CSN:Z, I dub thee the new ""Connection terminated simulator of 2014.""
With all the constant matenience that only allows you to get about 2/3 games in a night, the game is quite stupid.
The zombies mode gameplay is fun though..So. My vote for it is a yes/no, or about a 6/10. 
Gameplay is still fun either way."
12396,awesome
12397,Couldnt join any games...
12398,just buy cs 1.6 and play on the modded servers.
12399,"This game sucks so hard it will suck a golf ball through a garden water hose.
The Zombies are so badly animated, that you are laughing from the first second on.
I have plaed the game 5 Minutes long and now it will be uninstalled.
If you are looking for a decent zombie-shooter with nice coop buy killing floor in a sale on steam.
Nexon Zombies isnt worth the price even though its ""free""
(Free only if u dont buy weapons --- lol)"
12400,Welcome to CS 1.6
12401,"Good for a laugh. Not something I'd use micro payments on though.

Probably chuck it on once in a while.

I'll give it a 7/10. Improvement needed."
12402,"10/10 i was a zombie and i punched a kid and he screamed FUCK, next thing i heared was his parents yelling at him for swearing."
12403,DO NOT GET IT IT MESSES UP LEFT 4 DEAD 2 AND GMOD WITH THAT MOVING MOUSE THING THAT TURNS SLOWLY AND ITS BUGGY LIMITED WEAPON GRAPHICS ARE TERRIBLE COULD OF MAKE IT GO GRAPHICS -10000000000000000/10 WOULD NEVER PLAY AGAIN.
12404,"This is similar to many in-game-transaction (free) game we used to have back in the days. Which is why I say when you play this game, ignore everything BUT the open lobby of games to play.

This game is an artwork; it contains the mechanic and the dynamic of the original CS we all are used to and loved. The swarming of the zombies are a piece of work as well as your teammates who decides ""everyman for himself"" and get the entire team zombified are real jerks to work with. However, try playing this with friends or people with mics. The experience increases tenfold as you scream, laugh, and sacrafice yourself in vain for the greater good of buying your fellow humans a couple of seconds before hunting the same teammates down again.

Oh, did I mention that despite many of the in-game-transaction, the game is balanced? The -in-game purchases unlocks a couple of guns unavailable to us but everything in its arsenal are more than enough to satisfy an avrg gamer.

Happy Shootings everyone!

TL:dr - don't bother with the user-interface of this game. Just go into a game mode and play. It's the CS you know and love. Start eating your friends."
12405,"Standing from 1 - 10, i'd give it a square root(-1) because the fun in this is imaginary.   It's just people camping next to where everyone spawns and the zombies are invinsible in the zombie escape."
12406,GG D:
12407,"For a new player, this game felt like a waste of my precious time

I'll have that 2GB back thankyou"
12408,"Didn't really care for it. Zombies are incredibly powerful and the guns are pretty much useless. Plus it glitches a bit and the graphics could be a bit better. Play Global Offensive, not this."
12409,Rubbish
12410,"I've had more fun watching paint dry...

12411,One of the best games I ever played 10/10 though the graphics and textures are basic there is barely any lag for me though  so I dont mind it.
12412,Play this almost every day now. I suggest to everyone.
12413,"This is a game that I play because I like it, and it is free."
12414,Norm Game )
12415,"In a nutshell this just feels like a quite poorly fan made counter stike mod, it's about 10 years late, and poorly made. The menus are buggy and often difficult to navigate. Many players cannot play in the resolution we would like to, myself included.

I installed the game thinking I would get a great nostalgic gaming experience, instead it was just a waste of time. Honestly I cannot see why anyone would prefer this over the myriad of other free fps games out there.

I don't normally take the time to write reviews, but this game is so terrible it warrants it. I've been playing CS in its various forms from back around Christmas 1999, and that's why I felt the need to leave this negative review. This is the worst version of counter stike I have tried. In 14+ years I've had plenty of time to play some very bad mods too."
12416,Its bull**** you need buy every gun its not worth Fya
12417,Nope
12418,THE ACHIEVEMENTS DOESNT UNLOCK!!!1
12419,No.
12420,I liked this game
12421,"Despite what most people say, this is actually a pretty fun game to play :) It is slightly glitchy in terms of movement, but i can play on servers perfectly fine, I'd reccommend this to anyone who wants to play a free action zombie FPS with CS weapons or who just wants to play an intense and fun zombie shoot-em-up with some friends

I give it 7/10
The Devs just need to fix the glitchiness"
12422,"In one minute you shoot zombies like hell, then in a blink of an eye you are a zombie, chasing CT-s.
Love it. Highly recommended."
12423,"Well, it's definitely fun game, but honestly it's just cs 1.6 with zombies :D"

12426,"Imagine what COD would be on the PlayStation 1 with microtransactions and zombies and you get Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies. Bad move Valve, bad move."
12427,"An odd, obtuse and buggy game made with original Half-Life engine. Looks bad, plays bad, is thoroughly unenjoyable. Free, but with micro-transactions. Clicking on options can get you stuck.

Avoid."
12428,"OK first off, this is and always will be one of my favorite games of all time. Im talking about CS 1.6... But besides that, This game is actually very fun


Your able to get premium weopons without paying for them, so long as you just play

The only thing that they have to buy currently are players and weopon crafting stuff, witch isnt needed. KEEP IT THIS WAY

Counter strike is one of my favorite games of all time. I play it alot

Hackers havnt been a problem yet


Its made by nexon, so sooner or later there will most likely be NX shoved down the throat of this game. Leaving nothing behind but people who pay to win. Witch isnt reccomended, you guys there at nexon have enough money to fully fund the cure for cancer 5 times over. So dont F that part up

```````````````````
Bad stuff

Made by Nexon

The recoil in this game... NEEDS ALOT of work. When im aiming down the sights with my revolver with my scope, and the dots right on the guy, and i still see the bullet wiz to the right or left or any direction and hit the wall behind him. I Freak out. Because I was aiming at him. Not moving. Crouched. Still missed, and it still happens here and there. I feel like the recoil in this game has specific percentages on how much your moving, if your crouched, and the crosshair does NOTHING to impact how and where you shoot. So fix it, seriously.

Family is a cool and new thing thats in this game. Its like a clan, only CS own little way of saying what it is. Manage it and send out notifications EXC. Join other familys, have storages that people can access....... The one thing that NEEDS to be set differently is the time on where you can join one family. What i mean by this is that when your in a family, you leave for some reason or another, and you wanna join another family. You HAVE to WAIT 2 weeks untill you can join another family. My friend was in a family before just to see how it is and all that, then he left and I invited him to my own that I made myself. He couldnt join and we were both pissed the fuck off, it doesnt tell you that you have to wait. It lets you go and makes you regret the decision. Fix that Please

The maps are cool, some are really small but hey, whatever ya know.

Game types are different from what ive seen in alot of games ~
Beast- Fight at a church and kill other people. Theyl drop these stones that anyone can grab, get three of them and turn into this big beast they call the yeti. Multiple people can use it at once and itl become a one big beast fight in the middle of the map to see who the fastest clicker is. Its decent

TDM/Original/Bot TDM/ Arms race / DM

 Basic gamemodes that most FPS shooters have, same concept, different game, different guns, different maps.

Other gamemodes that are ok

Scenerios

` Basicly just one building, or area, where you the player choose your weopons and and fight big waves of bosses, and bots of couse. Each with there own set of health, weakpoints , weopons and killing styles. There are currently only 2 scenerios, Zombie and Human.

Weopons

` Theres quite a few for a just launched game. So Clap clap on that. Recoil needs help.

Melee

` Its decent, make sure to aim the crosshair right at the guy your trying to wrek. Otherwise youl miss and get humililiated.

Disc space isnt that much, maybe 3 GB, Good for a remake of a game


One other thing. Theres thing called Zombie Shelter.... WTF were you thinking when you made that gametype. Theres no tut, i had no idea what i was doing. Money making is shit, and when people leave on like round 5, and your all by yourself you might as well just quit. Cause when u die you lose everything, including money you took 5 hours to get. So when you see a match with that. Keep scrolling.

Theres Plenty more, but its 2 in the morning and i have school at 8 #Sophomore 

EDIT_-_-_-_

Ok, so newest update came out. Cool.
Nothing i noticed really. Maybe connection stuff? They say trading cards are in, when i dont see any in my invetory!

Recoil is better though. Thank you on that one.

One other thing. I was playing in a match, and when all the terrorists were dead on DE_Dust2 the game wouldnt end. So we all ran around and attempted suicide many times,

Crafting needs updating. Ive been getting so many fails its not even funny. I bought a Weopon enhancment kit, and seriously 3-10 of them failed. WASTE of points, I get that it fails sometimes. But not 7 out of 10 times. So poo on that till it gets updated"
12429,Wasting my time

12431,"this game wow, its like playing the very first counter strike, but with the lag  of cod black ops"
12432,This game is pretty damn fun. Lots of weapons to unlock and tons of gamemodes to play.
12433,BARRIERS. BARRIERS ARE EVERYWHERE.
12434,Terrible.
12435,Aweful. Just Aweful. I thought it was going to be fun and it isn't. Don't bother with it.
12436,I would say this game is fun with all the ways you can play with friends and others to cooperate in missions. Even though the graphics are nice and the gaming system is not that good i wouldn't care as this game has potential. I express that it is a game worth playing in my opinion even if its not good. My friends even like it aswell at times whenever we want to play something together. Playing a game is fun as long as it has a way for us to make it fun for all of us gamers today.
12437,Its great! if you cant load this game it means your computer is bad -_-
12438,"The cow goes ""moo""
The duck goes ""quack""
The chicken goes ""cluck""
And the dog goes ""o my ghad""

Edit: I had to change my review cause when i decided to play this game recently I discovered the game stole my DLCs i bought (and by extension my money) without any form of compensation. I beg you to please not support the developers by playing this game

P.S. they even removed the DLCs from the store page"
12439,Too many server problems. Too many bugs and crashes
12440,Ridiculous
12441,"Just not free... no if, no buts only sucks. Horrible"
12442,Came back to this game and not much has changed. Noticed that the entire store is a scam like c'mon 5 dollars to reset stats like wtf?
12443,"I CANT EVEN FUCKING GET IN THE GAME!!!!! WHEN I TRY TO GET ON IT, IT SAYS ""THIS GAME REQUIRES STEAM"". I HAVE TRID FOR 5 HOURS ALREADY DAMMIT. FUCK YOU NEXON!!!!"
12444,FUK DIS
12445,Counter-Strike w/ Nexon swag it fun try it 7/10
12446,bad
12447,it's decent.
12448,"Honestly? I found it unintuitive and boring. If nothing else, it certainly LOOKS like Counter-Strike..."
12449,"If you like holding down M1, this is the game for you."
12450,"Fun games! The maps are low res so even my sh*t PC can handle it and I enjoy the classic and the new modes added! The only problem I have encountered is IMMENSE stuttering when playing some of the zombie modes. Otherwise, it is an excellent game and I highly recomend it. ^_^"
12451,it sucks and dont even think abou getting it  :(
12452,Best game ever. I rate is 12/10 dolphins
12453,"like the game
"
12454,"THIS GAME RUNS SMOOTHLY!
My expectations for this game were fairly low as soon as I opened it up. This is due to the fact that the menu window does not fit onto the screen and has no full screen option. This makes it hard to navigate and craft weapons. This however wont be a problem for those of you with the almost tv size monitors. However if you can get over the navigation issues with the menu this game is actually really good. All the features work, the gameplay is smooth and never crashed once. I think that with some bug fixing for the menu, this game has more than a chance of being an extremely popular game! 
8/10"
12455,people on this game are the biggest pieces of shit i have ever seen
12456,"they took a beautiful classic fps,and turned it into a cool zombie game"
12457,finallly downloaded.....yet when i click on it it doesn't do anything. not ONE THING shows up yet my steam says im playing it. but nothing happens
12458,"This game is awesome. For those not wanting to/can't buy CS:GO or CS:S, this is the next best thing."
12459,game is good if you want an experience of counter strike w/o pirating lol
12460,Faith in humanity lost.
12461,I was trying to find a game that was ppl vs zombies but couldnt find any. all the games that i joined were just pvp. no zombies. maybe i wasn't looking hard enough but i was a little disappointed.
12462,utter shit. better playing cs source.
12463,"Counter-Strike Nexon - stop.

Nexon."
12464,"Very bad game, made on Old CS Engine, really shouldn't been released like this."
12465,"This game is very good. if you like zombie fps then this is the game for you! The only bad part is that i cant log on to play because it always kicks me out saying ""connection to the server has been lost"", but i think they are making a patch for it. But anyway, i do love this game and i do reccomend it. Keep up the good work Nexon!!! :)"
12466,wont eve fuking start load of shit
12467,"It's got an nice desktop icon but unplayable becuase of the Hack Shield issues

-10/10"
12468,"Alright. Im going to explain why u should [u]ignore all of the negative reviews[/u]. This game rocks. The zombie game modes peopel are complaining about suck. I agree. But the real fun is the PvP gamemodes. With the TDM, DM, and original counter strike bomb planting, this game is a blast of nostalgia. Imagine CS:GO with old graphics. And ITS FREE. I would pay for this game, but they give it out! I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes fps or anyone in general."
12469,"i love This game no lag :D
"
12470,"I couldn't even play this due to ""server errors""...don't waste your time."
12471,"Good ShIt

Best Soocer game ever

Mario Kart FPS

10/10"
12472,It's pretty fun although it lags sometimes (that might be me though). Also the servers can go down for maintaince (<- I h8 speeling). Overall its a very good game; and its FREE :D. One more thing to add is that it is zombies and regular cs 1.6
12473,"Not bad +700 hours lol
3 years Later
Still cool game but boi its pay to win if you don't pay you will get rekt"
12474,"Zombies eat more bullets than in the Division and the walls are most likely made of the money Nexon is trying to make with this game.

12475,"I dont know what is wrong with this game but it cant even render game to my screen correctly.... When ever i launch the game, main menu is out of the screen, but it gets worse. When i go in a server, my game screen only shows 1/4 of the actual game. Basically game cannot render picture to my screen as whole. It just shows a piece of it."
12476,the gameplay is alright if a little outdated but can provide a few hours of diverting fun. the main problems with this game are the old fashioned menu system and the recurring technical issues when trying to connect to the servers.
12477,WOW :D
12478,"Controls aren't smooth, maps are WAY too small (to the point where your team is bunched together), and it has no clear UI. I will consider downloading again if it gets better controls, a new UI, and bigger maps."
12479,"i played this game back in 1999-2002
was a part of amxmodx and wrote turkish danish languages for that mod a breakout mod from original amxmod djeyl OLO team, was running 4 servers at that time 3*32player and 1*16player funmod 1.3WONid (black deagle anyone) :D before it went 1.5 then eventually 1.6Steamid where steam took over or was launched

this is the first time i tried CS since that time if you are into it its fine but i need to add
that absolutely nothing other then eye candy and maybe server optimization has changed
the game look exactly the same from maps down to animations i couldnt bare play such an oldie
when thinking of games such as BF, ARMA and CoD is out hell even that A.V.A alliance of valiant arms? free to play
is far better today it was good for its time but need a serious revamp into the future."
12480,I tried it thinking Counter Strikers were just being overly critical like always. Nope. This game is terrible. Surprised Valve allowed this to happen.

12482,This is the worst cs edition lol VALVE
12483,"Counter Strike is one of my favorite series of games, but then I found this. The graphics are from one of their first games, which is sad. The voice acting is horrible, and the purchasing of weapons is extremely glitched. A good idea for a game, but please fix this before I enter a good review."
12484,I can not put my name in the game
12485,CAN YOU REPAIR THIS GAME !!!! OMG I CANT GO TO SERVERS EVROPA 3 -.-
12486,"This Game is pretty fun, the zombie mode is kind of buggy, but still a load of fun :D"
12487,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
12488,Why did valve allow this game to bare the counter strike name? This game is terrible.
12489,"Why does this game exist? Why can't you just go play Zombie Mod on CS:S, way funner then this."
12490,"my server is constantly terminated.

BEST EA SERVER SIMULATOR 2014!!!"
12491,looks pretty good
12492,"half the time i cant play this game since the servers are down WTF
"
12493,The game i wanted 10 years ago
12494,"1. Good game and who doesnt have cs 1.6 this is great for thoose type of ppl.
2. I like it because u can craft weapons get some upgrades and make ranks.
3. Why this game doesnt support higger resolution then 1024x768 px.
4. Where are trading cards ?
"
12495,"What can I say about this game...bugged, bugged and bugged. When i could finally play for 10 attempts to load, I had got crashed. Everything is like in normal CS, but it's more bugged. I like Counter Strike series, but this is the worst game about CS.

!!! I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME !!!"
12496,0/10 cant connect to servers! worst game ever cant even play it! DONT INSTALL!
12497,Very fun to play
12498,p2w garbage
12499,Hello.My friends and i fond too many bugs on the game 1:I sarted the game and always i look this message:Error or launch the game again can fix it pls?We had this bug.
12500,"It's not as bad as people say it is. I played quite a bit of Source and GO, and didn't really play the CS 1.6 or CZ so this was a new experience for me. 

The zombie mode is pretty legit since you can craft everything. The regular arcadish game style was something new and I feel that the microtransactions wouldn't make that big of a difference if you were simply good at shooters. There are quite a bit of game modes that me and my friends spent lots of time on.

The biggest things for me are the connection problems when you are trying to login (which are apparently being fixed) or the sound sfx/music that blares everytime you start the game because it doesn't save those settings apparently.

I'd definitely recommend at least taking a shot at this game once before all these negative reviews get to you."
12501,really fun but there are connection errors VERY often...
12502,"video graphics are not good, the rest is ok"
12503,Good but resolve the  connection problem!
12504,"I hate everything about this game ACCEPT for Original. 
1. They should of fixed their shitty connection error BEFORE the game came out.
2. Menus Suck Dick
3. All the Zombie modes suck

4. I love original, Its comp 1.6 with a twist

That is why im recommending this shitty game is only to the people who like comp CS, other than that, dont bother.
"
12505,"Its a good game it just wont let me start
it just says server connection terminated 
but other then that its great"
12506,Great fun free game. Wish the servers worked better tho
12507,"the game does not work
"
12508,*Servers terminated*
12509,dont work ! fckg game ..
12510,"This game is the classic CS with some adds form Global Offensive and all the mods that we lovesd on the classic:Footbal,Zombie,Shelter,etc where u can paly even the classic cs with freinds.
Pro:-many cool guns, knifes, pistols
       -no need to host the server in your pc
       -many mods
       -with lvl up sitem and craft
       -popular(you can find a server of your on like very fast)
       -is fun to play with the friends
       -no hacks(until now)
Cons:-the zombies are to OP in some maps/mods
         -you can find a bunch of noobs at all mods
         -sometimes crashes and lag can make you very angry\
         -not to many maps :(

12511,Fire in the hole! Go go go!
12512,"game cannot load much and terminates servers every time u try to play and has no servers up
"
12513,update the game and do a shop sistem like in cs:go that will be very nice to sell the crafted items
12514,"If you don't like this game just Go and play Mario or something . It's cool Crafting and things Counter-strike Combined with
Tf2 Or other Games"
12515,"YES YES YES!

12516,cant even play it

12518,"Another free to play game has launched, and this one seems to be a mess. Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is a take on the classic Counter-Strike game, adding zombies to the mix across 50 maps of play and dozens of modes. Unfortunately my first impressions with the game were poor - a confusing interface, an engine based on Half-Life 1, and poor performance all yielded a sub par result in game play.

For the most part the game seems to feature a variety of competitive mode of play where the traditional teams of Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists face off, but must also face the zombie threat as second thread. While the game has added new weapons and characters, including female characters to play as, it still contains a lot of the classic look and feel with maps such as de_dust and de_metro present. 
In terms of co-op, it appears there are two modes that support true co-op play. One is called ""Human Scenario"" where you face off against an ""army of computer controlled opponents."" I played a few minutes of it and basically shot at drones barely making a dent in the boss's health with 6 other people. The other mode is called Zombie Shelter, which appears to have some sort of strategy elements too it, but also an optional PvP element. Players must secure a shelter and then repel waves of zombies."
12519,i dont put it opent :(
12520,"I wrote a huge positive review for this game, but then i figured i would go ahead and play it some more before submitting. Well that was 3 hours ago and ive yet to get it to connect to any server and crash crash.

I will write that positive review someday when they fix there shit and make it stable which im sure they will eventually get around to when it starts affecting there bottom line. 

I still think its awesome for a Free2play game never thought id see cs 1.6 getting dished out for free. That is pretty cool and  besides the crashes and server problems there really isnt much to bitch about. Sure there trying to get people to spend money but thats part of the business model and is expected. Ive seen games that were way worse with f2p model.

MY major point is you can play all the classic cs maps with classic cs weapons and enjoy the old school cs goodness.
And that is not a thing to bitch about. And as a added bonus they added some mehhh zombie game mode that is more fun then solitaire or minesweeper that dont cost squat.

Meanwhile ill be playing warframe waiting for them to fix there server problems."
12521,"Not to bad takes a while to get into the game, pretty fun though, and its free so why not"
12522,"BAD . I just can't play it . It crashes and it says that I need to restart it . After restart , nothing changes ."
12523,"its pretty good game for freetoplay but i dont like that how the game try to sell you all the shit like some weapons...
goldsource games are allways good and they have a goodfeel when ingame.
zombies are very good detailed and stuff.

I recommend this game to anyone who plays zombie games and likes hl1 engine :)
7/10 game."
12524,"11/10 couldn't connect to the host, host being myself"
12525,"How this game was made
1.They took cs 1.6
2.They added zombies in it
3.Added some more shit in it
Done 
Could of atleast tried

UPDATE: It's still shit"
12526,"I'm not sure which I preferred - this, or having piles..."
12527,"i cant play becase the windows is really small and i cant click on anything, please hellp :<<<<<<<<<<<<<<"
12528,"Nice one - OK anyone from old school CS there is quite a lot in here - a couple of mods puts together, and the CS:CZ engine ( from what I can see so far ) if you only ever played CS:Source or CS:GO it may seem a bit retro but whoever put this together it was an act of love of the game. Really good fun - glad to see the all the old game types too. Don't discount it and it reminds me of when CS was fun - good effort guys"
12529,"1/10 BRAINS! AWFUL COMBAT, AND SHIT GAMPLAY!"
12530,its ok just the servers need t obe patched other wise good
12531,It's like Nexon and Couter Strike had a very ugly and laggy child. Bad move on teaming up with Nexon...
12532,good game but it is too laggy for me to do anything
12533,"so bad, this is 2014 what the hell is with the graphis and pop in.
glad it was free.... uninstal 
"
12534,This shit will give you ebola or aids dont even fucking bother downloading it. (its made by chinks so the are communstis and will hack ur computer from december)
12535,"This is the worst game i've ever played. It looks like shit, and the game just doesn't even work very well."
12536,is good with need gun and charaters
12537,"Like a 1.6 , cs:go , source :)"
12538,used to be good now nothing but wind now.
12539,It doesnt load propperly and most doesnt let me play the game so why should i waste space on a game that doesnt let me play
12540,Plz take this garbage off Steam.
12541,Its really fun. Add zombies to the game also gives the original CS in there
12542,"I am actually a huge fun of the Games Original Mode, where you play the usual defuse or hostage Game. 

Man if you want to enjoy some oldschool pub cs in cz or 1.6 style, just download the shit, its FREE :)"
12543,"Idk if I'm the only one with this problem.
I downloaded the game and managed to play Shelter and other matches just fine. Go home and decide to play again and now its been 4x in a row that I log on and this game makes my entire computer freeze. Wtf"
12544,Servers On Maintence
12545,"Totally not recommend it.

It may seem awesome because it looks like 1.6 (and I thought it was an awesome game cuz I miss playing 1.6) but this game actually suckz; and that's without taking into account the fact that is pay2win"
12546,I am addicted ! lol!
12547,sucks
12548,":)
"
12549,i like zombie shelter
12550,"This game is counter-strike online 1 / counter-strike Nexon: Zombies

If you where expecting counter-strike online 2 your mistaken. That will be on the source engine and is currently in open beta in only korea right now. If you want you can try and pirate it but I don't think it will help. I wouldn't try it but you can.

Plus this game is on the 1.6 counter strike engine I was kinda sad at first cause i was expecting the 2nd one. But who cares it was still released and you can play  your counter-strike mods that you liked then and play them now."
12551,Counter strike and nexon are my two favorite things in gaming plus nexon remade counter strike 1.6 into zombies
12552,"it's pretty good and really fun, Nexon, just please fix ur probs on ur games asap/faster"
12553,"Horribly disapointed.... i am a huge CS fan, i love COD zombies and L4D, but this game is a joke..."
12554,OMG GET RKT SICK GAME!
12555,sucked.....
12556,"much fun
"
12557,I personally like this game
12558,dont listen to the other faggots its 13/10
12559,"This game has potential, yes the graphics are dated but the gameplay is  really good, if you used to play cs 1.6 then you will feel right at home, but the problem is the bugs, and the errors. I have been gaming for a long time now and this game by far beats any game , (including alpha's, closed betas, and open betas) in bugs than any other game i have ever played. Its hiliarious that unturned has better coding and it came from a teenager still in high school. Before you release your game to the public make sure the servers work right. I either get connection losses, or crashs, or cant connect to host, plus a few more. Please fix this, this is a really good game, just covered in poorly designed coding."
12560,"You can't even play this game at 1080p, it just shows half of the screen.,.."
12561,not bad
12562,"What a fuckin joke.

Get 1.6 instead."
12563,"Well it's official, I have quite a game only 10 mins after starting it for the first time. It is a very confusing game because it is marketed as a version of Counter-Strike with Zombies, but acts more like a free to play shooter that happens to have similar textures that look worse than Counter-Strike: Source. Not only are the textures terrible, but it is not possible to run the game at any form of high resolution. I run all my games at 1600:900 which is absent from this game all together. Now for the gameplay, it is just flat out terrible. There are two types of games in this game all about micro-transactions, which are sort of traditional Counter-Strike PvP and some terrible version of infection game types. The normal Counter-Strike PvP feels terrible and is a poorly made PvP game type. It is just traditional deathmatch with very simple spawn points with conflict only being in the middle of a very boring designed map. Then the zombies PvP is the same thing as the traditional PvP, just with one team being zombies. It is exactly like any custom server you can play on with the traditional Counter-Strike: Source, and looks worse. The game is heavily based on it's micro-transactions, making it so guns are just ""trials"" that you have for like 1 to 3 days. This game is very poorly made and I do not plan to play again any time in the future."
12564,"its a good game.I like it beacuse its free and i personally (exuse my spelling if its wrong) enjoy it. I play zombie escape and zombie senario primarly. and lastly I'd like to point out the negative reviews littered every where are made by people who didnt even play longer than a f*ckin hour.seriously? I saw one with 0.1 hours on record... in other words 6 MINUTES!!? and my computer is horrible, I cant even play minecraft with all the video setting i lowered cuz it lags like if im In 1000 tabs on internet explorer. and this one runs perfectly. the only time it lags is when there are a lot of zombie in front of me and i still know whats going on. and i never even got one server termination. I dont even know what that is. Is it like host migration on cod? i dont know the only thing that i dont like is the crafting with a blueprint and durable.it fails...a lot and then it tells me to use grade a or s blueprints because they fail less even though thats what I've been using. mabye that happens alot idk. Anyway, im getting off track. i like this game and play it a lot and trust me i have played more than half of the negative reviews, maybe more. I enjoy this game and its you choice to download it or not, it just pissed me off how people judge a game in 6 mins. and uninstall it. so who would you listen to more some dude who played for less than an hour or me who played for 6.9 hours. and i'm getting tired of typing cuz i want to play it now so expect that 6.9 to increase. bye."
12565,"This game is so bad.  This could possible be one of THE worst games I've ever played and I'm a HUGE Counter-Strike fan.
THOSE MOTHER FLIPPERS AT NEXON HAVE DESTROYED THE ORIGINAL CS AND JUST BOLTED ON A CONFUSING INTERFACE AND NUMEROUS GAME MODES THAT JUST DO NOT MAKE SENSE IN THE CS WORLD!!!"
12566,"It's free and that's all there really is to the good points of this game.
This is just a reiteration of a ripoff. The reiteration is that this game obviously uses the CS 1.6 engine. The ripoff is that everthing from the game modes, to the cheesy rewards, even to the main menu screen is all taken from another free to play game that came out much earlier called Cross Fire. If you have ever played Cross Fire which is hugely popular (I don't like that either), then you know what I am talking about.
I would not play anymore of this game but if you have kids and want to keep them cheaply entertained with the free games on Steam then let them have at it."
12567,Don't bother.
12568,Freaking Awesome!!!
12569,it was really plain and boring
12570,Pay 2 win garbage.
12571,"Not good game, it seems like a big ropoff of regular counter strike with even less features: paying for weapons, worse graphics, and no custom servers. This just might be worse than combat arms."
12572,"It's a fun game. If you don't like it, uninstall it. It's not like you spent money on it. I found myself playing this more than CS:GO at times. It's just stupid fun."
12573,the fact that this game is coming out late 2014 is a big fat joke
12574,not very good
12575,"It runs on most computers very well. It also is a very  easy game for most people, and it can not be hacked. You can play online multiplayer on a zombie map or a non zombie map, and on zombie maps you get to create your own class on your profile, and you get gifts for certain missions that you do."
12576,Uninstalling this game was a better experience than the actual game.
12577,Garbage. Absolute Garbage.
12578,"After several attempts to join the game without it kicking me off i finally get in and I'm met by four servers. Just four. I then see a huge amount of pop-ups and crap thrown at my face, likely to encourage micro-transactions. I then get into the game and have 2 minutes of the best time ever.

If you have friends and far too much time and patience on your hands, this game is worth an evenings entertainment."
12579,This Game is epic makes all other Zombie games look bad. I think anyone good at games would love this. ( Have to use mouse and keyboard)
12580,Realy good wainting for new updates
12581,"it wont let me launch the game
"
12582,"Decent game...
With friends...


But otherwise...
Its shit"
12583,"a bit boring
"
12584,"porque cuando abro el juego me sale que hay un fallo al inciar la conexion :c
"
12585,This game is not allowing me to connect. Support if you can see this please fix it.
12586,"Its a really fun game to me ,but im having a problem with it ,it keeps closing saying the game surver is terminated"
12587,"Whats worse than a game that you cant play?

.....oh wait, nothing.
Way to go Nexon, you done fucked up!"
12588,this game is amazing and i have played almost all the counter strikes and the fact they made a zombie mod of it is pretty good for people who likes zombies and counter strike
12589,"While this is no doubt a game inspired by Valve's 2000 classic Counter-Strike 1.6 (which was originally a game developed by Turtle Rock Studios), there are some major differences that separates it in terms of gameplay.  First off, it's obviously an MMORPG where you collect item drops and ultimately spend most of your time seeking them.  For this game obviously, you collect weapons and mid-game healing/respawn supplies, as well as items used to craft other weapons/supplies.  These new weapons can be upgraded to be more efficient while you are shooting down other players and NPCs where it could be very useful.  Oh and don't worry, the entire arsenal from the original game are included.  The game DOES offer a variety of gamemodes, from the popular zombie horror PvP to the endless zombie NPC waves.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed soon after it's public release on Steam.  The main menu was hard to navigate through because of the fact that the game starts up in a small window, which doesn't go into fullscreen until you start up a game.  Also, this menu is cluttered with buttons such as the special events going on, your character's inventory, the crafting menu, (etc.)  Some of the major problems that have come up since the release is the broken achievement system and the more recent connectivity issue where no one is able to play the game at all.

There are some minor issues in-game that I'd like to address if and when this game starts working again.  Until then, all I can say is that this game feels VERY incomplete, and that it was rushed before everything was fully tested.  I believe these major issues everyone is having may just be the result of it.  So, don't install this game if you appreciate being rewarded for you shooting skills rather than having to win by having the necessary items that you found by luck or by spending so much time grinding around for drops."
12590,"I don't even know where to start. This game does not deserve to be called ""Counter Strike"" , mainly because when you say Counter Strike , you think of Valve. And when you think of Valve , well , you think of perfection . I will write this review in the most honest way i can and you will see why Nexon is the worst game released this year.

[h1] The game [/h1]

The game is basically just CS 1.6 with its main focus being on Zombie Escape maps. There is nothing special about it , it's just the free version of the original Counter Strike that a poor person with a shitty PC would download. You start the game (after hundreds of tries and connection failures) and you just get confused : [b] TONS , and i mean TONS [/b] of menus and other things that don't do anything in particular. After about 20 seconds you get a pop-up message which tells you to choose a nickname . Unfortunately , even after you put your name and click OK , the message keeps appearing saying to put your name . 30 seconds later another pop-up message saying that the game lost connection will appear. You click OK and the game quits itself to the desktop.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

This piece of junk's gameplay is even worse than its menus. Apparently , the brilliant controls in CS 1.6 were ignored by the devs , so they created their own controls. You will find out that your character shoots with F , changes weapons with left click and many other settings that are not appropriate for a gamer. You will find it hard to move , aim ( sensitivity set to -1 ) , shoot , etc. 

[h1] The game's main focus [/h1]

As the title says , the game focuses on zombies . You have the same generic Zombie Escape modes that you see in EVERY SINGLE Counter Strike . The game also has classic modes , but the main color is gray combined with a dark blue , so you will not see anything , you will not know where to plant the bomb and so on . 
The Zombie Modes are in high number , but they are all the same . Either you're running from the zombies or confronting them face-to-face , you will feel the same . 

[h1] Weapons...? [/h1]

If you hate anime , like I do , you will realise that the weapons look too unrealistic , that they're not designed for humans . They are either too big , or they tend to occupy three quarters of your screen so you cannot see the zeds ( zombies ) coming from your right . The game also includes melee weapons , but again , they're too cyberpunk for my tastes. 

[h1] The maps [/h1]

There are so many shitty maps in this game that you'll start to cry. The game includes a few ugly-as-hell maps that have two main colors : red and black . Pixelated red and black
They are so bad , and you get stuck in so many corners that you will rage quit almost instantly.

[h1] The community [/h1]

The community is either formed of little 12 year olds that think this game is ""new"" and ""next-gen"" , or people like me , who are completely confused as to why would Valve add this to their free-to-play section

[h1] The final verdict [/h1]

Overall , this ""game"" is disgusting . Its gameplay , maps and community (half) are just an offense to Counter Strike . I added an extra point in my final score because i laughed so much with my friends at how bad this garbage is 


 [h1] 2/10 [/h1]
"
12591,awesome
12592,crap.
12593,"This game is sadly very disappointing I really tried to love this but I couldn't
-menus are hard to navigate
-lot's of connection errors (apparently being fixed)
-P2W bull**** (atleast from my understanding of things)
-in-game shop (that's a very bad sign especially in a game like C.S 1.6)
as I said it's disappointing I really wanted this to be good but I guess we can't have nice things for free.
"
12594,"when i join in CSN:Z: CAN' T CONNECT TO THE STEAM SERVER, LAUNCH THE GAME AGAIN...
Fck STEAM!!!!!!!!!!!"
12595,"Wow this game is amasing for low computers like mine,a bit laggy but awesome!Like its said for minecraft,Graphics dont matter gameplay does!
And guys its an old game dont be so judgy,its 1.6 just updated alot and im a fan of tat!"
12596,"Very great game to play with your friends and alone, lots of fun very easy to get stuff (like knives and weapons) not a PAY2WIN Game, really recommended!"
12597,ZOMBIE ESCAPE=LIFE
12598,"it was about time for someone make some modernity in this game,nice job"
12599,Its fun to play with friends
12600,!
12601,Another failed attempt to make profit from the remnants of Valve games by a no name trashy dev studio
12602,it crash becuase the server but the graphicks is like a old game but the gameplay is good
12603,current update doesnt work
12604,"I LOVE IT
"
12605,"Cant even play it,"
12606,Team Death-Match Vs AI is where I spend my time.
12607,This can be good if nexon would listen to the community it whould not haft to worry about getting money if the players enjoyed the game. And they really need to fix the hit boxes and the how far you get from the people.btw I am talking about the zombie mod
12608,"Can't even launch the god damn game, fuck this"
12609,Fck this game. Can't even start a match fcking Connection Terminated or something.
12610,"10/10 on the scale of crappy games this is on top ....You can clearly tell that nexon made this ""awesome"" title i've seen better mods with zombies on CS 1.6 made by amateurs. Good work nexon you never fail to disapoint when it comes to shovelware"
12611,Connection to the server has been terminated. Please launch the game again Simulator 2014
12612,"The negative reviews are true, couldn't even get into a server, within 20 seconds of launching the game, it crashes to desktop, and once where it actually held for 1 minute, I tried creating an ID and it didnt give a prompt of whether or not it was available. Not good at all."
12613,Best game EVER!!!!!!
12614,"""None of your friends have played this game recently. Tell them why they should.""

You shouldn't."
12615,i love it.
12616,Not good as classic counter-strike but its ok....
12617,Can't even say the gameplay sucks (and it does #p2w) because it won't let me play. 0/10 waste of disc space
12618,The only good cs game
12619,i never was into counter strike before but this has made me have a second thought
12620,"its a good game i wont lie
"
12621,"Zombie Shelter is the only thing worth playing, that is if you have someone to play it with you."
12622,fuck that shit
12623,Its just hard to like...
12624,can't play this game. Cant create nickname. I have create my nickname and click OK alot of times still not working >:-(
12625,Failed to initialize OpenGl. Please restart launcher. HELP
12626,The best zombie game i ever played!
12627,Screw this game!
12628,"Best game 10/10
would uninstall again"
12629,Connect to server has been terminated.. ??!
12630,Is Good Game And Very Nice I'dont kown why all player Wirte :Bad Game : Is good game
12631,"It is a really fun game indeed!
Alot of gamemodes to pick from!
Bugs make this game unplayable!
Launch the game to get a error requiring you to shut it down and restart, afterwards this appears again and again and again!
3 Hours wasted in trying to launch and it kept failing!
My friends have issues with gameplay and it lags too much for them!
I still adore this game but i can't even play it! UNPLAYABLE!!!"
12632,"Bad,oh so bad..."
12633,the servers are awful no tutorial on anything and zombies can pretty much always win. everytime i launch the game the servers break and it automatically quicks. the modes are copy and paste and the weapons you get for a limited amount of days are useless. dont waste your time on this game even if it only 2.1 GB and free.
12634,good game
12635,Best Game EVER !!!!
12636,10/10 Connection to the server has been terminated.
12637,"This game needs some work so far it isnt fun and the zombie mode was just horriable 
Rate 1-10
I give it a 2"
12638,"It's very funny and awesome i like scenario mod is the best!
"
12639,this game is the most fucked up game ive ever played! it says that i need to buy prize preview and i go to shop and type in prize preview and it doesnt find anything! fuck this game it fucking blows! waste of space time and good PC!
12640,"A lot of people are saying that this game is rubbish, but i personnaly think it's ok to start it's free which means micro-transactions but that's easy, most gamemodes don't use the items that you get (that are payed for).  Next the servers *sigh* they disconnect every 30 kins or so but thats mostly in the menus, so far i've never lost connection to the servers while i'm in the game.  Oh also when use lose you have to quit the game and restart it.  Lastly the graphics,  i don't have much for this one apart from they look bad but that doesn't mean that the gameplay is bad.  

Conclusion:
I Like It!!
6/10 
Bad game but i like playing it."
12641,Good for a FTP counter strike game with loads of stuff including crafting but if you own CS GO its not likely to make you switch over for much longer than a bit of a run around.
12642,I dont know why not many people like it. It is better than combat arms insnt?
12643,"The games allright it is a pay 2 win game i can see that with just a few days of playing the game. But to be honest i only droped 2$ on the game to craft a weapon, you dont really have to pay to play the game but if your looking to be on top your sure as hell going to have to put hundreds in the game

Other than the pay 2 win feature i like it, it reminds me of the old counter strike thats on my old windows xp computer in my basement.

i dont have to pay cause i dont feel the need to be on top of the scoreboard. Thats probably why i like it free zombie counter strike mod

If you dont like paying micro payments to get the edge on others dont get the game. If your like me and dont care to be on top get the game its like the old counter strike."
12644,"Its CS with zombies , what can u want more ...maybe a car or a wife or a planet"
12645,Uninstalling was more fun than the game
12646,At least the uninstall button still works
12647,Uninstall simulator 2014!
12648,it says for me that the connection to the server has been lost and i have restarted the game about two times and i get the same message
12649,"Okay, this is gonna be long but i don't care anyways so:
This game is not worth your time.
When i first saw this game, i thought: ""looks like CS 1.6, sure i'll give it a try""
when i played it, it did play like CS 1.6, but some of the additions made it not feel like CS 1.6 at all
Some of the new ""Weapons"" (if you can even call them weapons) added to the game feel so unrealistic, unnatural, and extremely OP, one of them was like a SMG with a scope that had Jesus's face on it (i'm not even kidding), and some more dumb looking weapons

The Zombie Mode is another issue, If you played the CS 1.6 zombie plague mod, zombies usually had arround 1k - 4k HP, here they have arround 15k or something, making it impossible to survive unless you find a really good hiding spot.
and the other Zombie mode being you going from point A to B, going further and killing ""structures"" (called in the Game) that have 2 times more health than a zombie from the first Mode i just mentioned.

and this game has microtransactions too, dumb ones to be exact, like 10 bucks for playing as female charachters, and honestly, I'd rather pay that money to buy the original Counter Strike instead, or hell, any official Counter-Strike game by Valve instead.

Seriously, i'd highly advise you to buy the actual ones instead, don't play this, seriously, it's not fun."
12650,"Terrible. Just terrible. I haven't played such a shit game in a very very long time.

From my experience i could not even change the resolution up to 1920x1080 and it is shit optimized"
12651,Trash!!!
12652,Piece of shit cant join even your own room
12653,THIS IS FUCKING AMAZING 11/10 YOU SHOULD TOTALY PLAY IT
12654,Essentially CS:S
12655,"The mechanics are simplistic, it's an over-hyped hide n seek game, and most people just try to jump to the most impossible spots to reach. I didn't have a lot of fun playing this, but I'll have to try more in the future, to see if there's something I'm missing. The mod was decent enough, but you need to come up with something more contemporary, and less glitchy.

The most annoying part of this game, is constantly clipping on other players, and the map.

The most fun thing about this game, is hiding in a little spot and winning the game of hide n seek.

In summation, it's simplistic, and I didn't find it very entertaining."
12656,"It's like the Plan 9 from Outer Space of video games. only it controls well and has some good maps. Everything else is deliciously stupid.

NOT a replacement for CS:GO though."
12657,"If you are high or drunk, this is the best game to go to. 10/10 would play again if i was crazy"
12658,So cool
12659,Meh.... 10 year old graphics on a ancient game engine.  Not impressed.
12660,"If you hate micropayments, STAY AWAY. I classify this game as a permanent loss for temporary gain. It seems most weapons or something, I lost interest in the game so quickly, have a durability on them, meaning that you only get the item TEMPORARILY. If anyone out there has played puzzle pirates, you know exactly what i'm talking about. In terms of graphics...if you saw THIS trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY9STAlMbwI , then prepare to be disappointed. The game runs on Goldsource, and if you're not familiar with that, it's CS 1.6. That's not insulting Goldsource at all, look at Cry of Fear for crying out loud, that was on the GSRC engine. Many people would be highly disappointed. Gameplay is repetitive, enemies are stock, its all around repetitive. I can't even complain about the bugs of the game because I lost interest in it so quickly that I can't name any. If you like GoldSource games then you may have fun but if not, I wouldn't recommend it.

If you want to play a really good zombie mod, go find No More Room in Hell.

Edit: I've been told that that youtube video is NOT CS:NZ but actually a trailer for Counter strike online: zombie mod 4 darkness, sorry."
12661,"10/10 it's okay





SUPPLAI BAAAX"
12662,Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies? More Like Baricade shooting simulator 2014
12663,Basically its 1.6 F2P but by Nexon and we all know Nexon cant keep a game from being obtained by hackers. This game is pure garbage and i would recommend buying the ORIGINAL 1.6 than playing this wannabe CS 1.6
12664,a somewhat fun game that is pretty bad
12665,"Do not waste your time or internet downloading this. The loading screen is messy, finding a game is messy, buying weapons in game is set out poorly. Once you are actually playing it is when it gets even worse. If you want to play zombies on counter-strike, save your time and get a mod. Counter-strike beta was less buggy and more enjoyable than this. But, if you are a fan of Woodcutting Simulator this game might be up your alley.

It deserves 0.5 out of 10 rubber scats."
12666,The original mode is the only thing I like
12667,"so bad, it hurts."
12668,"""The zombies will be back!""
""The zombies will return!""
""We have been enslaved by the zombies!"""
12669,"+Good Gameplay
-Cheesy diologue 
+Fun Gamemodes
-LAG Issues sometimes
+Zombie escape
+Old School graphics
Verdict 9.1/10"
12670,Changed my life
12671,legit worth
12672,"I cant even play it, it crashes after 5 seconds of it running >:("
12673,"what the heck nexon, you are somehow wanting people to play your game when you put your name on it... is there any more to say on that fact 

if you don't know what nexon is, let me spell it out for you. if Nexon was a knight it would be called ""Sir Nexon Slayer of Everything that makes games playable, killer of wallets, highjacker of good games and lines of games, crusher of hopes and dreams, the uncought bandit, rearing its ugly head only to take annother game and make it its own twisted version.

One day nexon is going to think what if we made a game that you had to pay for... after you buy it... Whoever thought of that instant promotion...

I got a better looking better playing app for my kindle (CSS lookalike) for FREE... (because this game is not free once you start playing)"
12674,"Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like this game, it just has nothing going for it. I'm fine with the outdated engine; I still play Half-Life 1 as if it was a religion. And even though it‚Äôs free to play, I still won‚Äôt be playing this ever again.

The campaign modes are dull and boring with no strategy whatsoever. You just hold the trigger until everything is dead; maybe throw a grenade every now and then. Because you can buy almost anywhere, it was harder to remember to buy during reloading so that you didn‚Äôt break from shooting, then it was to play the game.

It‚Äôs got the original Counter-Strike 1.6 gameplay, but if you wanted to play that then you‚Äôd be better off playing Counter-Strike 1.6.

The ‚Äòpremier‚Äô feature, the multiplayer zombie hunt mode has been done so many times before, and better. It‚Äôs not hard to find better mods for this kind of gamemode. Heck, I‚Äôve played on Counter-Strike Source servers running server scripts that are better than this.

And finally, it has a rather shallow crafting system that seems utterly pointless considering the base game weapons are perfectly fine. Nothing I crafted had longer than a month until expiry and although the game throws heaps of drops at you, it requires specific combinations that are not explained very well at all.

Personally, I just found this boring. It‚Äôs three game modes hashed together and none of them are that good. You‚Äôve basically got Counter-Strike and Left 4 Dead. If you want to play this, go play those games instead."
12675,"The definitive verison of cod zombies / counter strike zombie run.

12676,This game is worse than other F2P shooters that you can find in 5seconds. Not worth the 2gb space...could have had porn there.
12677,it's like if 1.6 got autism
12678,"its ok
"
12679,Thats is a nice Game
12680,I love this game! But i keep disconnecting due to internet issues but im on full bars when i check. Please fix asap. Thanks!
12681,"Game is so bad you wouldn't have a clue what's going on....
I recommend getting a real CS game like CS Source or Global Offensive"
12682,Idk it just feels weird... I dont like the menu screen either.
12683,un .txt?
12684,"As an ex Zombie Server Manager on CS 1.6 (Rank 1 Zombie Server for 2 years on Game Tracker 2009-2011) this is my review: My wish came true! Counter-Strike 1.6 with more guns and more Zombies! Altough I do wish we had Zombie Plague mod in all of the zombie mods there is in Nexon Zomies. Nexon Zombies needs more mods into it, like when a zombie is chosen or when a human is infected, they will have a big splash of blood around them and also scream when they turn into a zombie or spawn as a zombie, Just like in Zombie Plague Mod. Also they should make it so that when a Human has armor, the damage from a zombie will be as much as a knife damage, Slashing = 15 armor damage and Stabbing = 65 armor damage, when having 0 armor 1 hit = infected, but if you're the last human player, they should make it that the last human alive gets hp boosted to 300 and all damage taken by this player will be as normal as a knife damage, ignoring the armor, plus zombies won't respawn if it's 1 human alive. They also need Zombie Maps cause there's not a single zombie map in the game. If they add the original ZP Mod (Not the retarded russian zombie mods like we currently got) I'd be very happy.

Apart of those, I think they should make achievable permanent weapons, like when you achieve level 10 for example you get a Scar-H Permanent, this would make people play even more to achieve weapons!

If it had all of those, the game would be perfect!

P.S: ""The zombies will be back"" and ""We have been enslaved by the zombies"" is driving me nuts and sounds stupid, remove it and replace it with NOTHING."
12685,"Great game!
So many good and funny mods. :)"
12686,"It's a good game for what it has.

It runs on VALVe's older ""GoldSrc"" Engine instead of the new ""Source"" engine, so graphics are not on par.

Its fun because it includes zombies and human modes.

I recommend it."
12687,Worst counter strike ever made on counter strike series... The lag kills a player and god damn the huge hud.
12688,"Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies takes you back to the old CS games.
All it comes down to (depending on the game mode) Zombies vs You
Ive invested alot of hours to say: I like this game a bit more than CS:GO just because its more fun."
12689,cool
12690,"WOW...
I was just going to type that, and leave it at that.  Then I realized that's not a reivew, though it would do it justice.  No doubt many people had HIGH hopes for this game.  Myself included, because I have played since CS: 1.1 before STEAM even existed.  Granted, everyone should know that it's not suppose to be completely serious, like CS:GO.  This game is suppose to be it's immature sibling.  So let me go over a few things in the 3-5 minutes I've attempted playing.

- Overall Review.  As much as I want to recommend others play this game, I couldn't suggest it based off what little I've played.  That is, unless you wish to leave constructive criticism.  I whole heartedly believe this game should be shut down, upgraded, reworked, retweaked, and re-released.  The game in it's current state, has zero potential.  Unfortunately.  It may, at best, slightly amuse extremely bored people.  Now, I'm not here to bash the game with intent to be hurtful.  I want to state what I have to say about it, with my honest opinion.

- Graphics Settings.  Couldn't find a graphic setting that felt comfortable, or natural.  I'm rocking a fairly spec'd out PC, that should not have a single issue, x8 the recommended specs at a minimum.  I tried several screen sizes, and nothing really worked for me.  I suppose it could be the old graphics engine throwing me, but i play CS:1.6 just fine.  Perhaps a 27' LED HDMI 1080p Full HD monitor is too big?  It was free, so... ya know.

- The Engine.  Why wasn't the CS:Source Engine used again?  It's still a killer engine, and I'm sure Valve would have agreed to some sort of terms allowing the company to use it.  The physics alone would have been worth it.  But just the simple fact of using an updated engine would do wonders for this game.  Look at Day Of Defeat Source!  That game is still freaking awesome!  I'm aware the game is ""Free"", but the game is in the risk of ruins dating the graphics so far back.  Dare I say that even using the groundworks for CS:CZ would have greatly improved this game.  All you would have had to do is a bit of tweaking, and recoding.  I mean, that game was built based around bots, and the A.I. skill levels.

- The Mouse Settings.  One of the things I liked the most, are the crosshair types.  That was smooth.  Sure, it's only 4 or 5 types, pixelated, and with an updated engine, the game could impliment several more crosshairs.  HOWEVER, the crosshairs were a failure due to one major pro-tip competitive gamers always have an issue with, the Auto-Adjusting Crosshair (Dynamic Crosshair).  You didn't leave an option to turn that off.  That was a huge quitting point for me.  I understand it's suppose to show the indication of the spread, but I'd rather have my solid crosshairs, watch my spread pattern, burst fire, and adjust my play style accordingly.

- The Music.  Please find a way to auto-off the music once the game/map loads.  I did end up turning the volume down, but realized it annoyed me still, whilst in game.

- The Menu.  Too much clutter.  I've always said at my work, ""a clean work area, runs smoother"".  Expand the menu.  Space things outs.  Make a direct path for each gamemode, objectives, missions, etc...

- The Console.  The Tilde ~ does work to bring up the console, but the known CS commands like ""disconnect"" ""retry"" ""quit"" were not working for me.  Maybe I was missing something I had to do.  As I said, the time I spend in the game was very little, but enough to make me feel compelled to write a review.

As ALWAYS, check out games for yourself.  I read reviews, but often disregard them, feeling my opinions might be different.  Though i'm usually wrong, I still do things that way.  It's Free, so you have nothing to lose."
12691,This game gave me a gun to shoot things!
12692,"graphics are gross, has gamemode from CS:S/CS:GO, really gross"
12693,The opening screen is so large I cannot read the entire screen or see some of the buttons at the bottom. Changing the screen resolution does not effect this apparently. No way to start the game. What a dissapointment.

12710,"A half-life 1 engine game? In 2014? I kind of gathered that there's some sort of retro-fad among indie developers who try to push pixelated graphics, but that is mostly a conscious descision for a certain style. This here looks... well, it would have been cool - 14 years ago. 
Aside from graphics, The game menue is totally overcrowded with submenues, lobbies, crafting areas, awards locations, tech trees and whatnot. You are submitted to a barrage of crafting stuff, consumables, daily missions, weekly missions, ranking, community links and lots of other stuff. And it instantly feels grindy - do 15 daily missions to get these time-limited consumables in order to craft this temporary weapon. Looks like someone had a lot of time to think about all the nice features to create his dream-game (or at least a time-sucking procrastination machine) without actually trying to make the game at least look appealing."
12711,Best game on Steam right now :D
12712,"One word. PERFECT!

It`s a dream game must have, for all those who still love the old version of Counter Strike  1.6.

12715,"Something nonsensical, yet sometimes fun, i would recommend every mode ( there's quite a lot of them ) except humans vs zombies, because it's all about finding map glitches in maps for humans and rushing those holes and eventually win for zombies, plus annoying commentator voice spam. Rush mode is quite fun, especially with friends or people know how to play it, there's also a default Terrorists vs Counter-Terrorists mode with some enhancements. Tons of new weapons, which are fun to use. You can craft items and weapons similar to tf2, but most of items are temporary and sometimes crafting can fail which is not fun. Playing game is very rewarding, you will get a lot of crafting ingredient drops or even item drops. I would recommend it just for fun factor and don't take it seriously. 

There's some problems to be mentioned, like pre game GUI is 1024x768 only ( for me it's also windowed ), no proper widescreen support. I haven't had any problems with anticheat system or disconnection problems, game never crashed for me. And yeah, this is pretty much CounterStrike : Online with minor diffirences and optimized for everyone, you can't complain."

12722,"I like this game , but it isn't looks like a counter-strike game :|"
12723,"I like this game but sometimes I need to know how to kick players if you someone know it please send me a messege.
"
12724,"This game is pretty buggy and looksl ike it was made on unity i just do not recomend ....
"
12725,"Pros:
- Great community (Game developers and players)
One of the greatest community what I ever seen so far. (Blame me about playing mobas) 
- Time to slay some zombies!
That is the reason why I love this game. Absolutely top 3 zombie series in my list (CS Online/NZ, L4Ds and CODs) First time when I saw gameplay video about CS Online zombie mode I really want play that game. I have played couple times in Singapore server already. Now I am really happy that this game is published with less lag.
- Old good 1.6
Now it is good reason play again CS 1.6.
- A lot of players
 One of the most played F2P game in Steam immediately

Neutral:
-P2W
Not every situation. For example: If you have only basic guns and you need better guns in zombie scenario, there are many people who will drop better guns (Balrogs, M2 Browning etc.). But if you want play origins mode, there are couple overpowered guns.

And you don‚Äôt need buy anything necessary. There is an event right now, if you playing the game actively, you will have a chance to craft 72 days-permanent gun couple times.

Cons:
- A lot of bugs
Achievements don‚Äôt work, wrong blueprint in 2‚Ç¨ 72 days-permanent gun crafting and people can‚Äôt log in the game. How that can be even possible? Are those basic things what should work every moment?
- Counter-Strike Online 1?
Seriously, why they publish old game? Nexon has already Counter-Strike Online 2. Online 2 is based from Global Offensive and Online 1 is based from 1.6. Is that only companies‚Äô strategy (Valve, Nexon) that they don‚Äôt compete each other?
- Annoying/stupid tasks in Zombie scenario
Destroy a gate/door which has over 20 k hp with your guns at least two times in one mission. Really? 

I will update this list later but those are first things what were in my mind."
12726,This is basicly Combat Arms pasted into Counter-Strike and I love the counter strike series but it doesnt work well :/
12727,nice game
12728,"this game is a pile of wank, its 2014 and you realease this. really?"
12729,"Waste of time, horrible UX, simply bad, uninstalling right now..."
12730,"Well, this game have the original mods. 
A great option for people who don't have money to buy CS GO. 
It's free, give it a try."
12731,horrible absolutely horrible
12732,Exceptionally poorly made and horribly ballanced piece of ... The original CS 1.6 is far better even for zombie mods...
12733,"In its current state, Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies leaves a lot to be desired. 

Servers:
I'm not sure if this is the case for NA players or those outside Europe in general, but playing this game off a stable internet connection in the European servers was not enjoyable whatsoever. Every few seconds (it varied, really) the server would freeze up briefly, leaving me to struggle to do anything and rendering the game virtually unplayable.

Options, UI and general game stability:
Let's start with options first... And we're done. Honestly; all I could see in the Video section of the Options was the ability to change the resolution, screen display mode (which consisted of 'widescreen' and 'regular' - I've no idea what 'regular' is supposed to mean) and the mandatory brightness/gamma. No advanced options whatsoever. 

Under the audio section you have your usual sliders for SFX Volume and Music (Music I'd recommed you turn right down, as not only is it ear-rapey on first start up, it completely overlaps ingame SFX too), Sound Quality settings (High and Low - no medium?) And a few tickboxes for enabling EAX Hardware Support and A3D Hardware Support (I've no idea what these are either). 

As for Mouse and Keyboard, it's your generic Source Engine options set up, with a depressing lack of 'Raw Input' tickboxes. I suppose it makes up for this with the 'Mouse Filter' tickbox, but it's just not the same.. :( Also, it features rebindable keys for all modes in the game, which was nice to see, abeit it being mandatory anyway. The option to invert the mouse it also included.

The 'Multiplayer' section is the most confusing and deceiving section of this Options menu. Reason being that it appears all nice and fine with it's ability to change crosshair (looks, colour, size and whether you want it translucent or not) and spray settings (yeah, custom sprays!) But then throws in a curveball with it's 'Advanced' section. Put simply, it seems like the Developers had no idea where to put spare options and dumped them in there. In this 'Advanced' section you'll see settings for map objects (like the amount of dropped magazines and bodies on the floor), smoke effect quality and volume, as well as UI settings. There is also a bunch of tickboxes for the radar, as well as ones for ingame options (like the UI)

Speaking of which, the UI is awful. Okay, well maybe not THAT awful, but it's still pretty bad. The buy menus are relatively confusing for first-time Counter Strike players and the UI for your weapons and ammo etc are placed in peculiar locations that require the user to look in certain places to see what they've picked up (thus distracting them from that AWP-er lining their sights up on them). This said, there is an option to set the UI to 'classic' which I assume is supposed to be like CS: Source or 1.6, but I personally didn't notice a difference. 

In terms of stability, the game hold up pretty well. The only times I crashed was when trying to close the game, which didn't matter that much. Though I'd like to mention that changing the resolution will force the game into fullscreen unless you tick the box that enables windowed. About the resolution changes too, I had to reboot the game a couple times to actually see the option for 1920x1080, only to realise that it only changes to that resolution when you're in a match, then to default back to windowed when navigating the main menu (why it does that, I don't know). This game is also awfully hard to ALT+TAB out of while in fullscreen, it'll likely take a good couple seconds (maybe more) to minimise, oddly.

Gameplay: 
The gameplay is fairly standard; shoot Terrorists as Counter Terrorists, plant bomb as Terrorists - usual CS basics right there, so I won't be covering the 'Original' game mode (which only consists of 1 map - Dust II). What this game does bring that is completely unique to CS are the 'Zombies' modes. 

The first, and main, mode (called 'Zombie Scenario') is 'meh', to be honest. It'll usually consist of you buying an M249, walking forward, and holding down right mouse, while occasionally interacting with the objects in the environment to further the mission. This game mode also brings it's own 'story' (for lack of better term) in which you play a set amount of these missions in a linear order. I assume the missions vary in type, but I sadly didn't get far enough through the first one without boring myself to death to experience the others. 

The second, lesser important, mode (called 'Zombie Hero') is essentially stock Counter Strike but with the Terrorists playing as the zombies. Sounds cool, huh? Well it is until you realise that, when playing as 'Terrorists', you'll mainly be hiding around corners or chasing the Counter Terrorists in the hopes of getting a kill before you're inevitable demise and wait period until the next round begins. 

Thankfully, the guns in this game do handle like the ones CS Veterans will be familiar with, sticking true to the CS concepts and basics.

Miscellaneous:
Being a free game, there's most likely going to be strings attached, right? Well yes, that's correct, and Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies comes up far from short on that front. Upon opening the game you'll be barraged with rewards of items that are used in an extremely complicated crafting system (I'll talk about this later) as well as friendly info that there's a shop. In this shop you can spend points that I assume you can earn ingame (this isn't specified) and through paying real money. These points are used for buying items that you're only allowed to use for a set period of time before having to rebuy (you have the option to buy it for 10 days or pay extra for 30 days). You can also spend real money on different player models, weapon packages and xp boosts. 

Crafting: 
Mentioned previously, the crafting system is pretty confusing at first, but easy to get the hang of. It works like unboxing, you put in the 'Blueprints' that contain a set amount of items (they're dropped depending on your play time, and come in numbered tiers - the higher number the better), put in the 'Durable' part (this'll decide how long you get to use your crafted item for) and voila! You get the chance to craft some god-tier item or something really rather useless. On a sidenote, the crafting can actually fail, meaning you lose your Blueprint and Part (seriously man, just like unboxing...)"

12735,"By the way for those who think that there is only zombie modes in this game  there is much much more   and a side note

after playing for 10 hours, and talking to many different players, it is sugg4ested in order to play with any sort of competitive nature, you have to drop $150-$200 a MONTH

The forums moderators in this game are some of the most glass-hearted people in the world.

Literally called this game p2w with weapons that take no skills to use and got banned for ""insulting other players.""

I guess nexon isn't paying them enough to take criticism LMAO
Knowing nexon, they're probably only getting paid 50$ in steam funds a month lul




When you kill someone:

Butthurtkid (usually with bad English): NOOB

lol?

Oh yeah, it's nexon so it's p2w. There are a lot of people saying otherwise because they either got really lucky with the gambling system, or they're just sucking nexon off.

Speaking from someone that played this game for 7 years (other asian versions as well)

not really the same game that came out years ago."
12743,"At least the uninstall button isn't buttraped by Nexon.

Also, if you are going to call a game Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies, think twice about adding in the classic modes."
12744,a very stupid game. only loads dust 2 no zombies poorly optimized and no pussy...
12745,thumbs up
12746,"Not many zombies... not many zombies... let's start off this review with the most riveting sentence ever. Spooky, scary skeletons! Alright, now let me explain. This game has a very old feel to it, and in my opinion, that's good! When I play this game, I can truly say, ""I'm playing the original counter strike right now."" Wanna know why? Cause It's EXACTLY like the first counter strike! EXACTLY. There are barely any zombies and I sure as hell don't remember any samurai swords. What I'm trying to say is that cs:nz has a special cs:go-ish feel to it in the menu, but in the actual gameplay it has a special cs:s feel to it. I've never seen any zombies or any extremely wierd guns but then again, I've only played it for a couple hours so far. When you shoot someone in this game, your rewarded with an explosion of blood, and whenever you kill someone, you hear a deep, loud voice say ""ONE KILL!"" And a thing pops up on your screen that says ""1 KILL"" so when you become a boss at this game and your killing everyone, you will feel proud of yourself. That leads me to my next point as when you first play the game, you instantly become a pro, and I mean INSTANTLY. Ok, maybe not instantly, but after a while. I would highly recommend this game that in all is fun, addicting, distracting, awesome, bloody, amazing and just downright fun.(oh, crap, i already said ""fun"") It's free and awesome, all ready to go for anyone who has the fortune to stumble apon this game in the steam store. Enjoy killing people on the internet, and have a good day!"

12750,"Counter strike Nexon is a interesting entry in the series.... I am honestly surprised valve approved this, it is litterally a modded original counter-strike on steriods. Mind you this originally released back in 2006 running on a 1998 engine in asia with good reviews, only recently did it release to North America. Though it is buggy still and achievments dont work as I write this, it is a repetative fun game. Mind you not only is there new weapon modifications and zombies, you can also play classic Counter Strike, so litterally you are getting a free copy of counter-strike plus mods and other game modes. I recomend this if you want a free counter-strike.  My recomendation for the future of this game is that they make a tutorial because it is very confusing setting up."
12751,"Do not recommend this game, even if it's completely free! I had more fun playing on random zombie escape servers in CS: Source or CS:GO than on this piece of crap. Even L4D1 & 2 were so much better than this piss poor excuse for a ""zombie""-themed game."
12752,this game like others might say is bad but i really injoy it if your a rell cs fan then try it its just fun not bad so its graphics might be a little bad but the gameplay is great i reccimend this game my spelling is bad i know i am dislexic so ples read with respect thank you and try the game after all its free
12753,"Imagine Combat Arms but even worse, sadly, this is what Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is. Do not even bother downloading this, there is no point. Its not even a counter-strike game, which was my first impression."
12754,"RIght off the bat... why the fuck is it running off a cs 1.6 engine in 2014? second of all... do the zambies ever win? it's so laid back and too easy for the humans. The weapon crafting system is a really cool addition. Something the mods in CS;S and 1.6 should have had. Third of all, there aren;t enough zombies. Humans outman the zombies tenfold. Especially since the zombies are so weak and one hit doesn't infect a human. Bottom line, it's just not challenging and I can't enjoy it since the original mods were so competetive and you really wanted to struggle to survive to stay a human. This is also basically a poor people's version of CS: zambies. Just stick to CS:S zambies.

1/10 for some effort. Even though you suck Nexon. Just like how Combat Arms did."

But that is just from my stand point, alot of people dislike the game cause they say its counter strike 1.6 with a couple new weapons and models.

12761,8/8 m8 IGN
12762,cs 1.6 with a bunch of zombie modes included. A good time waster and it's free. Not P2W either. Nexon's usual model is absent. Free stuff is shoved down your throat and you can easily craft weapons and buy perks with in game currency if that is what you are worried about.
12763,"Haven't played much of it, but from what I can gather this is counter-strike 1.6 with some weird zombie type mode included and currency. Also the interface is severely crappy. It just looks like a haphasardly put together game. I do not recommend it at all. There are mich better free alternatives out there."
12764,what the hell is this
12765,Once again nexon uses outdated engines and etc. like really this is 2014 i expected them to acually use an engine from this generation and its using an engine from like 1996. this game looks horrible and is extremly boring and repetive. this game looks nothing like the advertisement i downloaded it thinking that they're using the CS GO engine and it'll be fun to find out its the cs 1.6 engine and is super boring. there may also be in app purchases later on so yea...

12770,"This game is TERRIBE! The game is heavily unbalanced, unfinished, and just all around annoying. the zombies are way to strong as they have triple the health and armor of a human, are near instant kill and have unbalanced abulities that give them all the advantages. The zombie voice overs are so annoying, as every kill and death spams the zombie voice over global (the entire server hears the voices). Continually spamming phrases like ""the zombies will be back"" over and over throughout the entire game. 

The humans are patheticly weak; it take a crowd of humans to kill one zombie in a timely manner (one human takes 5 business days to kill one zombie). you have to spend real money to get more powerful weapons (because crafting them take to long, and may not get you what you want). This game isn't as bad as War Z, but still pretty bad. Go play Zombie Panic, Zombie Master, Killing Floor, or Contagion for a good zombie experience; but leave this game for dead, literally."

12792,"i hate it, mostly because i cant play because it suppossebly need steam(the program which i am litteraly writing this review through) the game looks not bad just wish i could play it"
12793,jesus
12794,"Pointless tat.

Free? yes.
Brings something new (or even old, but good) to the genre?  No."
12795,Currently the resolutions just dont fit right.  The graphics are soo bad also.  Hopefully they fix this.
12796,"1.6 for free!
great if you like playing 1.6.  otherwise.....not."
12797,this game was more fun to uninstall then to play
12798,No.
12799,"It's basically [b]Counter-Strike 1.6[/b] (‚ô•) with slightly improved graphics and gameplay (I really like the crosshair with a dot in the middle) and elements from the famous [i]Zombie Plague[/i] mode, merged with a pay-2-win shop system that [u]really[/u] reminds me of [i]Wolf Team[/i] (and other similar games).  

Yeah, there's a shop system in this game...

...but I'm not going to be a whiny bit·¥Ñh about it (check most of the non-recommended reviews), because I'm not forced to spend money on this, since I can just play on regular 1.6-style servers with all the original characters and weapons. 

A thing that did annoy me about this game is the removal of tons of console commands and the ability to have an own user config (the famous ""autoexec.cfg"") is gone, but I think this can be added in future updates.

--- [b]Edit[/b] ---
I'd like to add that I'm not mad at the shop system: weapons can be crafted so easily without spending real life money (there's even a chance of getting permanent items) and the only ""pay2win"" aspect of the game are some crappy female skins with irritating death sounds that you can quickly frag. Yes, there's people who waste money on that (well, Nexon has to make some profit somehow)."
12800,its shit just shit
12801,worst.
12802,"Just I Want To Tell You Something.Well...This Game Is Very Nice I Mean Its Free.But That Doesnt Matter.Just This FPS Is Perfect I Mean If You Like Counter Strike 1.6 Very Much...Well This Is Your Perfect Game.The Problem Is That This Game Has A Lot Of Negative Reviews But I Dont Know Why.Do You Know? UH! II Almost Forgot,The Weapons! I Mean The Weapons Are Perfect Like You Can Have CLAWS! I MEAN YOU CAN BE WOLVERINE!

12804,"The worst game I have ever played.

Edit: 2019-02-23.
This game has had some improvements but it's still the worst game I have ever played."
12805,.
12806,straight poo like joes mum
12807,"F2P, F2lose. just another way to get money, based off of 1.6. avoid at all costs."
12808,"I came into this game with low expectations, and I got what I expected. It doesn't take long to learn that this is just the old mode from CS thrown into it's own game with cheap microtransactions. To play something else other than the ""normal zombie"" you need to cough up in game currency to use that zombie for about a week, and that's not good for the game's most interesting part. If you really want to play CS zombies, play the original and save yourself some time."
12809,The Next Gen Zombie mode of cs 1.6 =D
12810,Nah...
12811,"What is this shit????
P2W cs for people who are to poor to buy the real one"
12812,"In its current state, Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies leaves a lot to be desired. 

Servers:
I'm not sure if this is the case for NA players or those outside Europe in general, but playing this game off a stable internet connection in the European servers was not enjoyable whatsoever. Every few seconds (it varied, really) the server would freeze up briefly, leaving me to struggle to do anything and rendering the game virtually unplayable.

Options, UI and general game stability:
Let's start with options first... And we're done. Honestly; all I could see in the Video section of the Options was the ability to change the resolution, screen display mode (which consisted of 'widescreen' and 'regular' - I've no idea what 'regular' is supposed to mean) and the mandatory brightness/gamma. No advanced options whatsoever. 

Under the audio section you have your usual sliders for SFX Volume and Music (Music I'd recommed you turn right down, as not only is it ear-rapey on first start up, it completely overlaps ingame SFX too), Sound Quality settings (High and Low - no medium?) And a few tickboxes for enabling EAX Hardware Support and A3D Hardware Support (I've no idea what these are either). 

As for Mouse and Keyboard, it's your generic Source Engine options set up, with a depressing lack of 'Raw Input' tickboxes. I suppose it makes up for this with the 'Mouse Filter' tickbox, but it's just not the same.. :( Also, it features rebindable keys for all modes in the game, which was nice to see, abeit it being mandatory anyway. The option to invert the mouse it also included.

The 'Multiplayer' section is the most confusing and deceiving section of this Options menu. Reason being that it appears all nice and fine with it's ability to change crosshair (looks, colour, size and whether you want it translucent or not) and spray settings (yeah, custom sprays!) But then throws in a curveball with it's 'Advanced' section. Put simply, it seems like the Developers had no idea where to put spare options and dumped them in there. In this 'Advanced' section you'll see settings for map objects (like the amount of dropped magazines and bodies on the floor), smoke effect quality and volume, as well as UI settings. There is also a bunch of tickboxes for the radar, as well as ones for ingame options (like the UI)

Speaking of which, the UI is awful. Okay, well maybe not THAT awful, but it's still pretty bad. The buy menus are relatively confusing for first-time Counter Strike players and the UI for your weapons and ammo etc are placed in peculiar locations that require the user to look in certain places to see what they've picked up (thus distracting them from that AWP-er lining their sights up on them). This said, there is an option to set the UI to 'classic' which I assume is supposed to be like CS: Source or 1.6, but I personally didn't notice a difference. 

In terms of stability, the game hold up pretty well. The only times I crashed was when trying to close the game, which didn't matter that much. Though I'd like to mention that changing the resolution will force the game into fullscreen unless you tick the box that enables windowed. About the resolution changes too, I had to reboot the game a couple times to actually see the option for 1920x1080, only to realise that it only changes to that resolution when you're in a match, then to default back to windowed when navigating the main menu (why it does that, I don't know). This game is also awfully hard to ALT+TAB out of while in fullscreen, it'll likely take a good couple seconds (maybe more) to minimise, oddly. 

Gameplay: 
The gameplay is fairly standard; shoot Terrorists as Counter Terrorists, plant bomb as Terrorists - usual CS basics right there, so I won't be covering the 'Original' game mode (which only consists of 1 map - Dust II). What this game does bring that is completely unique to CS are the 'Zombies' modes. 

The first, and main, mode (called 'Zombie Scenario') is 'meh', to be honest. It'll usually consist of you buying an M249, walking forward, and holding down right mouse, while occasionally interacting with the objects in the environment to further the mission. This game mode also brings it's own 'story' (for lack of better term) in which you play a set amount of these missions in a linear order. I assume the missions vary in type, but I sadly didn't get far enough through the first one without boring myself to death to experience the others. 

The second, lesser important, mode (called 'Zombie Hero') is essentially stock Counter Strike but with the Terrorists playing as the zombies. Sounds cool, huh? Well it is until you realise that, when playing as 'Terrorists', you'll mainly be hiding around corners or chasing the Counter Terrorists in the hopes of getting a kill before you're inevitable demise and wait period until the next round begins. 

Thankfully, the guns in this game do handle like the ones CS Veterans will be familiar with, sticking true to the CS concepts and basics.

Miscellaneous:
Being a free game, there's most likely going to be strings attached, right? Well yes, that's correct, and Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies comes up far from short on that front. Upon opening the game you'll be barraged with rewards of items that are used in an extremely complicated crafting system (I'll talk about this later) as well as friendly info that there's a shop. In this shop you can spend points that I assume you can earn ingame (this isn't specified) and through paying real money. These points are used for buying items that you're only allowed to use for a set period of time before having to rebuy (you have the option to buy it for 10 days or pay extra for 30 days). You can also spend real money on different player models, weapon packages and xp boosts. 

Crafting: 
Mentioned previously, the crafting system is pretty confusing at first, but easy to get the hang of. It works like unboxing, you put in the 'Blueprints' that contain a set amount of items (they're dropped depending on your play time, and come in numbered tiers - the higher number the better), put in the 'Durable' part (this'll decide how long you get to use your crafted item for) and voila! You get the chance to craft some god-tier item or something really rather useless. On a sidenote, the crafting can actually fail, meaning you lose your Blueprint and Part (seriously man, just like unboxing...) 

To conclude this lengthy review (and give those too lazy a brief TL;DR), I wouldn't recommend Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies until the Developers can add incentives to make waiting for the download to finish worth it. Though, if you have the internet to download it quickly, go ahead and give it a try. Who knows? You might find enjoyment out of it.

Thanks for reading."
12813,What a load of old shit

[Es] Opini√≥n escrita por chat a un amigo.
Solyc: El CSNexon me gusta porque son modos de juego nuevos para el CS antiguo, es mi tipo de juego (similar al Sven Coop). La verdad es que no se nota el P2W, tampoco es para tanto. El juego tiene algunas cosillas ""mal hechas"", pero para mi eso es parte del encanto (estuve 1h15min para destruir un ""Osprey"" en un modo de juego de todos contra la IA) Por suerte al Osprey se le ve√≠a como le bajaba la vida muy poco a poco (con una barra), porque sino cualquiera pensaba que era imposible
Solyc: Y te dan premios por hacer mapas y cumplir misiones; premios que gastas en crear nuevas armas. Est√° bien el sistema de recompensas.
Solyc: Y por √∫ltimo, tiene cosas koreanas raras (por ejemplo hay un personaje de piel negra y pelo rubio)."
12822,horrible...
12823,"This game is amazing, if you dont't like good games."
12824,But when i try to start the game than it tells me that ''This game requires Steam.''
12825,this game got me hard
12826,"This is not a game for everyone!

I personally enjoy this game, something I can get into unlike most others who appear to dread this.
Maybe because I've played the Chinese CS:O (Counter-Strike: Online) back in 2011 and I got into it.

It may become P2W (Pay 2 Win) in future if it follows suit to it's original Asian counter parts.
There is quite a bit of grinding to do to get ahold of resources to create the good stuff if you don't want to pay out. More grinding than Destiny!"
12827,I went in this knowing it was going to be shitty but it was so shitty that it backfired and the servers wernt up thats how shitty this game is nexon made another fucked fps i was fine with them makeing horrid ass combat arms but to try to fuck up Counterstrike my childhood game thats just terrible
12828,It's still pretty fun in 2019.
12829,Not enough time on zombies with humans. for humans to get ready or get to there area. not enough time to buy your weapons. weapons do not push zombies back far enough. the zombie turning sound is to repetitive and gets annoying. to many zombies spawn in beginning. Basically if u want a counter strike zombie game buy css and play zombie mod. the Devs should of taken a page from that and done it like on css and other ones that have been modded. Other then those problems its great. btw jack the time up for zombie pvp matches to 10 minutes.
12830,dafuq? O.o
12831,"I didn't even study gamedesign, I just know how it works.

It's a mystery to me how professional gamedesigners don't realise that the whole Zombies vs Humans gamemode is pretty flawed because
1. Any player with a brain will find that one spot on the map where the zombies won't reach them making it a boring camping game for the humans and a boring dull Charge-and-get-killed type of gameplay for the zombies
2. Because the players are smart enough to hide at the one spot zombies have a hard time getting there especially because they can bodyblock eachother, let's use the spot on the roof on italy for example, you have to do a little bit of jump and run to get on top of there and I keep getting pushed off by my teammates because they cant wait, and even if they would wait, I'd get shot by the players in about 2 secons. Now if all the zombies could jump up there at the same time it would be a different story but I think bullets penetrate in this game too so nevermind.

This could be improved by giving the zombies some sort of grenade per spawn but I didn't see anything similiar while playing.

Also I'm frustrated that gamedevs apparently yet need to realise that we'll gladly give them money if the game is worth it, not when they force us to buy equipment."
12832,"Counter-Strike 1.6 or Counter-Strike: Online with a bunch of game modes like Survival, ZM, a DayZ/Rust styled game mode and a few others along with an ugly reskined menu UI and an option to report a player for 'Curse word'. Not to mention some of it is pay to win, hence why it's free. Did they need to make this? No. Was it worth it? No. Not at all."
12833,"funny way to spend few minutes when you are bored :D
Bad thing is that it is only copy paste of CS 1.6 and just reskinned few th√≠ngs and added some ''Free to play'' shit on top of it, which is like: If you want to look $W4GGY, buy a skin for 10‚Ç¨!

So, i would reccomend this just to try it.

12838,"[i]Hello, Gabe NeweII here.

As you all know, we developed unique gaming mechanism for sucking money from teenagers for stupid stuff like didldo pink painted AK47 and banana stickers. We are utterly proud of CS:GO.

Sadly, lot of backward thinking people who care only about gameplay are still not switching to this wonderfull instalment. I am talking about CS1.6 loyalists. When you look at [url=http://store.steampowered.com/stats/]our stats[/url], old ""Counter-strike"" is still in the top 10 played games. So we deciced to do something trully unique.

We took the 12 year old engine, slapped the market on it and made it freetoplay. This way we can sell skins and weapons even in this decade old game - and actually make more money! We have not fixed any of the [url=http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/7704-CS_16_bugs_detailed]50 bugs present[/url]. Only think we care about is market, as you can see from the updates. Heck, who even cares about community anyway? On the top of that we wrapped the whole game, so you can not use any of the [url=http://cs.gamebanana.com/]5000 skins, maps, and mods present on gamebanana[/url]. After all, why would we want from you to use [url=http://cs.gamebanana.com/skins/133164]free asiimov awp skin[/url], when you can pay for one? Or instead of realisticly looking terorist, why wouldn't you pay 13.99 euro for model of a girl in stockings?

After all, that is what counter-strike is all about. Shooting chicken with ridiculously painted gun and paying for it.

12849,This is a very thin attempt by Valve to turn CS 1.6 into Killing Floor - with all the campers and broken game mechanics that you could ever possibly want.
12850,"Read all the reviews, thought, ""How bad could it be?"" Downloaded the 2G file, and then upon launch was greeted with a shop screen and all these free blueprint things with no explanation whatsoever. Taking that into account, I played a solo game, and sat for 10 plus minutes destroying a barricade before hundreds of zombies poured out of everywhere with no warning and killing me. Then, I played on another map. Same thing, tons of zombies, little to no ammo, and then death. This game is awful, -1/10"
12851,"Sorry but i can not recommend this Title.
Not Fun!"
12852,"""FREE TO PLAY"" more like ""FREE TO START. Then lets squeeze every last penny out of the CS 1.6 engine."" I would recommend that you just go buy CSS and play the zombies servers there."
12853,"Zombies.

Everyone loves zombies, which is why truely inspirational, spiritual journeys such as Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies exist. 

With mind bogglingly strong boxes you'll be holding down left mouse click for hours at a time, you might think this is a 'boring' or 'mundane' concept HOWEVER with the literal piles of zombies swarming you constantly said mechanic becomes truely delightful.

Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies also has majestic boss battles with original mechanics like 'constantly insta-killing you and knocking your weapon out of your hands' mechanics like these show that the video game franchise as a whole as grown and ascended past it's 8-BIT era."
12854,"This game...
Imagine if you will, beating your head against the wall, over and over and over. And then you mostly have the contents of this game.

Based off CS 1.6 this game forces you to kill boxes, with many thousands of hitpoints, 15,000-30,000, and this was pretty unbearable, but then imagine that the makers decided that having the amount of damage dealt to these boxes scales down with the amount of people in the game. When you eventually get to a ""boss"" it is simply one of the aforementioned boxes that does an insignificant amount of damage per attack, but suddenly will use it instant kill move. To give perspective, it can use this move with no consequence, no warning, and no escape, even right as you respawn it can do it. 

The makers of this game clearly thought that harder difficulty=higher amount of enemy health, and even on easy difficulty this game is a rediculous waste of time, that will bore you to pieces while you shoot boxes blocking the path."
12855,"wow. just wow. I wanted to try it before i will say something bad xD
So first game started in some kind of window full of text and shit and idk and it was bigget then my screen so i was not
able to press buttonsin down part of screen. So big mess in that window. wtf where is singleplayer? I clicked on shop.. all old shit stuff are for free but if u want sexi natasha girl skin it cost 10 $  xDDD lol gameplay looks horrible. totaly shit.
Am shocked how horrible it is. Menu box looks so ""modern"" and then gameplay and all suck. I know that they basicaly used old CS game. but still they sould chenge at least something. Textures of new guns looks like 5 years old kid was doing it.
Really poor shit."
12856,"I used to play Counter-Strike Source ages ago, it is nice to see a similar game for free.
The zombie modes are pretty cool, however the Zombie scenario takes some time to complete!
The fun modes are hilarious as I never played a football match in Counter-Strike before.
There are also more classic modes, so there is something to do for everyone.

Since it is free to play there is a cash shop, but it is not bother me as I can create my own weapons myself without having to pay for anything.

I recommend you game this game a chance! For an old CS:S player, this game is quite refreshing and fun!"
12857,Love it!
12858,0/10 would never play again......
12859,Runs only as Administrator? Rubbish. Avoid.

12861,this game is scary and cool
12862,"This August inadvertently turn
:c"
12863,"Alright look. There are a lot of bad reviews about this game but im going to give you an honest good one.

This game is free, and for a free game it's pretty damn good. The graphics are the old 1.6 but the gameplay is amazing. The community is yet to show me a bad side and all the guns are pretty even. Everything in the cash shop can just be earned through playing the game, the cash shop is just a quicker way of getting it. The game rewards the players who work for their guns. You can level up and get better as you play. If you want a free counter strike, it doesnt get better than this. and if you want a bit of a nostalgic feeling of the old counter strike, this will remind you. You can listen to the reviews complaining about ""Paying for guns"" and just putting a bad rep on nexon and all the sort. But the truth is, you get what you get. It's a free game and all free games have their ups and downs. And this one definetly has more ups than downs. It's worth the download.  People also need to remember, this game just came out. It still has plenty of room for updates and the like. Who knows, a ton of stuff could be changed in the future. Most of the haters are probably just call of duty players that wanted something like a free COD. but if you're a hardcore Counter Strike player, or even someone new to it, this is a great learning curve, and experience. I ask you, Give this a try.

"
12864,"I got an achievement and a bunch of free items for ""playing for 10 minutes"". I felt like I'd earned them."
12865,wow :D
12866,The uninstallation is strong with this one.
12867,I have to say Black Ops Zombies is better and cod is better because of trickshoting so ya.
12868,"Not that bad. Like a zombie mode in 1.6 with different menu and what not. Pretty much exactly like 1.6 except zombie only. No connection problems like other people stated.
"
12869,"Only if Nexon released the game earlier, maybe it would've been better, but no; the game uses an outdated engine (which i don't techinally mind if i were making an indie shooter game), the cursor detection on buttons from message boxes are inaccurate, and i can barely see the botton HUD."
12870,"I don't understand why so many people gave this a bad rating, it's a super fun game that is really enjoyable, my 1.5 hours on this game were a blast, I love it!"
12871,ben suht uper
12872,"This crap, do no bother"
12873,"Easily the worst CS-related game I've ever seen. I have hundreds of hours of CS:GO, 1.6, etc. This is pure trash."
12874,"This would probably be alright if it was released between 1999-2001

No idea why they used CS 1.X instead of Source

Looks and feels bad - and it's not because of graphics fidelity. The realistic CS models are out of place in this new fantasy zombie arcade shooter. It looks like they just took CS clean out of the box and copy/pasted Korean styled zombies, monsters & aliens on top

""No More Room in Hell"" is and infinately superior zombie shooter."

they can do better
"
12876,"this game was fun till i realized that weapons that you craft have a time limite like i just today got a mini gun but only for 7 days and if you played bot team deathmatch its like bots can see you even in cover come on not cool!!



   fix the problems im talking and i mite consider changing my reveiw: 
   first make it so bots canot always see you' secound make it so that crafted things stay forever insted of going away in a day or a week

more things wrowith the game is coming"
12877,This game is poor. Even by free to play standards. The interface is confusing. It's hard to even get into a game. And once I did it was worse than a facebook fps shooter. Move along. Nothing to see here.
12878,Just awful. Interminable music that just won't quit. Requires admin to run. Horrible pings due to games being listen servers. What's not to hate?
12879,Really Boring and crappy zombie game. WarZ is better than this.
12880,"Disgusting. The graphics look horrible, even compared to CS 1.6. This is by far the worst looking game created. The controls feel clunky the spread is horrible compared to the original CS. When playing a regular game you are far too close to the ground it feels like your an oompa loompa. 3/10 completely horrible."
12881,Same old free to play shooter with crafting.  Not really worth your time unless you are too cheap to buy CS1.6

12883,Bugs+Pay2Win=Fish
12884,im sure it'll take me longer to uninstall this game than it took the devs to make it
12885,"just another terrible free to play zombie game from nexon, I understand it's free to play but this ""free to play"" it's not really a free to play , you pay with the wasted 10 minutes you invest in this pathetic excuse of a game."
12886,wow
12887,"Great Game its my First Counter Strike Game and It's Real Fun I think you would all enjoy it.
I Give it a 9/10 because its great i would give it a 10 if it would be a little low end. :D"
12888,This shit sux better buy cs 1.6 and play zombie mod not this crap!
12889,its a odd game at first but it is a lot of fun!
12890,When you play you better turn your volume down because it is just a cluster fuck of sounds. zombies are over powered
12891,"They could've done way better, even for a free to play game, like everythings a mess and its like a game back in the year 2000 or in the 1990s.  Everythings a mess and it's basically just straight up killing zombies....thats it, such a waste of time"
12892,Great it reminds me of the other ones you should get it plus it is free. XD
12893,"Not just Zombies, Original CS too!!!"
12894,"THIS GAME IS GREAT! ITS NOT LIKE OTHER F2P'S WHERE YOU GET ONE GUN AND THEY SEND YOU TO YOUR SLAUGHTER! NO, THIS GAMES GIVES YOU TONS OF GUNS TO GET YOURSELF GOING AND YOU CAN START WRECKING FACES FAST!"
12895,"I once played with my shit in the toilet, it was better than this sadly. To be fair the shit was kind of fun to play with."
12896,"Take CS:CZ, add a bunch of wacky gun mods, throw in some zombie mods, and you get CSN:Z. A fairly enjoyable experience thus far, no hackers, community is nice for an F2P game, and there's no P2W (not quite yet anyway. Keep in mind this IS a Nexon game...)"
12897,"Played for a bit, but had one urge, to play Sven Coop again and never touch this game again, fuck this game...."
12898,"Is there a way to remove the 0.1 hour from my profile and act like I never played this game. Seriously though this game is so funny to me, that literally I died with-in the first 2 second of the start up screen. Literally when I saw all the ads popping up and all the Social Media references. Once thoses laughs were out of the way I literally went through finding a server... 

Now being a old school Combat Arms player, I literally notice a shitload of references up the butthole, like literally my ass was clinching to the chair to the fact of how much shit they copied off Combat Arms so far, but don't worry... It doesn't end there. When I click the loading screen, it literally felt like I was playing Combat Arms again and the laughs has came back... 

After a another couple of minutes of laughing so hard, I finally start moving the mouse in-game... Btw the game goes full screen when you enter a server... so that's a feature I haven't seen from Combat Arms or Counter-Strike... *Kappa* Then when I enter a team, which btw there a shitload for some odd reason... then you go straight into the action. From there you literally feel the Counter-Strike nostalgia come at you. But it doesn't end there... when I started getting kills you begin to notice the kill counter pop ups AND LITERALLY--- It's the exact same as Combat Arms like literally a CLONE... all they need is the noises it makes when you get multiple kills and BAM!!!! You got yourself a perfectly rip-off of Combat Arms.

Now as for the players... Well I only played 1 game, and here was most of the questions being ask, ""What is the point of this game?"" , from there the laughs got real again. To tell you the truth, the only thing 'original' and I used the word 'original' very small in this case... is the actual zombies MAYBE.... JUST MAYBE... who knows somewhere for counter-strikes mods I can literally find the skins they use for the game... In that case... Riperino....

So... now were at the point of what I should give the game as a review... Hmm---- what to give, what to give... hmm

10/10 

""No game is perfect."""
12899,"Complete crap, dont touch this garbage."
12900,"all games are css original,1 shot zombies,no good bosses,4 zombies that suck ass and are all cosmetics except 1,bad players,almost no players............ -10/10"
12901,"I dont recommend this game at all

Pros.
1) There are plenty servers.. So you can always play at anytime
2)  It is a free version of cs 1.6
3) Decent zombie skins

Cons.
1) Poor interface. 
2) You just run into a map , where Bot zombies spawn all the time and you either shoot zombies or walls . Pointless.
3) Poor maps
4) Poor buy menu
5) Poor gameplay . 

What i recommend?
- Just either skip this game and play Left 4 Dead 1 , 2 or zombie mode on cs 1.6 , source , go."
12902,"When I was playing this game i didn't even see one zombie, piece of shit"
12903,It's good
12904,At least the uninstall button doesn't require you to pay $$...
12905,"This is a terrible very incomplete feeling game. THe design is terrible, the performance is horrid even on modern machines, and worst of all- its not fun."
12906,it was pretty f**king bad...
12907,Worst idea to mix and executed poorly looks out-dated too which is no surprise. There is a crafting system which gives you limited time to use the equipment till you have to remake or or repair it again with this retarded durability system. Plus when I did try it out it was nothing more then a worser version of counter-strike if you added zombies into it. I only played this for a few minutes and the gameplay is terrible even when playing as zombies which is even worse from first-person view. This doesn't even deserve to even be called a game!
12908,Don't try this game out
12909,practically cs 1.6 but for people lazy to add a zombie mod so they did it for you
12910,Can't shoot chickens -10/10
12911,"hahaha soo poor! this game is a disgrase for the name 'Counter Strike'
it looks like a normal zombie mod from cs1.6 why do nexon make a full game of that shit?
they have no more money or what?
shame on you nexon xD
"
12912,"so broken rite now
"
12913,10/10 fuk u tom
12914,fun zombie cs game i like the modes
12915,"this games bullshiet if u want a shitty ripoff of cs then yeah its good but other than that its complete shit
"
12916,"This is one of the worst experiences I've ever had in video games.
10/10"
12917,"roses are red, violets are blue, if you like counterstrike, this games not for you!"
12918,"This is (obviously) just the kind of game where you're supposed to pay to get all the weapons and the ""this is a classic"" feeling is just not there. The weapon sounds are dull and you'll wonder what that background sound is, then notice it's an annoying soundtrack song that doesn't fit."
12919,"""Fire in the hole"" Simulator"
12920,best game ever
12921,So stupid
12922,No... Just... No
12923,This game is broken it does not work PLZ do not download it is for your own good i am just trying to wright a helpful review    (this review is LEGIT)
12924,not what I expected.
12925,This game has a variety of fun and refreshing game modes that will keep you entertained for long periods of time 9/10
12926,"I played this game, I was like, Ohh no it can't be as bad as the reviews are saying it is. Well, Its way worse. Not only is there a Cashshop market, but you sit in the corner spending all your time shooting buying the same gun over and over again, then 40 minutes later, the round ends, you feel like you did NOTHING. It was boring as all hell, and there is pretty much 0 reward at the end. No achivement, no real victory, you don't win anything, it doesn't even say you WIN. It just says Round over. HORRIBLE GAME
ITS WORSE THEN THE REVIEWS SAY, VAVLE SHOULD DEMAND A REFUND FROM THEM FOR RUINING THE CS TITLE"
12927,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."
12928,"WOW... I thought this would be a cool version of CS and that Nexon would just throw some cool stuff in like the Zombie mod.. I was confused at first since there is zombie mods you can set on any CS game but figured they implamented some  stuff to make it cooler or did something that would make the game appealing.

This game blows so much D and Nexon looks like a joke trying to get a free ride off of CS's back!

I actually played Combat Arms and enjoyed that game when it fisrt started which they added to much p2w type content on but this game is terrible to start.

I saw a few cool things that might have enhanced the play but it is so glitchy and seems like a poor knockoff of CS 1.6 so I don't even want to try playing anymore.. I wanted to leave a few seconds in but stayed a complete match after having issues even getting in.

This is a huge insult to CS games, They should have just revamped Combat Arms and threw zombie mode on it or something. I really don't see how CS even allowed this to happen but I guess it gives people a free option to try out CS.. If CS wanted to get some people into them they should have just made 1.6 free and dropped the price on Source..."
12929,Sh** as hell
12930,"(Wonder why I give it a positive rating? Read the whole review.)
This game pisses me off.
It's almost a pay to win game, I say almost because you can still obtain the rarer guns just by logging in and completing some missions. However, the ""Points"" system still hinders you to where you need to grind like a motherfu*ker to get the sufficant points to GET A CHANCE to get the ""good guns"". With the crafting system comes weapons that do nothing and weapons that are literally a godsend, even if you have a godgun, it runs on a temporary system, meaning YOU HAVE LIMITED DAYS TO USE THE GUN. Yes there are 72 day-Pernament materials but it's very rare to get OR you can pay for it. 
Another thing that pisses me off is how SLOW it takes to level up. I almost clocked in a day AND i played the OBeta and i'm a level 7. Sure there are EXP Cupons and EXP Boost weekends, but the time it takes to reach these levels are horrendus, especually when you get a crate that you can't open because of your low level. 
To add to the hard time it takes to rank up, you can be disconected from the current server your playing on! Even if you have a good connection, it's still possible that you can be disconnected, and once you do, YOU DO NOT GET XP AND LOOT DROPS. It's punishing when you play for a good hour on a zombie senario mission to get some points to craft a weapon you want, and you disconnect randomly for no reason, RIGHT BEFORE THE BOSS DIES. This happened to me more than 10 times now. I've checked my ping, and it was locked at around 30. 
Another thing that just urkes my shit is when I'm playing zombie hero type modes, and it takes forever to kill the enemy zombies. I understand if the first few zombies need 7000 HP, so they can infect others, however, this becomes an issue because most of the guns can't match the Zombies HP, meaning most of the LMG's and like 1 assault rifle is useful! Pistols, shotguns, and sniper rifles are almost useless, I say almost because guns do slow enemies, some even knock back so it can buy you time. ANOTHER thing that gets annoying is the announcer voice in Zombie Hero mode, it says ""The Zombies Will Be Back"" EVERY TIME SOMEONE DIES, which means YOU HEAR THAT MOTHERFUCKA 32 TIMES MAX. 

However...

I still keep coming back.
Why, you may ask?
Well, even with all of these issues, i'm still hooked. It reminded me of the good ol' times on consoles with private matches on CoD and some servers on CS:S. The gameplay is addicting, you want to survive and fight the hoards of enemies with your friends, and finish the fight with a raid boss. You want badass weapons that your friends have, so you keep fighting the issues to obtain the items needed to craft the weapon. There are enchantments to make your guns and even your zombie character (ZH Mode) even better. There are different species of zombies, and each come with different abilities. You can join a ""family"" (A clan, basically) and interact with them and play with them. There are ranked modes, and you have a sperate rank in seperate modes, so you can brag who's better according to ranks. And finally, the game comes with a free CS 1.6. Yeah, a free CS 1.6.

Honestly, I can only complain but in the end it's your choice to try it out or not. I'm giving it a positive rating because first of all, it's free to play, and second, I want you to experience the game itself, and from there you can say if the game blows or not. Much like movie critics, someone can say it sucks, and they maybe right, but who knows if you like it until you watch it.

This game isn't perfect, but still worth a shot."
12931,"This game will pull all the money from your pockets as there is no real ingame currancy just points that cannot be spent up purchacing items but parts to make items for a time limit along with the ""classes"" are 2.99 for 30 days. If you want to play this it would be much better to play a modded server on CS/CS:S/CS:GO"
12932,Its pretty much shit
12933,10/10 nice 1
12934,bad
12935,"First off most of the bad reviews are from the open beta a month ago. so dont really pay much attention to them                                              
Second this game is fun to play and it counter strike and it's FREE!!. i really had a lot of fun playing a lot of diffrent game modes to choose from cool guns and a lot of zombies to kill thats allways fun to do so dont worry if your going to hate it
chances are you might like it so stop reading reviews and just get it all ready it is free after all and kill hundres of zombies"
12936,"Buggy, unbalanced, unfinished and just plain shit."
12937,There is many obvious flaws in this game but the base game is good.... but making the zombies stop when they get shot.... not a good idea.. 3/10
12938,good loook
12939,this game brings so much fun through my high school life it is fun and there is something new every day to bring to the battle front.
12940,No
12941,"The game is ok! Its a chill out, arcade style zombie-themed shooter. The game would appeal mostly to older gamers like me. If your first shooter was Call of duty Modern Warfare,chances are you wouldn`t like it. If however you started by Doom, Quake, Half-life, etc. you will enjoy this. Just don`t try to take the game seriously it isn't meant to be. 

Its is a good, relaxing game where you could ""release your anger"" while shooting hundred different weapons at numberless hordes of zombies. One thing i didn't like in this game is the very repetitive nature. There are different waves of zombies, yet they are indistinguishable. Also there may be 100 different guns, yet they are basically all the same. 

The crafting technique for acquiring the custom weapons is somewhat cool. You can also upgrade the weapons you have.

Give this game a chance, its free ware after all !"
12942,"What does it have in similarity to normal counter-strike?
Well... Um... There is 2 teams, CT and T and there are the classic maps like Dust 2.
And well, the gamemode is kinda the same. There are no zombies though, even though it's in the title of the game.

Don't know what I expected, but not this...

Looks and feels like it's based on the goldsrc engine a.k.a. the CS 1.6 engine and not the newer Source engine, which is weird..."
12943,"its FREE to play, no aus servers, would b a great game if it wasnt for the 300ping 7/10"
12944,"Just amazing, the graphics are superb, sounds are something I have never seen before, it's just amazing and everyone should play it. Oh wait, i forgot to tell you, I'm talking about the uninstallation."
12945,"gg nexon.

the game didnt even start.
i was waiting 10 mins and then i had to terminate the task

booo"
12946,"While Counter Strike is fun, whatever this game claims to be is not. The game in itself is horrible, especially in its balance of zombies vs humans. Humans are OP if they group together in a small space and just spam gunfire towards the horde, since bullets have infinite knockback that prevent you from getting close. Zombies are, as well, overpowered due to the one-hit physic and have an insane amount of health, along with the ""revive"" mechanic when landing a headshot is near-impossible.

I would say this game needs work, but as broken as it is right now, it just needs to be deleted in its current form and redone a completely different way. You cannot fix the current form without changing it entirely."
12947,"if you want a free to play css then stick to original, if you want a free to play zombie game check out zombi panic source (i think thats f2p) if you want a pile of shit then this is the game for you, its a peice of crap on the gaming world and taking the counter strike name in vein just EWWWW if you installed it you poor bastard, if you plan on installing it dont bother its a waste of time"
12948,Just sad
12949,"At first glance this may seem like a free version of Counter-Strike: Source, and at a closer glance may seem like Counter-Strike meets Left 4 Dead, but this game is far more complex than that.

For starters, this game [i]is[/i] based on CS:S, and essencially still plays like traditional CS, with terrorists and counter-terrorists. It's the addition of the zombies that makes all the different forms of play so unique.

For those who just want to play CS without having to worry about the zombies, the Original mode is just that: Counter-Strike. Even has good old de_dust2.

The Zombie Scenario mode plays similar to Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, where there is one team, either terrorists or counter-terrorists, and another team of computer-controlled zombies. You reach the end and fight a boss. Simple. 

Oh yeah, and there are obstacles you have to shoot down with your guns. They have a lot of HP. You'll find yourself running back to the restocking area to get more ammo a lot.

As you complete the mission and kill zombies, a bar on the bottom of the screen fills up. When it is completely filled, you level up, giving you more HP and more ammo. Keep in mind, this level up system is exclusive to this mode and is separate from your global level.

The Zombie Hero mode plays similar to Left 4 Dead Versus. One team is the humans, the other team is the zombies. You can choose to be either humans or zombies.

Most of the items you can get just by playing or crafting. Sure, there is a store, but the items for the most part do not require real world money. You purchase some items, such as new characters, [i]with[/i] real-world money, yes, but most items are purchased with points.

And you also get these points by playing. Playing X time gives you Y points, playing X more time gives you Z points. Simple.

There are also missions you can choose to complete every day and every week. Beating one of these missions gives you a reward: either a random gun or random crafting materials, your choice.

Overall, this game piqued my interest when I found it a few weeks ago, probably before it started coming into beta. I dare say that this may be one of the best F2P games on Steam."
12950,Basiclly C:S 1.6 for free if you ignore the weird micro-transaction stuff and the zombie mode. The menu has all these werid rankings and drawings of wonem telling you to buy stuff as you play. But if you shut your eyes until the game starts you shouldn't have any promlems. 9/10 - 2/10 for the Cod ranks.
12951,"Terrible. Out-dated engine, square arena's, really bad zombie spawing and horrendous game play. Wouldn't reccomend; what so ever..."
12952,"There is an arse ton of micro-transactions
There are too many glitches, given it was released yesterday
It's literally a copy of the first Counters Strike, just flooded with zombies (what every game needs)
It's shit
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) 

7/10 just because I don't give tens
"
12953,"this game is okay, besides the horrible AI zombies i think this is a good average counter strike i dont see the hate on this but hey were all different gamers"
12954,Classic CS with ******* P2W elements.
12955,"I only had ""FUN"" downloading the game."
12956,Barely works?  Re-used and poor art assets.  Unable to change game resolution out of game.  Waited for a game session 3 mins and saw it come up in the client notice txt chat box that it had already clocked me as having played for 5 mins *facepalm*
12957,"its Counterstrike 1.6 with a crappy zombie mode, pointless loadouts and crafting, and high pings!"
12958,"The game looked good and interesting so I downloaded it.I was horrified.

The homepage of the game is horrible.Everything from the UI/HUD and friends/chat/join game systems look ugly.It has some weird in-game currency,you earn it by playing.Also you can get other items as well.It looks like a poorly made system that tries to grab some cash from it's customers.

The graphics are the same as C.S 1.6 and I have a problem with this.You either release a new game or just stick to being a MOD.At least try to change something.It has some skins but they either look ugly or they could have been made better.Nexon added some new sounds but all of them are bad or just cringeworthy.

Absolutely everything is bad in this game.I cannot say one good thing about it...the gameplay is dull and there are a lot of very bad maps.The original MOD from C.S was way better than this.

I see this as a cash grab attempt with a ''pay to win'' or ''pay to enjoy'' system."
12959,pay to win =(
12960,"This is a terrible game, it feels and flows really badly."
12961,"All the people that rated this a negative clearly HAVE NOT played cs 1.6. 
This game is amazing and very addicting in my opinion."
12962,nice game ;)
12963,"This is terrible. Shop is over priced ($9.99 for pornish Soldier or pornish reporter!), performance is bad, menus are unusable.  Hits cause screen flash with no indication of direction.   This is half done and terrible.  

Don't waste your time and just play any Valve CS game, even 1.6.  I don't think this game would have been good even back in 1998, which is where it looks to have stolen its art and art direction from."
12964,"The game itself consists of several modes. All are mods that can be found on every version of counterstrike.

The only difference is that in this game you get to craft different weapons. And here's the kicker, you don't keep them. Yeah, you read that right.

Every gun you craft has a time limit of X amount of days based on what you used to craft it. After that it disappears from your inventory forever.

Those cool items you get for participating in events the devs throw? Gone in 15 days. That awesome gun you crafted? Gone in 1 day to 2 months. 

But hey, at least you can buy crafting items in the shop for real money. 

The actual gameplay is literally just stolen ideas from the mods people use in the real counterstrike game. Apart from the ""story mode"" where you literally just survive for 2 and a half minutes until the next wave. Repeat for 20 rounds, takes about a half hour. But if you want those cool event items that are going to disappear in two weeks then you have to do this on at least 10 maps. That's right, 20 rounds, a half hour each if you don't fail at all, on ten maps. That's assuming  the game isn't dead and there are actually people to play with, otherwise good luck.


Game is the definition of a scam, do not pay anything. Just go play the actual counterstrike mods. They're ten times better anyways."
12965,BEST GAME EVER+LVL
12966,"If you like microtransactions, the main menu always being in 1024x768, connection problems, a game that claims it is in the counter-strike series but is nothing like counter-strike, Nexon then this is the game for you!

Edit: I played about 15 minutes of this game and it says I haven't even played .1 hour in the review :P"
12967,Good for CS 1.6 lovers!
12968,Its a Free cs 1.6 :D
12969,Pretty bad!
12970,at least the uninstall option works
12971,Not realy sure what to think of this :P
12972,This game is just fucking awful.
12973,"Game isnt horrible persay (feels like a Counter-Strike game should sort of) but its got that Nexon Cashshop that makes something a little less enjoyible. Even though the amount of stuff to buy with real money is limited, It has the female models for real money and no other way (that i could find) to get them. When its something that is actually advertised as being in the game and doesnt say it requires money for especially since this is just Counter-Strike:Online with a different name. Still though, Gameplay is fun, If you want to deal with having teammates or enemys with 200-300 ping"
12974,"This game is totally copied cs 1.6. Korean bit*hes are too lazy to make a own game. And they fu*cked up the only two things that they had to do: G R A P H I C S and M E N U. Menu is totally 4:3 (of course not fullscreen), it looks like bad copy of CS: GO menu. First thing that you will notice is the worst Pay-To-Win system ever. Everything is Pay-To-Win. Weapons are, guess what? Only for a limited time. WTF? One pack of parts for weapons costs 1,99 ‚Ç¨. I do not know how many parts you will get if you will buy it because I turned this game off immediatly after I had find out this fu*cking system.  I have crafted one weapon (AK-47) and below the name of the weapon has been written: 27 days left. What? Okay lets move on the next thing. There is no singleplayer but bots are in the game implemented. WHY? I do not wanna go into details about menu. Menu summary: Bad, bad, bad and infinite times bad. Game is unplayable. My view is fixed to the right and i cannot do anything with it. I cannot write about it cause for me is the game unplayable. But I think it is same as menu. 

+It is a Game? (Not sure)
-P2W
-resolution 
-menu
-Korean game
-Copy of CS 1.6
-And thousand more reasons to hate this game

I hope this was useful for you :)
"
12975,"Want free cs 1.6?
Don't have any money?
This is the improvisation you need to play a game that's equal to CS and with stupid zombie modes that youre get sick of.
hurray now you can play f2p improvised cs"
12976,This game blows donkey balls then slaps said balls and eventually squeezes those balls.  Also add a steaming pile of zombie sh*t to make it that much better.  :'(   P2W
12977,Terrible its a mod and it feels like a bad mod. Nobody wants to play the old counterstrike. i'll never play this again
12978,"Has allot of bugs, you get stuck almost every 10 minutes ,.. allot more work to do untill you can relese a game .."
12979,Cs 1.6 with better guns and more rage quit
12980,"Basically this game is based on counter strike 1.6

But this one is a piece of shit

why, ZOMBIE

Zombie mode doesn't require users' playing

It needs good weapon and good place to attack zombies safely.

this game sucks

NEVER play this game

N.E.V.E.R"
12981,"I like zombie games, so i figured i give this one atry especially that it is free.
It is a Micropayments game which i am fine with but i had one giant problem with the game.
My problem was that it is unplayable ingame due something with the resolution, the way the resolution ingame looks is like it is meant to be played on an 80 inch. changing the resolution ingame didn't work at all. Did google search and found out that other people have the same problem but there is no solution for it.
I recommend try the game if you have the same resolution problem me and other people had. just uninstall it."
12982,Nice Game Come To Play
12983,"I installed this game hoping for a good CSS or CS 1.6 Zombies mod, instead I got a free-to-pay counter strike ripoff.  I am ashamed that this even caries the name ""Counter-Strike"" they changed Dust 2 SO MUCH that I couldn't even recognize it.  
  I now call all counter strike players, whether you're still playiong Source, curently in the new generation of Global Offensive, or a 1.6 purist, please please PLEASE work together to declare this game non-canon!"
12984,"This is a pay-to-play MMORPG hack-and-slash title. It has nothing to do with Counter-Strike and shares none of its design or gameplay. The only parts of Counter-Strike actually in this game are the model textures.

I actually encountered obvious bugs just attempting to set it up. The interface is so obtuse that I simply gave up trying to start a game.

Valve- I know that you're just distributing this game but the publisher needs a hint. This title was advertised in a misleading manner."
12985,bit meh
12986,"Cannot play on old computers ¬¥like you can with original counterstrike. The launcher/menu thing is very bloated and takes up unreasonable ammount of your computer recources also it always runs on the backround and makes the game itself lag, so dont expect it to play on your p4 w/1gb of ram.¬¥But if you have a modearate modern system it is not that big of a problem, the gameplay is fun and i havent seen any balancing issues yet."
12987,What a waste of 2.1 gb and 20 minutes of my life.
12988,"If you like CS, you'll like this."
12989,meh
12990,"Besides it being so full of bugs, i.g., no servers show up, requiring me to choose a nick name when we Steam users already have one, and then finding out that it won't take ANY nickname because that appears to be one of the bugs so you can't even start the game until it lets you.  Then there's the interface, looks like someone from a Zoo scooped up all the different animal feces, dumped it in a bucket and called it a ""menu""?  Basically I don't get how Steam can refuse some games on ""Green Light"" but this piece of c__p gets lit?  Oh, it must be that Steam gets paid a percentage for every penny that is spent on this supposedly free game.  Oh, and I won't even tell you how awful the game play is if you ever get that far."
12991,Game is horrible play it for the lolz
12992,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA REALLY GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12993,"bad realy bad cant get in a game pice of shit
"
12994,"It is fun for about 4 minutes, then it gets sooo boring..."
12995,Shitty pay2win Counterstrike 1.6 copy.
12996,"All it is is CS1.6 reskinned, with some new models and guns, not fancy at all. The accuracy is too terrible, and the game doesn't feel like a CS game."
12997,"This game is ok, very hard"
12998,wtf this game is bad  like i see what yall going to but come on  every thing is off i cant hit nobdy with a gun dame i dont know if you can hit sombody with a stick  dame to everybody get csgo
12999,"It's CS1.6 with guns from COD, zombies, airstrikes, and voice acting from 15 year olds. I have lost faith in humanity because of this game. gg."
13000,"Meh, it's alright if you like Conditino Zero with a temporary weapon crafting system as well as a mod that you could already play in the other CS games. Give this one a go if you're bored and just want to mess around with a stupid-fun kind of game. Other than that, just play the actual CS games."
13001,"As a competitive counter strike player this game just felt awkward even on a great gaming monitor it still felt sluggish.

Pros : 

Not a bad free to play game
classic maps 
can easily hold multiple people (32+) 
Original Game modes (even the zombies mod that css had) 

cons : 

Guns have a lot of spray (even when crouching) 
Mediocre graphics (will run on any modern day pc) (Not bad for a free to play game) 
Basically a free version of CSS with low res graphics 

=

I'd recommend this to an average player, but I would not recommend this to a F2P competitive gamer. 
I like the idea of it being low res graphics so that everyone will be able to play it but I believe even cs 1.6 will be able to run on most machines these days (and 1.6 was honestly better than this) would I play it again? No. But its a great free to play game if you're on a budget."
13002,qka w
13003,"''Pretty much cs 1.6 free to play''
it is not all about zombies, you can play bomb scenario missions with cs 1.6 weapons and maps for free. 
i recomend this to everyone!!!"
13004,free cs 1.6
13005,10/10 if valve are getting involved in zombies that means HALF LIFE 3 confirmed
13006,"OMG!. this game xD another good game from nexon,
ofc it's not the best graphic, and it's a copy of the old cs, but whatever you saying?. do hate it, it's f2p.
though i like it. never had so much fun before, team play zombie killing ;D f*ck the graphic, it is good

i've seen only bad revommend on this game, with ppl who only played 0.4 hours??? Daaammmmm.. do not comment it then?, i bet the guy below me is under 1 hour. 
but 10/10 - it's a f2p game with good gameplay, not the graphic.
"
13007,"Geez, look at all these negative reviews. Seriously guys, can we accept that this isn't CS for the competitive crowd? It's a free-to-play spinoff, for cripes sake. Ease off a little.

The game itself is one big guilty pleasure. I shouldn't be enjoying a free to play game - I shouldn't be enjoying the Skinner Box that is crafting - I shouldn't be enjoying overpowered weapons that have a time limit - and I most certainly shouldn't be enjoying CS turned into a rankfest, and yet... I am.

There's something undeniably charming about anime player models, ""enslaved"" zombies, and tacky weapon skins. Coupled with the fact this game has been in development since 2008 and has gotten a plethora of game modes since then, I'd say it's at least worth a shot."
13008,"Outdated CS 1.6 graphics and gameplay with a pay to win feature. Also, 100% lobby based, not an ""MMOFPS"". Not worth your time."
13009,Eg√©sz j√≥ :D
13010,If you like zombies then this is game for you. If you like killing zombies this is game for you. If you like killing floor then this is game for you. Wanna play only CS and for free? There you go :) I recommend this game.
13011,Bullshit game
13012,buggy crap....you get what you pay for
13013,just [u] Uninstall [/u] it
13014,"This game .... oh well from my brief expiriense it is a joke, it have nice idea but implementation is sad story. It is F2P so try it out if you want to but dont expect mutch .
Have a nice try ^^"
13015,"Good game, I recommend."
13016,worst shit ever
13017,CSS with zombie mod from a million years ago and standard junk micro transactions.

13019,"I played for Just 10 mins and i hated it bad gameplay, Bad graphics and bad Everything if u do want a CS game dont get this game CS S has  Better Graphics than this thing and i would buy that than get this game so Everyone who is Reading this DO NOT GET THIS GAME!"
13020,"Instant Regret!

13021,No.
13022,"Such wow, Such fast, Such graphics"
13023,What the fuck is this piece of shit? Why would you even make this game and even include Zombies? holy fucking mother of god. I'm sorry but if you're playing this game you're all fucked in the fucking head. holy shit this game is just as shit as all their nexon games.
13024,"Joc interesant, dupa mine, doar are prea multe pe el... zic si eu, oricum ,LIKE"
13025,worst game i ever played xD
13026,"I have played CSS and CSGO and this is the shittiest game ever made, plzz don't waste your 2 gb of download on it. ty"
13027,kinda crap
13028,Its a game. It sure is one of those. The quality of said game is debatable.
13029,CS Condition Zero with zombie mods and cs online = bullshit happens.
13030,"Started up and expected the orginal feels of zombie escape. In short, its P2W Nexon shit that doesn't deserve a Counter Strike title. It turn the zombie mod into this F2P with cash shop and confusing crafting and 10 day rent a item or whatever.

You are better off playing CS 1.6 or Source Zombies."
13031,"As someone with a lot of Experience playing Nexon games, who spent one year in Maplestory, five years and over two grand in Mabinogi, several years and over fifteen-hundred dollars in Combat Arms, and beta-tested Vindictus before finally calling it quits with this company, I'd say this game may captivate your attention at first but it will swiftly get boring, unless you start shoveling money into it. Once you start pushing money into their games they are only fun as long as you keep throwing money at it. They are all severely pay-to-win and take heavy advantage of a mechanic like micro-transactions with virtual currency. 

CS Nexon: Zombies at first glance reminded me of zombie mod in Combat Arms just repackaged with the Counter Strike brand. I've only downloaded it to give out a warning that Nexon is immorally taking advantage of using addictive personalities to shovel money into their games. Don't spend a dime or you may be pulled into their trap, however, this game will lose its luster very swiftly. 

Thank you. -Barri"
13032,"How to play this game
1. Get a .44 magnum
2. Shoot yourself in the head"
13033,"A poor man's version of a very poorly booted mod on 1.6
I much rather prefer playing the left 4 dead 2 mod on CS 1.6 than recommend this game.  The L4D2 mod on 1.6 offers more diversity in terms of human abilities as well as the zombies (multiple classes for each with their own special abilities).
Still suffers the same problems as the other games, where victory on the human side is so incredibly difficult to obtain that exploiting is almost required for a victory (aka going off the map).

Just quick being cheap and buy Counter-Strike 1.6 and get more diversity in game play mods as well as better gameplay overall..."
13034,"Played 25 mins of it.

Joined a random zombie game. Was boring as hell.

In this zombie match, me and various ( about 9 other ) Counter Terrorists were constantly attacked by zombies and had to keep moving through streets. It sounds fun, but is awful. VERY awful.

For the whole experience, I had about 7 machine guns blazing in my ear as well as ""Fire in the hole"" going off every 2 seconds.

The gameplay was bad too. What happened was, we had to move through streets. But, every 20-30 seconds, we had to stop and clear a barricade. These barricades had about 30,000 health each. What you had to do was get about 8 people shooting down the barricade and the other 2 people shooting zombies.

The zombies were really easy to kill. They had low HP, and each time they attacked they dealt 1-2 damage to you. What's worse, is every few zombie kills, you would get a level. These levels seemed to increase your max HP pool by about 5 per level. While it sounds reasonable, it was easy. For the first 10 levels, it took 1 zombie kill per level. And so before you know it, at level 35ish I had 380 or so health and was practically unkillable. I'm not sure if it was just me, but health seemed to regenerate. And fast.

So for the whole experience, it was easy and boring. You shoot at walls 75% of the time and after each match, you become partially deaf for an hour unless you play without sound.

I understand I only played one gamemode, but I really couldn't be bothered playing more, and thought I might as well just share my experience here in review form.



NEXON:

What other people are saying, the game is another Pay to win game. I didn't get much of a look at the store, but I did play another nexon game quite a while ago called Combat Arms. This and Combat Arms have very similar looking stores.

In combat arms, I can't remember what item it was, but I remember paying about ¬£27 for a single item in the store.

That item lasted a week.

Bloody Nexon...

( Yes, that was a while ago, I'm now not stupid enough to spend that much on any single item that has a duration )"
13035,Really really stupid game....
13036,"Uninstall button is even more fun than this game.
How do this kind of litter appear on steam?"
13037,"As much as i love Counter-Strike, i don't recommend this game. Over 3000 hours i have played Counter-Strike from version 1.3, but i quit this one after 30 minutes.

All the old maps and models have been used, only the gameplay is so much worse. The first thing you notice is that everything feels so slow compared to the other CS's, also your character feels like he's riding skates. When you tap the move buttons and release them, you glide a bit further, just like you're on ice, while you're playing de_dust2, nice and sandy.

A shop has also been added with micro-transactions to buy guns... pay-to-win, that is also a fucking fail. This is a FREE GAME, but i don't even recommend installing this. This is a waste of your time. Go buy 1.6, Condition Zero, Source or Global Offensive for a couple of bucks. But please, DON'T PLAY THIS GARBAGE. 0/10"
13038,This game is absolute rubbish
13039,"This game isn't worth playing. It has buggy controls and isn't very stable which result in a bad gaming experience. The graphics are not a big problem, but it is worse then the pictures shown on the store page of this game. Not really recommended for playing."
13040,Good for unistall :D
13041,"To be honest, i've played another nexon game called Combat arms that you might know. And i for like 600 hours maybe. And go play Combat arms than this game if you want some free zombie arena or pvp game. This game is working on source (i think, i didnt played that much on this engine so sry if i did a mistake) but its horrible and even the combat arms engine is looking better. You have more weapon choices and since the weapon buy system is almost the same, by time of use etc, you realy should play Combat arms wich is more complete and will stay more complete then this game."
13042,Wtf am i playing? complete garbage. i can see why it's free to play but even then i recommend NO ONE to get this. the mod was beautiful when it came out so how could it f*** up this bad?seriously though. fix up :/
13043,This game is so glitchy and bad that I couldn't even play it.
13044,this game is just zombie poop
13045,"Wanna play cs 1.6 free and whitout cheaters?
Then just download this game and enjoy!"
13046,"have not had the chance to play it pulls up the game and stopes 
 i have dl it 3 times and now still very =-("
13047,"One of the worst things I've ever played, ever."
13048,"This game is no better than the cheezy zombie mods freely available on 1.6 & CSS servers. Save your hard drive space and don't bother downloading this game.  There is absolutely no balancing in this game, I played on a Dust map and it's impossible to win as humans. The zombies have extremely high HP and respawn. One stab and you're a zombie just like the free mods but with even worse balancing.

This company is only out to make a quick buck out of you with microstransactions. Don't fall for it."
13049,"BASE GAMEMODE REVIEW (non zombie stuff)
I'd say 2 hours is more than enough to say this: Don't waste the bandwidth. I've asked many people why they were appealed to install this and they all said ""Because its free."" Although thats a plus I have seen little more reasons to play this other than about two more. Those being the level systems and the neat guns it has when you have the ability to craft them. But like almost every other F2P model out there, they are limited access and most have advantages over the stock items. The game is pretty much Combat Arms (another of nexons f2p titles plauged with microtransactions) and 1.6 reskinned.

Zombie stuff
The zombie mode plays similar to the zombie run gamemodes on source games, its fun with friends and to pass time, but the maps are boring after a while. The mode does offer some variations of zombies but that is affected by the F2P microtransaction system too."
13050,"This game is so bad, the idea is quite OK, but the fact that u cant even fix with rates makes the gameplay laggy and the bullets does not end up where they should.

It seems the Nexon company just threw this game togeather to milk you on money, since there is items/classes you can buy. (to get better than other players)

They havent even tried to make this game playable, this game is a flop, DO NOT PLAY OR SUPPORT THIS CRAP!

if you like this game, im sorry, you are dumb."
13051,"I played one match for around 7 minutes. As per usual with any game originating from a company in asian there is no Australian servers, and in this case there isn't even Oceanic. So to my fellow Australians, have fun getting hit from a map away with you 400 ping delay

Nexon has taken a mod that was just a bit of fun on CS, and made their own version of it with a pay to win scheme, and all the problems the original mod had. Which was basically that on some maps vent or crawlspace camping saw the humans dominate and on others it's impossible for the humans to win. 

I do not recommend this game to anyone. I instead recommend you fire up CSS, CSGO and just find a community server with the zombie mod installed."

THIS FRIKKIN AWESOME ZOMBIE GAME

Better than COD zombies

also it runs on the old Gold source engine, which is fine, doesnt effect gameplay, except bring a feeling of nostalgia"
13053,"The game launched in 640x480 windowed 4:3 resolution then it told me to pay now for a Katana.

10/10 Like Conter Strike with turbo cancer - IGN"
13054,nice :D
13055,"This game is good, reminds me of the haydays of 1.6. BUT if you are in Australia, just install 1.6 and try to find an aussie server cos it can be seen that the game isnt for us, as the ping is just rediculous."
13056,"The is a great game.

I like the graphics because they have a classic look. The zombie modes are a bit to easy if you have the right gun but it's still fun.
I dont think its a good game for hardcore gamers but its always fun to play whit a friend.
"
13057,"Played the non-steam version back in 2012, pwned all the pay-to-win scrubs with ""free"" guns, 10/10 would humiliate again."
13058,"This game. Let me start off by saying I have never reviewed a game before but feel I should in this case.  I was suspicious as soon as I read all the negative reviews but thought hey I'll give it a shot. I like CS, I like Zombies, I should like this too. What this game boils down to after playing a couple matches it bascally this. Spawn in with the Negev (or equivalent machine gun), completely ignore all other weapons and I mean ALL, SMGs, Shotguns, other pistols, useless. Then proceed to midlessly hold left left click and sway the mouse from side to side. Solved. Either that or get completely overun by the insane amounts of idential zombies. Thats it. It is a very boring, repeditive game and thats all is all. I fell that maybe if this game has more modern elements (graphics, gore system, decent models etc) this game could be more fun but as is the game runs off a decade old system (CS:CZ) and it really shows. I know its free and all but it seriouslly doesn't even warrent the Download space to get it.

TL;DR Not a big download and its free but it really isnt worth your time."
13059,"I played it for two hours and I had fun and I didn't have to spend any money; maybe it will stop being fun without spending money in the future for me in which case I'll stop playing it, but so far it was worth the download."
13060,It's bad.
13061,"The review below I did not write, however my profile says that I have. This is not a game I would recommend in the slightest.



The hoard survival is soo good, very intense. So many Zombies, so little ammo, so much KILLING!
The other game modes are quite good as well, team death match being an old classic that you just can't beat,
along with that the new infection game mode leaves the hair on your neck on edge.

Very good game and I would recommend this game to any one that has played a first person shooter, and to any ine starting!"
13062,"trash idk what valve was thinking of letting them use the game, like microtransactions to get shit when u could just BUY the oringal game play the same thing with all zombies, might not be same weapons but theres zombies mobs for cs 1.6 this game shouldnt exist its so bad 0/10"
13063,"Awful awful game. As it is, you'll get some hours out of it but then you'll get sick and tired of the long matches. I've only really played the PvE parts, some fun but it drags on like I said and very little reward. The game has lots of potential, but needs shorter matches and lots of balancing fixes. Doing missions solo is no different than having ten other players with you, all same difficulty. So, I'm partial with this review, it's worth playing for a little bit until you've had your share of fun with it."
13064,"There is nothing that needs to be said to explain why this game is so bad.
Play it for 30minutes and you will understand.

Uninstall it then go play 1.6.

2/10

......the only good thing i can think to say is that some of the weapons are cool and give CS a bit of a refresh BUT the rest of the game cancels this out. /uninstalling."
13065,"couldnt find a word for how shitty it is.. only words i found were steaming, pile, goat, shit and schoolbus."
13066,"Pretty fun.

Yes its kinda just like counter strike 1.6 and just a zombie mod added in but i found it very enjoyable to play :)"
13067,really wanted to play this game but uno no aussie server FML not play this at 300 ping
13068,This game is terrible. Don't waiste your time.
13069,This game is trash
13070,"A surprisngly fun Free to play version of Counter strike 1.6. Buy to win is surprisingly absent from most of the game, the things you can buy are limited to characters and basically loot boxes that you can just get in game with no problem. There's both PVP and PVE modes, including a ""classic"" mode that is basically 1.6 for free."
13071,Biggest POS game I have ever played.
13072,"I don't enjoy shooting walls for an hour.
"
13073,Bad. Just bad.
13074,"wurst game of wurst games ever, dont download."
13075,"Im tired of zombie games, and wish if CS was going to lower its standards to a zombie port to at least make it somewhat balanced. The zombies are super hard and the weapons for the humans are super weak in most modes. Not really my cup of tea, but then again i played CS when it was in beta so....."
13076,"Looked really cool. Loved the use of the original Source (Gold) engine.

However, Zombies are way too fucking easy to play and it's way too easy to lose as human. Not fun, unfortunately."
13077,GG
13078,"I was expecting good old zombie mode from 1.6 with this game, but better. Hoping that I can get those good memories back and have some fun.

Turns out that this is worse in every way you can imagine, sadly. Plus F2P pay to win stuff... that's bonus. (Oh, I forgot windowed menu that has placement messed up)

Oh and don't judge me because of only 0.2 hours. 
First experience was on original server where even 1.6 memories were ruined by blurry textures.
Second was on zombie server where tons of CTs shot at us, we were lagging around by movement and had same sound over and over again ""ZOMBIES WILL RETURN"", ""ZOMBIES WILL COME BACK"". 

Yeah, no thanks  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
13079,"I can say that, there's no point in nit getting this game! It's free and FUN AS HELL! In other words, if you don't have it, get it!"
13080,Bye
13081,"Its more addictive than CS:GO :O
"
13082,"Game sucks, zombie always win. you have to shoot a zombie like a million times before they die. But by then your get killed by a different zombie. waste of time."
13083,it is fun really is fun i enjoy it but hey i am a ODD person!
13084,Just give us OG Counter-Strike; not this.
13085,This game is TERRIBLE. The graphics look like the original Doom. The collision is horrific. I can't express with words how bad the collision is. Gameplay is nothing close to as amazing as CS:GO.
13086,mfw whole team gets turned into zombies http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/no-2.gif 11/10
13087,Feels like a shit iphone game but give it a try its playable but graphics and sound is terrible i give it a 4/10
13088,worst game ever. good job south korea. jk. you still suck.
13089,"Pros:
1. Its Free To Play and NOT PAY TO WIN
2. it's 1.6 with additional weapons, gamemodes, and soccer
3. there is soccer
4. im serious, there is soccer
5. Its fun to play with all of your friends
6. animations, models, and textures look great for the GOLDSAUCE (GoldSrc) engine
7. I played it for more than ten minutes

Cons:
1. I probably wont play normal CS 1.6 ever again :(

Conclusion:

""1000/10...it's okay"" - IGN"
13090,"WTF is that game ???? Worst use of 2.1 Gb ever !
Shitty graphics, horrible gameplay...waste of time !"
13091,i would rather be stuck out side if it was raining nokia 3310s that were falling from 2 km up. also its not really a mmo if you think about it. if this is cosidered a mmo so is every call of duty and the gta's. jumping in to games with random people is not really an mmo but what ever not like the gamers know everything. btw the nokia 3310 also has better graphics. but if you are looking for arcade shooter with multiplayer aspects this is for you.
13092,"The game is alright but it isn't perfect. I find it great that graphics are low end that way my friend and I can run it. The fact that the game hasn't showed any pay to win items yet, plus it's comepletely free to play. You get all original skins and guns for free. The gamemodes are alright, nothing really new. For me the only gamemode i find really fun and worth playing for a while is zombie escape.  Basically in that mode you have to run like hell to the safe zone from the zombies. I totally would recommend this to anybody and I think it's probably worth checking out especially if you want to play a CS game and can't afford or can't buy steam money.  6.5/10"
13093,i cant even load the game it just shows activating anti cheat mode and now i cant even watch porn
13094,CRAP WASTE OF TIME AND A P2W!!!!!!!
13095,By far the worse game i have ever played. I would rather chop off my own testicles with a dull spoon than play this ever again.
13096,I love that it brings the game back to the other counter strike's and plus it take a long time after you get in a server too. finally a good old game. graphics are good enough
13097," Let's have old graphics! Let's have a p2w system! Let's have bugs and glitches everywhere! Let's have terribly textured maps! Let's have resolutions that don't fix the screen! Let's still have a menu system before launching the actual game. Finally, let's plaster the Counter Strike name on a game, when it is barely like Counter Strike. This is a disgrace.

13107,This trainwreck of half assed dogshit thrown together is an insult to the CS name.
13108,Every time i try to play it I join a server and when it's loading the game crashes.
13109,"          Why the fuck are the zombies so OP in Zombie Hero. its 1 hit kill for them and they get over 3000 hp with 1000 armor. the humans get 1000 hp but what good is it. its still 1 hit to kill them even when you buy armor. Guns are literally just there to push them back so you can run away. it takes an entire fucking team to kill 1 zombie after they literally unload hundreds of rounds into the zombie. what the fuck is the point of that. my steam profile pic may make it seem im a happy camper with this. but deep down im so pissed off with it. Zombie Escape would be so much better if there was a larger amount of people playing and you can actually KILL the zombie. You dont feel like a unit when playing. you just run and hide then when a zombie finds you you pray more dont show up knowing theres NOTHING you can do to kill it unless you had 10 other people to shoot it. Plus that fucking zombie announcer ""the zombies will be ba-the zombies will be ba-the zombies will be back."" this stupid asshole wont shut his damn mouth. PLus there needs to be some better maps. The Zombie A.I. are special, and I dont mean the high honors special. I mean short bus special. Theyll bunch up in corners and get stuck alot. However they still do pose a threat because of their large numbers
           There are some good things with this free to play. it has a lot of potential. Zombie Scenario is a fun mode, Zombie Shelter is probably good if you have an actual team to talk to. I had a teammate in that mode and all he did was die and say ""im in position."" The reward system is cool along with this crafting thing ive been lookin at. My verdict is 4/10. What the fuck! I want to love this game but i fucking cant. fix Hero, thats probably the best mode and it sucks as of rn. I wouldn't recommend this until some serious updates come out. Which im sure will"
13110,"Uh its 1.6 + Skins + stuff - servers

Yea, the only downside is that its Peer hosting... like most asian games are... but its 1.6... if I have to say more... you probably don't know what 2 numbers are"
13111,For the time being i dont like this game. I cant go through a single round because the game keeps crashing. The game is fine until it crashes. Im stuck on lvl 1

13114,"WOW i hated this game!  using a machine gun i dumped 2 full clips into a zombie at close range, nothing happened.  it ran up and smacked me and turned me into a zombie.  i quit.  maybe i was missing something but it definitely did not appeal to me, as a human i started with 1000 health, as a zombie i had 1400+ which seemed pretty strange to me."

YOU have to pay ME to play this God awful game."
13121,"Holy friggin crap. Wasted an hour shooting walls and a boss. (quite literally.) The mision involved shooting barriers with enough rounds to kill a whole country. There were 3 of those things. Then then boss was the biggest bullet sponge ever. This game is only good if you are a masochist who wants to have bragging rights for playing 10 games straight. It almost makes me hate Valve enough to not use Steam anymore. It is that bad. This monotony is like if COD did 10 tons of every drug it is so dumb. OH MY FRIGGIN GOODNESS!!! SOMEONE FRIGGIN KILL ME!!!!!!! 

Long story short it is not even worth the bandwidth to try this steaming pile of shiz. VALVE REMOVE THIS CRAP!!! THIS IS HURTING YOUR IMAGE!!!

Well, it's the most amazing, heart warming, life changing game based on a true story.
My whole perspective of shooters, games and even life itself changed in one moment.
As I was installing the game, my need for the game only grew and grew. Once it finished, I bursted with joy, for I was expecting an orgasmic amount of fun. But what I got was so much more. Tears of joys came down my cheeks when thoughs four, glorious words appeared.
""This game requires Steam.""

I opened it dozens of times again to experience it again. Never have I played such an amazing gaming.
I give it 420 pts on the Rektascale and highly recommend it to people who want to live."

You can choose to play the original CT vs T game or Zombie Defense through the lobby.
It got boring pretty quick, I've already played my fair share of zombie mods in Counter Strike: Source that just replicates this.
It's still fun and I'd recommend people to give it a try, it is free after all.

If this doesn't let  you know about the P2W scheme behind Nexon.. I don't know what will. So... on to the gameplay. I'll admit I only played one mode, because of the special quest thing. Hero mode Italy. I played for about 45 mins, and am still 0/5 on that quest. Yet because of the sheer laggy gameplay and the evidence of unbalanced gameplay, I dont even wanna try any other modes. This is the saddest excuse for a game I have seen in a long time. I cannot even believe that Valve/Steam would allow this alongside the products they worked hard to make.. Do yourself a favor and pay the $5.00 for the original CS 1.6. It is this game, just actually a polished balanced game."

13136,"Rented gear and OP Zombies. 11/10 Would play again.

But seriously, the guns are rented....it's very unlikely you'll craft a permanent gun in this game. You have to buy the female players. (in 2014) The zombie mode is the most interesting part of the game but it's beyond unbalanced. They give the humans 1000 HP for no reason because zombies kill you with one hit and they're faster than you. If they were going for asymmetrical gameplay they failed miserably. The other zombie mode invovles shooting walls for 20 minutes while your teammates kill zombies that spawn out of the sky. (no joke) The achievements that come with this game are next to impossible and would require you dedicating your heart, mind, soul, will, emotions, and life to this game. Basically this game is a religion."

13142,"It's an alright game, but it gets old just sitting in one place waiting for the zombies to come and just fighting them in one specific area of the map.  Maybe the maps are just small?  When it comes to pvp, it's the typical run around and shoot the other team.  Same old stuff."

Me: WTF is this garbage? -420/50

*** EDIT ***

I am well aware I have over 150 hours on record (blame other games being on patch day).
My stance on the game has still not changed, but I'm in a much calmer place, at the time being, so I'll try giving it a less... ragey... review.

-MINUSES-
-The game is still very much p2w, as the best guns in the game are invariably purchasable for real money, or obtainable through the Death Star Torpedo shot that is the Decoder.

-The censorship is still there, and is just as noticable to those that can understand what they're saying, which I will get to later. The chat is annoyingly filled with astrixes, even for stupid phrases that only an over-protective mum or Chinese game would want or need.

-You still can't have a PROPER server, nor go to ANY server that isn't (in the scheme of things) run by Nexon. Seriously, I challenge you to find a PLAYER OR COMMUNITY HOSTED server. This has led to it being as though you were playing with bots, even with a full room.

-You cannot change your name without forking over a few bucks, you know, as if this were some sort of MMO. This also applies to clan tags (or tites, as they've been turned into).

-You will find the same exact 3-5 maps being repeated over, and over, and over.

-There's no way to filter languarges. This is especially problematic if you don't fluently speak Spanish in the American regional servers.

-Different player models have different stats, AGAIN giving an advantage to those wiling to fork money over (or who win the lottery-level luck of the Decoder).

-The twice-afore-mentioned Decoder CONSTANTLY plays the 'so-and-so player you have probobly no damned clue who is has just won <INSERT OVERPOWERED WEAPON / PLAYER MODEL HERE> message, which constantly interrupts the few times when someone manages to /actually/ start up a dialogue.

+PLUSSES+

+It's good to fill in the nostalgia, for a few hours.

+It provides the oppertunity to therapeutically punch zombies.

+It's a good time waster, when everything else you play is patching.

=That... really is all I can think about. Sorry guys. In the end, I wouldn't recommend this game, and I'm sorry about the saltiness in the O.P."
13169,"This game is completly mis-titled, rather than ""Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies"" its should be ""Counter-Strike Wall Shooting Simulator"" It's really a grind playing pve and pvp is just glorified counter-strike. its really not fun and incredibly laggy. 2/10 bad game.
but if you like shooting aimlessly and getting rewarded for it and doing it for an hour then 10/10 would recomend.

13181,"I would love to tell you what I think of this game, but it keeps crashing after 3 minutes of play"
13182,"ugly old and outdated. the gameplay is lacking, id rather pay 15$ on a private counter strike server for an HD skin

go play counter strike source for better zombies this is horrid and outdated i cant even set my resolution to 1366x768 very common size and on top of that after the horrid resolutions theres no graphics options whatsover"
13183,"Wanna get a good laugh for free?
Then this is worth a download.
But if you wanna play a serious zombie game just .. just dont.

Also: Supply BAWKS!!!!"
13184,do not download this is the most bs game that counter strike has done. there are holes in the maps if you buy ammo it gives you a useless weapon instead of ammo. there are too many things wrong here and on top of that ppl do nothing but hack. so the game is ruined for me thank for all the disapointment
13185,"I really don't see what's all the hate?

I mean just because it is free to play doesn't mean it is bad. Also it was made in korea! (CS Online) This game is only for them and was never intended to be released outside from korea, But now it is. 

so that's why some things dont really feel fit in game.But who cares!? You cant say a game is bad if you have not even put time in it to experience it properly of all the features it has to offer. Saying the game is ""bad"" and just by launching it and playing it for 5 mins.

Does not give you the full experience. So do your self a favour and if you want to play the game. At least play every mode available and try playing for a few hours to get the gist of the game. 

Pros:
Updated graphics
Fresh modes and fun gameplay
Weapons and Cosmetic
Nice friendly community 

Cons:
Limted engine (I would love to have CS Online 2)
Few noobies in game.
Can take a very long time to kill the bosses (Depending on how good your team mates are it may take a long time or a short time) 

Trust me. For playing this game for hours, It is very good and impressive!

4.5/5

13206,"Counter-Strike: Nexon Zombies is a strange one.

The game was first ""Remade"" from Condition Zero to the Korean gaming market under the title ""Counter-Strike: Online"", then it was backported to the western market as Counter-Strike: Nexon Zombies with multiple new gamemodes including the titular zombie fuzz.

So yeah, the game runs on the old GoldSrc engine which does admittedly look a bit cryptic by today's standards, but then again, that never stopped people from playing CS1.6 since it's still a popular title even after all these years and modern iterations of the series.

The game features 20 different game modes, new weapons and a whole bunch of new content including levels and crafting system. Everything that was in 1.6 is here as well, and more. So why are people hating it? Well, the presentation might be one thing, from the main menu to the game itself, it looks honestly pretty bad and unwelcoming. If i was a developer i'd try to fix that as soon as possible, since there is really not all that much wrong with the game itself.

Open Beta didn't have too much stuff in the in-game market so i cant really comment on the ""P2W"" factor people are referring to, but it doesn't honestly look too bad. I've seen much worse even on western games that i wont name here.

So, would i recommend you to play this game?

It depends, if you enjoyed playing CS1.6 back in the day like i did, then you'll probably find this a nostalgic trip that you'll most likely enjoy quite a bit. If you didn't, well, i guess you should give it a try regardless since it's free. Just dont be surprised if you find it a bit underwhelming on the graphics standpoint."

New score: 8.25

[b]Post-Beta Review (10/10/2014):[/b]
So after some more gameplay and experimenting with CSN:Z, I can proudly conclude that I would still recommend this game. After learning how to properly use crafted weapons and playing a couple new gamemodes, it made the game feel more complete and playable. Not too much has been changed from the beta, but there are minor tweaks, like the main menu going into windowed mode, which is kinda quirky, but works.

The gameplay still feels solid. The only times I felt cheated were when I was surrounded by zombies and there was nothing I could do. As I've stated in my old review, there are a plethora of different modes to play from, from the original Counter-Strike, to an Infection-like gamemode (which I covered earlier), to my favorite modes, the Scenarios. Zombie Scenarios pit you against a horde of zombies, and you have to destroy structures while staying alive. Human Scenarios throw you into an arena-like area, and there's a helicopter circling around, dropping troops on top of you. It can get pretty intense at times.

I can say that crafting is still pretty solid. I know a bit more about it than I did in the beta, and it's a very simple, yet interesting system. I hope I can experiment more once I get better items.

Overall, I still think CSN:Z is still a decent game. I would recommend you to give it a try. It is free, so there shouldn't be any harm, right?

My final score for this game is an 8.25/10.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b]OLD REVIEW (9/25/2014):[/b]

Although Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies has its quirks, it has some very enjoyable gamemodes, and an interesting crafting system as well. Due to the short time of the beta, I won't be able to review everything the game has to offer.

One of the most interesting gamemodes I saw was Zombie Scenario. Think of a Minecraft/Rust/7 Days to Die esque scenario where you have time in the day to gather resources and build a defense, but at night, hordes of Zombies try to attack your base. I really want to see how this mode will play out in the future.

There were other cool modes as well, such as Zombie Hero, which is the equivalent to Halo or CoD's Infection modes. You can also play the original CS modes as well, making this a free version of Counter-Strike.

The crafting system was fairly interesting as well. Instead of renting weapons *glares at Warface*, you obtain Graded Blueprints and Durables throughout gameplay. Blueprints are used in the creation of weapons. Durables determine how long you will have that weapon, sort of like it's durability, hence the name. There are 1 day durables, 3 day, 7 day, 24-30 day, and I even managed to have a 72-90 day! The blueprints are also ranked too, Grade 1, 2, 3, and so on. You can also combine Durables or Blueprints together to make higher quality items.

Unfortunately, there are a few issues with this game. The performance, for one, can be insanely low at times, due to how much gunfire and entities are active, making the game harder to play. I never experienced getting disconnected from the servers, however, like other people have reported.

Another issue is the bosses. These guys are f**king bullet sponges. Sure, I get the mission is to kill the boss, but is it necessary to take 25+ minutes to do so?

As I said before, this game has it's quirks, but overall? It's not a bad game. It has solid gameplay, and could keep you busy for quite some time.

My final rating for this game is a 7.75/10."
13213,"It reminds me of a mix between Gunz 2 itemization(<<I dislike this), and Left 4 Dead. With some counter-strike like maps and game modes. I wont lie I always have and always will dislike the idea of hourly or daily limited items. Gameplay of survival game mode I thought was unique because it got harder as the round progressed, and as the rounds progressed. Crafting I am sort of neutral on it depends on how it is setup. It mostly depends on if its going to be open market through steam. If it is going to consist meerly on how it is setup right now I dont like it. Graphics for a beta for what the game describes it to be, it is what it is a Free 2 play, with original counter strike play and feel.

Basically I think there are many things they can expand upon, and I think they are on a good start. I think if they progress the customization, the crafting, and have a open market through steam market. This game could become a good base for a mmofps. Maybe have a Item/skin involvement with CS-GO.

I am recommending this game not for what it is right now, but what I think it could turn into."
13214,It didn't take me long to uninstall this. I was expecting CSGO quality but got Atari 2600 quality. The game may have played well but the quality of the graphics were a killer for me. I would not recommend this.
13215,"This game is only in beta,and its awesome,dont listen those fag comments about it,it has great potential,and its secound day.I didnt have any problems with dc,servers,lags,...I recommend it to everyone."
13216,"People who think this game is extremely buggy and it doesn't give me that connection terminated error. It works really well on my computer and yes it does have it glitches but not like the ones people put in their reviews. I think the game is actually cool. I know people are going to be like this is the buggiest game ever made and its more like counter strike nexon: connection terminated and other crap they will say, but for me, this game is actually fun to play. And yes I will be playing this some. 
Pros: 
1. it works for me
2. it works for me
3. no connection terminated for me
4. runs well

Cons: 
1. Doesn't really feel like Counter Strike, but its still fun.
2. The resolution is a little off.
3. You can craft guns, but they only last about a day or a month, and you only have a limited amount of blueprints and craft items.

My rating for this game 8/10 Worth playing."

13222,I love this game :D
13223,"it just SUCKS.It supposed to be a zombie gamemode but if you run out of bullets(this will happen every 10 seconds even with 100 ammo in the clip)you will be insta killed, because the zombies have a 1 hit kill and they came from Need For Speed so you die pretty much instantly.The buy menu is just shit its uncontrollable it takes you 20 seconds to choose your loadout and then youre dead.Just forget this game like it never came out on steam.I didnt had to play too much to realise it dosent worth it"

13226,"I've been looking forward to this game for a while now I played it last night and it seemed exactley like the first Counter Strike just with a few more weapons and some improved textures but I was dissapointed this morning to find a pop up not letting the game launch but just say ""Hack Sensor."" To me that sounds a little mysterious not even having a button to click for help to even KNOW what that means. The game just got released so it probably has some flaws. This is going to be a good game after they fix it."
13227,This game is  just awful.
13228,"1/10
this game is terrible."
13229,"2021 NOTE:
As this for some reason became my most viewed review, i'd like to point out couple of things:
 - This review was made during beta of the game in 2014 and i have not played it since. Probably a lot has changed since then so i'd recommend checking more recent reviews.
- My english was far worse back then, so excuse my past self's bad english.
Aaaaaand, here's my original 2014 beta review:

If anyone ever played Zombie mode in any CS, they know what this is. In the game all players are humans. After few seconds one of you becomes Zombie. One hit = Become Zombie. Humans have to survive for few minutes and Zombies have to turn all humans into zombies. The game is acceptable as a Human, but as a Zombie you will have hard times. If group of humans shoots at you, there is nothing you can do - you can barely move, you cant shoot (maybe you can with different zombies but i was not able to do so) Unfortunately, most players feels to be heroic and just run around in open area. There are also alternative gamemodes for this, for example when one of humans becomes a ""Hero"" with special gun.

Other gamemode is zombie survival (or how its called), which sounds nice, but is actually pretty bad. All players play for half hour in same small area. Every wave many zombies spawn everywhere... and you literraly have to keep turning around to kill everything thats coming your way. If someone was spectating, they would think that you are dancing.

Zombie Scenario... or something like that... there are randomly chosen few random zombies to chase humans. They have to follow the signs and run. Sometimes they have to press something or shoot something. As a zombie you actually have to do the same... but instead of trying to escape - youre trying to hit them and turn them into zombies. I had slightly more fun playing this gamemode.

The highlight of this game is Zombie Shelter mode. You have shelter and you have to protect it. During day you have to gather resources around the map, look for black market to buy a weapons. During night there will be horde of zombies trying to destroy your shelter. With resources you can build turrets, walls and other buildings. To win, you have to kill two bosses.

There is lot of alternative gamemodes to these and there is also a ""Original"" and ""Basic"" gamemode. Thats just classic CS 1.6 with small changes.

Main Menu feels very uncomfortable. Craft menu contains pointless PIN code screen. If you try to end the game, game will try to convince you to keep playing with ""You havent finished your Special mission"" or ""You did not accepted your daily reward""... Even leaving the game before the end of match will result in loosing 100 points. I have no idea what are those points for.

+ Lot of gamemodes
+ Shelter Mode
+ New weapons
+ Players of older Zombie mods will love this

- Gameplay as Zombie
- Main Menu
- Some booring gamemodes

5/10
Im giving it a Thumb Up, because it is actually enjoyable game, once you find out how to play that. :)"
13230,Counter-Strike with zombies..........I LIKE IT!!!!! 3/5
13231,"Ok deci un cs cu modul original gratis, plus sistem de craft plus mod zombie plus fara servere codati sau admini retarzi. WELCOME TO HEAVEN!"
13232,most stupid game i ever play i didnt now its just counter strike online its completley shit
13233,Don't download very shit game. Save your time
13234,This Game is Suck... It is better to play the original 1.6. without shitty mod like this.
13235,what
13236,Very fun and free.
13237,"Everything Nexon touches dies. This is by far the worst rendition of a Counter Strike game that I have ever seen. If you want nostalgia, don't go with this, it's gonna be the worst disappointment."
13238,"I Dont see why there are so many negative comments this game is really fun to play a bunch of diffrent game modes and its not all zombies you can vs at classic counter strike or have a team vs ai bots. in the zombie modes its just like zombie panic source but with more like crafting, leveling up and a shop to buy gear.
this is a very fun free to play game 8.5/10."
13239,Gahh no.
13240,"Listened to a guy scream over his mic saying that he was getting raped by zombies which sounded like a robot.

13242,"Well i remember old ZM in 1.6 and it was much worse than this, so kidna not bad...4/10
"
13243,"Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is in my opinion, a terrible Counter Strike game. It is however an average Asian f2p shooter. I am not good at describing this one to you all, so I think I will do a pros and cons list below.

Pro> Free to play (ish)

Pro> Has Zombies

Pro> Everyone sucks equally bad for the most part...
------------------------------------------------------------------
Con> Connection Terminated

Con> Uses Counter Strike Name

Con> plays like a terribly bug filled version of classic Counter Strike

Con> Pay to win (maybe?) I haven't fully got a grasp on if this game is pay to win or not, its still a maybe for me


Really its up to you to play, I will eave this one at your discretion. It is times like these that I wish for a way to leave neutral reviews/ recommendations."

13245,"nagyon fasza :D
"
13246,"Now I know what your thinking, OMG its a horrible version of Counter-Strike 1.6, but actually its not bad at all. Sure there are swarms of bugs and issues, but its a Beta, so expect loads of improvments when the game becomes an Alfa."
13247,"The first idea of this game is: AWESOME; 2 very populair subjects, aka Counter Strike and zombies, in one game. The gameplay  of cs go with the zombies and opportunities of left4dead. This could be the best game al times. The screens and trailer looks amazing but now i gonna play it.

The graphics and maps is even WORST then gmod. Some maps are the same as cs and gmod but it's made like a nintendo95 game. The idea aka the point of the game is still a little bit strange of me but i figured out one mode and that is  be a terrorist or a Counter-terrorist but you work together... (little bit strange) and you need to kill the zombies what is really hard. But if you're a zambie you can bite the terrorist and then they became zombies; Great idea! But this beta is really really really low quality. If they can make it with the same graphics as cs go, but the same idea's who are already in this game, it's gonna be the best game ever. For now i don't say no, but i don't say yes either. It needs a lot of work and then it's gonna be GREAT! So i gonna say yes because its pretty fun to play but it can not compete with other games like cs go and L4D2!"
13248,All you are able to do is get in for 10 seconds then get thrown out.... let a lone you only got 3 days to play. Major fail for Nexon
13249,This game gave me diahrrea.
13250,"Actually... This is a pretty good game! Don't believe all the bad recommends for this game! Don't believe all the Nexon stuff is ****! Yah some modes suck really bad but the good ones Like Escape, Original and others are actually pretty good! I had great time with this game and friends yesterday and for sure I'll enjoy it again! So don't read all the bad recommends and try it yourselves!

8.5/10"
13251,"A bizarre, horrifying nightmare of nostalgia.

The worst thing is that some people think this is made by #ValveOfficial

There are so many things wrong with this game that don't make sense, it introduces problems never seen in CS 1.x to give you a demented experience that's a shadow of the game it blatantly rips off... and it has microtransactions. YES, CS with Micro-transactions

It always needs to run elevated, the first Steam game I've seen to do so, probably because it uses an exotic anti-cheat system that no one's heard of.
If you choose a name that's taken you'll get a connection terminated error that forces you to quit to the desktop. 
Because of this, I now have ""Steam"" has a nickname, there's no availability check and like other gimmicky F2P titles you need to pay to change your name... probably, I don't really know or care. ""Steam"" is a perfectly okay name with me for a game I'll never play.
The interface is locked to 1024x768, regardless of your specified in-game resolution. This doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is.
The console doesn't accept most commonly used GoldSrc commands, and looks like some horrid half-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• bespoke job that was never meant to be used.
North America and Oceania are considered the same region for the purposes of matchmaking.
250ms is considered ""Ideal"" ping.
I don't know if there are dedicated servers, but the game I just played had it's hoster switch and everyone dropped out. So, yeah, P2P CS.

Some of what I've just mentioned may be inaccurate, but whatever, I'm still giving this review more effort than the people who rolled out this rubbish."
13252,"I am  normally VERY LIENIENT when it  comes to  giving a game a fair shake..not this time.

This  is inexcusable. I'll admit  I  like  Counter strike  as I  have been  playing it since it's first iterations as a  modification for Half Life, and I  will  openly and  honestly admit with  no shame that it is  not for everyone and  the hardcore crowd is  kind of niche. and in some circles almost ""cultish"" in it's following.

So we  know it's not  ""sacred"" , just a well made mod that  grew organically into a  long standing well made  game series with  some  ""spotty""  moments on it's reputation..it was NEVER  perfect but..

With  all of this  said...THIS unspeakable  piece of crap is  how Nexon  chooses to  handle the C.S. series  built upon the backbone of the  most revered version of  counter strike we have what can  only be described as a cancerous growth ... a  tumor  both  hideous to behold as it is  devistating to  it's host.

Poor choices of modes,  poor Implementation  , no optimization  truncated menus and descriptions in said menus prove that Nexon  truly  does not care for the  consumer/playerbase.  Tacked on  thoughtless poorly balanced playmodes , patheticly coded poor  bots, unimaginative  zombie designs and gameplay better executed in  almost ANY  amatuer  mod of ill repute let alone one  that was crafted with  the skill and love that early  Counter Strike  mod revisions were.

6-7 flavors  of crappy  couldn't be @$$ed to  care ""zombie"" / infected modes, a  money grubbing cash  greedy  ""rent-2-PWN"" gun/gear shop crafting system  designed by a  five year old huffing glue, a few  cheap ""extreme""  font /U.I. changes that only make the whole experience come off as  cheaper than it really  ever was ( and note this is a ""FREE to play"" game so  cheaper than that is  pretty  deplorable.)  the best  maps in the game are the ones  that came from 1.6. but even they  didn't escape  being mangled  by fog and other pointless effects .

This is how Nexon treats a  well known staple of the E-sports scene and  much  liked  cornerstone of the FPS genre a classic..they  slash burn rip tear  mangle  and bloat the body  by exposing it  to only  Cthuhlu -knows-what.

and this unspeakably  mangled unholy mess of a shambling creature wearing  a tattered skin of the   classic  Counter Strike is  what they  have been  pushing off  onto China and South Korea...

I apologize China, South korea from the  bottom of my and many more  gamer's hearts, these sociopaths gave you a  poisoned pill  with a candy coating, they decived you and they  decived the ones who  saldy  lent them the rights to  license the Counter Strike series to your markets.

THIS is what is  killing  C.S. , this is what is killing gaming in  wide open markets that  are not  the US,Canada E.U. Japan Australia and  the other  ""entrenched"" markets.

and the real kick to the  junk  not all  foreign markets got   this  HORRIBLE   wannabe  CS 1.6 with  mods..Japan actually got a GOOD Altered version of Counter Strike : Source called CS: NEO put out by Namco of all companies in  2005... 

Take a moment and let that sink in..2005  Namco had  one year to take  CS :Source which  was not as ballanced at the  time as even C.S. 1.3. they did more  justice to this series almost 10 years ago to the the moment I  wrote this review than  Nexon  did  since  getting their  hands on  the license in  2008 with  tech  that's almot 14 years of  work careful work ballancing out  1.6 to  be what it is  ..still one of the most  wonderfully ballanced FPS titles to ever exist. 

It was never the best looking but it was one of the most studied, balanced and playable FPS  titles to this very day , and as of me writing this   a  pillar of  the  E-sports community  for it's execution.

All of that  hard work , all of that progress  was FORCEFULLY and willingly broken or  just  trown to the wayside like detritus by Nexon for a profit and it all culinated in this diasterpice  .

I  have  played CS:NEO it's  actually  unmistakably  , unabashedly a good game it's just a region specific reskinned and visually altered  ""vanilla"" CS : Source  with a  few minor add ons.

I would gladly  pay for that game even  with that with a  monetized gear / guns system hands  down over this with every last bit of pay pay content permanently  unlocked.
 I  would  still  gladly take CS:NEO  over this  mess even if  Nexon  paid me fairly to play this chunk of  awful intentions made manifest. 

This is not a game...this is a  mugging over TCPIP.

This is a blatent  cash grab using a well known name drop. this is  an affront and an insult to gamers EVERYWHERE."
13253,Very skippy. -10/10
13254,Terrible game
13255,"When you ask a Korean or a China man what Counter-Strike is, this is what they respond with."
13256,–ü–∏–∑–¥–∞–±–æ–ª—ã
13257,The Graphics are still need to be worked on. Its takes so long to kill zombies.
13258,:) wow god omg counter-strike nexon zombies
13259,"This game is terrible. i know its just it beta but come on guys is this even made by valve? The menu is confusing, getting onto servers is a drag and you can never get connected to one, you have missions thats you need people to play with. When i heared about this game i thought its gonna be like CSGO, but this is just a piss take of 1.6..."
13260,"This game is awful. You get to start with 1 gun, and it's a **** gun. Enjoy the grind fest."
13261,"I played this game for 12 minutes.
My laptop was fried from the immense torture of having to run such an awful game.

"
13262,"I currently have played 2 gamemodes, i have played Co-op Zombies, and i played the TDM (no zombies) , i have to say, i realy liked the fact that you were able to build turrets and upgrade your base. collect resources on the map durring the day, fight during the night (and have a scout out collecting resources for you since all the zombies try to destroy your base). Well, the Co-op was fun. but the Counterstrike gameplay (like TDM and Plant the bomb thingy :P) isnt as great as 1.6 or Source. So, i think this is a realy good game, it does not require a nexon account to play, and currently, it doesnt feel like a P2W at all, i hope it stays that way. :P worth trying to see if you like it.

EDIT: one of the major problems for the game is the HUGE lack of tutorial. AND THERE IS A FOOTBALL GAMEMODE, Its basicaly soccer, and its realy fun. bit glitchy though.
lots of people are going to like, lots are gonna hate, its up to you to try and see if you like it.

(im still sad that CSZ was made by nexon :p, went the beta ends, i hope we wont have a combat arms clone :/)"
13263,"If you want to play Counter-Strike with Zombies try out the Zombie Mod and/or Zombie Escape servers on Counter-Strike 1.6, Counter-Strike: Source, or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.  All of these blow Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies out of the water.  The difference in quality and fun is day and night.

Seriously Valve?  I can't even comprehend what I just played.  How could you let a third-party defile Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Zombie Mod so thoroughly?  I'm serious, this is very concerning."
13264,–∏–≥—Ä–∞ —Å—É–ø–µ—Ä
13265,"First off, This was originally a Korean Collab with Nexon and Steam so that people from Korea or Japan can have a taste of the greatness that is Counter-Strike. Now that we got that out of the way, let's get into the meat of the game - The Horde Mode.

1 team is the Survivors aka the Counter Terrorists while the other teams are the zombies. If you are thinking ""Alliance of Valiant Arms"" then yeah, it is a rehash of AvA's Zombie mode. Hell, Nexon used to have AvA!

Anyway, people can buy shit like Grenades, Hammers, that kind of thing OR they can throw over some cash to become an animu girl that's wearing little to nothing but pants and a black bra. Because Waifu Material.
Also, she can use a Triple Barrel Shotgun and double infinity pistols. Awesome.

Like all of the other reviews, this game has ALOT of bugs. It's a goddamn hybrid of AvA, L4D2, and CS 1.6, I am not going to get into the bugs of it because it would be kicking a dead horse (Connection Issues, Overlay, P2P*, etc)

Overall, this is just a Joke/Animu version of Counter Strike 1.6 from the Twisted minds of Nexon. And despite all of the fuck ups that this game has, i can still get a few laughs and fun times with this game. Get this game if you want to have something to laugh at while playing Counter Strike at the same time.**

Made in 2008 and Released on Steam in 2014, It's [strike] Counter Strike for Korea: Zombie Waifu Edition [/strike] Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies!
*This was ALSO in AvA, DFO, and Maplestory. Nexon sure loves it's P2P shops don't they?
**Seriously, It's halarious seeing a guy running away from another guy with a gigantic hammer."
13266,One of the worst games I've ever played 0/10 it's alright. There's literally no reason to play this at all. It's impossible to win as a human and its running off of a bastardized version of the CS 1.6 engine. DONT PLAY THIS PIECE OF SHIT
13267,HOW DO I GET A TUTORIAL?! I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS SHITTY GAME
13268,"This game requires Steam
This game requires Steam
This game requires Steam
This game requires Steam
This game requires Steam
Fuck you I will not open
Because
This game requires Steam
You obviously do not have it
This game requires Steam"
13269,Terrible
13270,WORST GAME  created like OMFG if you download this your a loser
13271,for everyone complaining it is still in [B] EARLY ACCESS [/B]! the game is so much fun.  i think it has alot of potential (:
13272,very cool game !
13273,"In all honesty. I wanted to give this game a fair shot because it was free. And most of the time despite the bad comments I enjoy the games a bit. But honestly this game is medicore at best. I know it's a standalone release of a CS1 mod. But it's too laggy. and the only bit of gameplay I did go through wasn't much fun.

If you're REAAALLY bored and don't have anything to play maybe this might be fun to you. But honestly there's so many better things to play than this.. haha."
13274,Pretty fun.
13275,"This was probably one of the worst games I've ever played, the zombies game mode makes no sense at all, the people you played with on the zombie game mode glow green and they kill you while using guns and all of a sudden you're a zombie."
13276,"this is a game that i feel mixed about, at first i love the idea of zombies in CS. but than my dreams were crashed when i saw the zombies take a shit ton of ammo to kill, if you make the zombies more easy to kill this game might make it, i would love to see it make it past bata but if the bugs, the zombies health, and the humans health to where you have a change. than yes, this game will become something way better than anyone could ever think. but my rate on it know is a 6 out 10"
13277,THE GAME WAS AWESOME! but i dindnt like the bugs
13278,"I think i am giving this game more effort with this review than the game developers gave it when making it. 
The resolotion is constantly stuck on 1280x1024 and cannot be increased past this.
The Server groups are North America and Oceania (One Server with ping of 250 seen as normal), Russia (CIS) Yeah they have a server for the former USSR but not for asia as general, and then europe (Russia not in Europe but Australia in NA?)
When i read Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies, i would have expected you know them to use the engine of counterstrike global offensive, or atleast Source because its 2014? How can they even justify using the old engine of CS 1.6 when they have a partnership with Valve?
The gameplay is laggy and dry, half the games do not even run on any sort of zombie mode and overall this game seems like an effortless pile put together by an unskilled modder.

Overall this game is a waste of the bandwith it takes to download it, anyone thinking about playing this for zombies is better off just playing zombie mod servers on CSS or CS:GO.

-A bunch off people will now give me FLAK saying its in beta and theyll fix everything but most of the things i listed (just a small piece of the cake of whats wrong with this game), are not excusable by beta or alpha or as this game feels a unfinished pre alpha build."
13279,"Dear Nexon,
  It is with great regret that I write to you on this day, September 24, 2014, to inform you that you can't mash Combat Arms with Counter Strike and Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies. I also regret to inform you that I was hoping for better gameplay, but the textrues are as important to you as golf is to teenagers - minus an except few. Now, I applaud your movement towards better gaming titles; however trying to make a Counter Strike knock-off game, isn't the greatest idea.

Sincerely,

13280,"In a nutshell: Another Counter Strike ripoff from Nexon, just with actual Counter Strike maps and models. Stick to Combat Arms if you're into that kind of thing. If not, stick to playing Garry's Mod Zombie servers."
13281,"Let us be reminded that its still in BETA. i actually like it. for me, it runs perfectly and i have no problems."
13282,"For a beta game, it's pretty enjoyable. I'm loving that valve decided to make a zombie mode for Counter Strike and am really excited for more from this game. I would rate it at 7/10 because of some of the bugs and glitches, but other than that, pretty fun game!"
13283,"Yes, it might not be a good old CS but has many game modes other than zombies even i like it."
13284,..........
13285,"Ok, this is horrible. It's not even half as good as some of the already present CounterStrike mods in the community. Plus, it runs on Source Gold. What. The Fuck. It's. Twenty. Four. Teen. I don't know the situation with Nexon, and I don't want to bother myself searching it up.

3/10"
13286,"Tried playing a Last Man Standing gamemode. Kinda like Infection from MW3. Every time someone dies it played a global sound of ""The Zombies will be back"" or another sound alerting  you that a player has been turned to the zombie side. It was way too annoying to play. I turned the sound as far as I could without it muting (using the in game slider) and the game was still too loud and overpowering other computer sounds such as TeamSpeak. The main menu is locked to 1024x768, even if you set the games res to 1920x1080. 

I thought I might enjoy this game because the idea of it sounds fun, but it is not really fun to play. I barely played it mainly because of the sound issue, but the game just isn't that fun. From what I had played, I do not like it."
13287,"Well, now that i have wasted an hour of my life playing this game to give a proper review, I will write my review.  PLEASE NOTE: This is a beta review, my complaints could change, but I don't see that happening since this is Nexon we are talking about.  Yes I am aware that this is in beta testing right now, but that is why I reviewing it, to help Nexon (if they choose to do so) fix their game.  ALSO NOTE:  I love Counter-Strike, all of them.  So this negative review is not based on my liking of CS.  Now, on to the review.


For starters, this game is Pay to Win up the booty, which is just not fine for any type of CS title, even if it is created by a different company.  Every weapon you get dissapears after so long, so have fun spending your time on a weapon that will last half as long.

Second is Sounds, and good lordy, are the sounds hilariously bad.  I actually had played this with my friend so I didn""t experience the pain by myself.  While we were playing, we first joined a lobby and were thrown into a cluster-duck of dumb, bland zombie moans, an announcer that sounds infected repeating ""the zombies will return"" and things similar to that, and a guy on the radio calling in a supply drop, but the guy calling it in sounded like he just had his testicles squished in between to hammers.  In the span of those 5 seconds, I was crying with laughter because of all of the insanity of sounds.

Now for the gameplay, which isn't much better.  Yes, there is a classic mode, which is just CTs against the Ts, but that can't even save this game from the endless and yet almost identical gametypes with zombies.  Just to kill a single zombie, (depending on what game type you are on, on some the zombies are litterally impossible to kill) it takes about 2 clips from an m4, which is way too much to kill a single zombie, as opposed to the zombies' one-hit kill with the secondary melee.  Not exactly fair.  As far as graphics, I don't ever honestly care about graphics, so long as they aren't painful to look at, but unfortunately, I found many textures that were just plain ugly and painful to look at in this game.  I love classic graphics, but there is a difference between classic and just plain bad.  Also, I guess I should mention that there are AI zombie modes, but its like a modded Killing Floor server that gives you too much money, and with really stupid zombie AI, and by ""stupid"" I mean walking into walls, walking past you, etc.

Wow, my fingers hurt, so I am going to say one more thing, if you like this game, goody for you.  I am not saying it is wrong for a person to like this game.  I mean, this is classic Counter-Strike with zombies!  But sadly, they did everything wrong with the concept of CS with zombies in my opinion.

My final verdict would be a 3/10, since it is free, and it is Counter-Strike, and I wish i could love this game like I wanted to,  but this was just not what I, or many others, wanted.  If Nexon could make this game more like-able, then someone please let me know when they do, I will gladly play this to change my review and update it if it is positively, dramaticly  changed, but this was just a huge let-down."
13288,"This game is basically the original Counter Strike, or Condition Zero, with a P2W monetization system thrown in just for the funzies. Although the screenshots for this game show it being played in 1920x1080p, but you don't have to worry, this isn't the case. 

Although you have the regular zombie mode, there is a TDM mode as well. It's somehow not as awful, but it's still bad.

0.01/10, wouldn't rate again."
13289,10/10 like skyrim with guns
13290,Very good game... I love it... Has potentional... and it can go far...
13291,"CS 1.6 with Mods, nothing new."

13297,"WORSTE ZOMBIE GAME I EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE! 
NOT WORTH THE TIME AND CANT EVEN GO FULL SCREEN!
.5/10 FOR AT LEAST TRYING!"
13298,"Within 8 minutes of playing this game, (including needing to restart it 3-4 times because it broke, connecting to a server and waiting until a round ended) I got a triple kill on actual other players, not zombies, players, and gave up.















































I've also heard it was a peice of crap from almost everyone that has played the game but I don't know personally."
13299,"Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is still in Beta testing and needs big improvements. It's just another cliche. Its basically a copy of other zombie games such as Left 4 Dead 2/Dead Island. A main aspect that needs working on are the graphics, maps, functions and creativity. The graphics are extremely similar to Counter-Strike Source and the maps are unoriginal. The functions of the game need to be change because humans need to get lots of headshot to kill a zombie and there are countless numbers of zombies running around everywhere that can infect humans within a single claw strike. When a claw strike attack is used it can infect about one metre infront. The zombies side is clearly overpowered. It takes about 10 people to continously headshot the zombie for 15 seconds with a machine gun to kill it. 
Overall, i think this game needs working on and is absolutly shit. Fortunately, its free to play. The servers have a shitload of lag and the response of the server is horrific. 

Rating: 5/10

13300,"Refuses to launch because ""This game requires Steam""
I'm uninstalling this junk."
13301,Literally the worst thing I have played in a long time.
13302,Kept crashing no good graphics
13303,Gets boring after two rounds
13304,Not a bad game from what i played but only played the escape mode where one person is the zombie the rest are survivors trying to escape the levels have some traps to slow him down lotta fun
13305,"Even with a low ping the game is incredibly laggy, to the point it's pretty much unplayable. There are MUCH better f2p games out there and sadly this one isn't very good. 

The positives:
- Nostagia for those of us who played the original CS when it was a mod for HL.
- Sprays.
- The original de_dust map.

The Cons:
- Laggy to the point of being unplayable.
- Terribly outdated engine and graphics.

Overall:
Better to just get CS:GO and avoid this. 1/10 and the 1 is for nostagia. This game should have been on the current CS engine, or even use the original source engine. To use the original HL engine is beyond ridiculous."
13306,"I got this on steam 


I couldnt play it and this is why i couldnt play it , and im not fucking kidding

This is what it said: 


This Game Requires Steam"
13307,"It's Counter-Strike Online rebranded. Wow! Thanks Nexon we already have 1.6 and zombie mod here.
However it's a great way to play Counter-Strike for free."
13308,this game is some retarded cs mmo made by asians or some shit
13309,"Run away, run faaaaarrrr away."
13310,this game is piece of garbage
13311,"Ummm...... this game was just....... How can you ejoy being the zombies they are just so terrible and the game it self is just....... the zombie cant even have fun because as soon as you get shot you get blown back, this game is just terrible and would not tell anyone about it. Sorry.
"
13312,It's amazing. It's  pretty much like Killing Zone but better.
13313,This game suck so much cock that it is making a balck hole in the center of the world and it is killing all life on earth as you look at this stupid comment on counter strike cock zombies
13314,Nice weapons! New models! Bad Graphics. Although still a nice game.
13315,Not that bad :D
13316,"This game isn't bad at all, the gameplay is just like 1.6, a bit buggy but it's still playable and actually enjoyable.
The added guns fit right in to the counter-strike play style. The added zombie modes might be buggy and one sided, but in a few updates and a few changes later it'll be quite enjoyable. People don't like new things at first, and if it's not perfect when they first play it they leave it and never pick it back up, and to them i say it's their loss. 

7/10 - IGN"
13317,"Effing awesome
nuff said"
13318,GOTY 2014! but in all seriousness this game is some good fun. but in some parts i can tell this was developed by an older asian man. take that how u will but the game has its rough edges. the final alien looking boss has almost 1.000.000 hit points of damage. it took 10 of us to take him out. good fun but it could have been alot better plus the resolution is weird to figue out for my flat screen it didnt have 1280 x 768. but its fun no doubt.
13319,It was EUGH. But not a bad EUGH. A good EUGH. Fun times for the whole EUGH.
13320,SHISHISIHSIHIHSIHISHISHIHSIHSIHSISHIHSIHISHIHSIHSt Game play now
13321,"For those whining. Don't play. It's free afterall, you're not losing anything. For those who played/still play the original Counter Strike you will love this game! It ahsn't just got a zombie mode, theres also modes like the original. It's a breeze or nostalgia with a fresh twist! 10/10 from me."
13322,Just the same as every other awful f2p fps out there. Garbage. Not worth anyones time.
13323,Good old classic cs zombies
13324,"Look, this is a FREE game that just launched into open beta. If one of the first free CS games has traphic/connection problems on the first day, that should've been expected. Overall I thought was pretty good, even though I haven't played that much of it. Because nexon is not valve, I can understand ccompletely that its not on the source engine."
13325,"Dont listen to all the reviews saying this game is terrible. it has all the greatness of cs 1.6 but with extra weapons, modes, and features that make this as must have for counter strike fans. ive never been disconnected or had any problems that other people had. Its a great, fun game give it a shot."
13326,"DID NOT WORK AT ALL ON MY COMPUTER, KEPT LAGGING, WOULD CONSTANTLY KEEP CLOSING BECAUSE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO HACK SPEED WAS RUNNING WHICH IS WHAT IT KEPT SAYING WHEN IT KICKED ME OUT, IM GOING TO TRY REDOWNLOADING IT BUT RIGHT NOW I DONT RECCOMEND IT."
13327,"Really fun but glitchy. I'm sure it'll be fixed though. A solid ""Like Skyrim but with guns"" - IGN out of 10."
13328,"Bigger money whorers since scrooge mcduck.
Everything is paid for. Everything.
Want to restart the mission because you failed it?
That will be one token.
Want to respawn?
One token please.
Want to use a knife in this mode? Sorry man - The knife isn available in this mode.
Unless of course you pay for it.
Most things have an expiry date, Do yo want to buy a gun to use it for 3 days and have it disapear?
Well thats what will happen.

TL;DR - Filthy money whores that will bleed you dry for simples game mechanics.

The game is a good number upper to make your steam library bigger. Aside from thaat it is actually wortless."

13330,"I don't care about graphics, I don't car how slow this game can be, I only care about how it plays. Unlike others, I actually liked this game. The fact that you get to fight zombies is FUN!

9/10 ""It's 'aight"" -LunaR_'s reviews"
13331,jesus fuck it's so bad why
13332,"No other game have I uninstalled as fast as this... Didnt believe all the bad reviws and tried to give it a chance. This is a buggy CS 1.6 with cluttered interface, and crappy micromanagement additions. If you have ever played any version of CS, do not install this. They all are much better than this. If you havent played CS, do not install this - it will ruin your perception of an otherwise great FPS. In other words do NOT install this game."
13333,"Crashed a few times.. but the rewards they're giving us, the games, the zombies and the boss fight just leaves me playing this game for HOURS! I recommend this game to anyone who likes Counter Strike games such as myself now onto the game modes:

-Original Basically it's like 1.6 no zombies no nothing.. just normal gameplay
-Beast 2 teams have a generator and kill people and collect their gems and you can turn into a horrible monster I'll let you find out the rest..
-Zombie hero Basically a zombie host gets chosen and attacks the humans to infect them.. In humans a hero gets chosen and he's harder to kill basically and gets better guns
-Zombie Shelter Basically a big map and you have to collect supplies to build a base and defend against zombies or enemy players if you're playing PvP
-Zombie Escape Big map and zombies.. zombies are invincible and chase the humans the humans have to get to the safe area, if the zombies get there first then tough luck
-Soccer One of my personal favorites it's basically 1 or 2 balls and.. you know the rest

These are just a taste of what you're gonna face.. so download this game and find out what lies within."
13334,Szerintem eg√©sz j√≥ kis game !!! :)
13335,This game is not even a counterstrike game
13336,"This is essentially a poorly balanced zombie mod wrapped in a buggy interface, nothing more."
13337,"it is rely fun i had no login problems but some servers i cant go on beacause it talks about some steam thing
"
13338,"Have been playing 1.6 for over a 10 years now..
What can I say about this mod.
I like it. Adds new functions to 1.6 which is nice.
This is 1.6 which is more like CS GO.
Weird, but not bad. 
Will keep comming back. Untill cheaters will find this mod."
13339,"This is an amazing game, it may be in beta... but I approve this game. I think you all should give it a try!"
13340,You should only play this game if you suck eggs
13341,Good free way to play some original cs with bots
13342,"Tragic and tired, Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies looks like it was launched 2 generations to late.  Overall game design is poor & amature with little to no polish.  Not worth to even try."
13343,Shit with an extra helping of more shit
13344,The zombies are OP. only can kill with grenade.
13345,"Awesome Game.
Good things:Free2Play[not typical pay to win],Cool Weapons,three tips of zombies,old maps from CS 1.6,Boss Mode and crafting system.
Bad things:Max resulution is 1024x768 and the FPS is capped to 60."
13346,"Forget the zombies, i've been having a blast playing the ""original"" mode of 1.6."
13347,"Pretty good. Has all the original modes and maps. Also has many more modes like team deathmatch, deathmatch, zombie survival, zombie/human scenario and much more. All you guys saying this game is bad just because it has the word Nexon in it, the game is good so stfu, plz. Doesn't lag at all (for me and many others). Overall a great game. Also, it's still in BETA people! There's bound to be problems, you know."
13348,"This is more like CS 1.6, but with mode ..........."
13349,what the fuck
13350,"Pretty good FPS as it is a free to play game, the zombies are overpowered although that isnt really a bad thing, just means you have to find a way to keep your distance and work as a team"
13351,"One of the Best games i have ever had the chance to play
"
13352,"at first, i thought from the looks of the screenshots, this game was gonna be awesome. i was SO FUCKING WRONG. the zombie mode, had little fun in it. i only enjoyed the rush mode, cuz that is the only exciment you will get from this game. the crafting is to confusing, and hell, i coulda sworn that i was seeing CUSTOM WEAPONS ON A FUCKING NORMAL BOMB DEFUSAL GAME. other than that, this is just a HORRIBLE knock off of counter strike, and you better stay away."
13353,"Think CS 1.6 with all the based weapons nerfed and purchaseable skins and guns.

Oh and zombies...

purchaseble zombies...

CS:MSS
Counter strike, money spending simulator.

My advice? Stick to one game, if you're already playing CS;GO don't kill you're wallet by playing this...
Or if you decide to play for free... pretend this is a demo, cause people who'd paid money are going to be better than you, have more guns than you, and have more levels than you.

Oh yeah game lags like a car running on square wheels... no amount of micro transactions will fix that."
13354,"All i can say about this game is :
Its freaking 2014. WTH?"
13355,"its a good game and they did fix the login error .people have to understaind it was and opened BETA!! which so you can tell them whats wrong so they can fixs the bugs.But be sides that if your COUNTER-STRIKE fan then this is the  game for you. Zombie Mode is so fun its crazy talking on the mic an other game modes like them deathmatch,bomb,an more...How can you forget its F2P SO PEOPLE STOP BEING UNGRATEFUL:)"
13356,"One of the best games out there, advanced graphics, support for Workshop, competitive mo-

Wait, this isnt Counter-Strike Global Offensive."
13357,"Great game! Couldn't even get past the main menu because I am a speedhacker, apparently. Didn't know my latency could be classified as speed hacks."
13358,"PIECE OF SHIT! 0/10, just a Same Shit Different Day game, nothing much. Crappy, very old graphics, sound effects, CS 1.6 copy paste + zombie shit. So much for creativity."

13369,A game from 2014 in a Engine from 1998?
13370,I honestly don't see why this game recieves as much hate as it does. A large majority of the reviews complain about the hardtime they had trying to start up the game. It's probably just me but i connected after two tries and it worked fine for then on. The game's resolution wasn't as big as my monitor but that wasn't a major problem. You start out with all the default CS weapons and all the temporary ones were custom to this game. You don't pay for them either as you find crafting materials as you play. Other than that the game is CS 1.6 for free with an optional zombie mode on the side.
13371,"Tried this out... only the ""human campaign"". I definitely cannot recommend it.
Gameplay is smooth, but on the other hand, it seems pretty unbalanced and extremely difficult. Also, if you have to leave the game (it was after two rounds of boss fight, both of them lost, and then it was restarted by another player AGAIN), you won't get any rewards or EXP, only some penalty points. Not the way to keep players motivated."
13372,I LOVE IT
13373,Free might be too much for this game.
13374,"I guess....if you dont already have css or csgo. The thing with this game is its so poorly synced. Shots still hit you when the enemies body is long gone, Sometimes you see blood and do no damage, its just no as good as cs 1.6 unfortunately."
13375,"Never before, one of my favourite series has been disgraced so badly. Pay to win elements are present within the game, and the mechanical feel of CS has been removed, not to mention that it is basically just a CS:S ripoff, Suck a fucking dick Nexon"
13376,It's shit
13377,"Let's be honest about this bullshit

positive:
- good old fashioned cs 1.6 style and gameplay..

negative:
- super ugly UI
- shitload of lag in the 'rooms' a.k.a. 'servers' - hosted on perforated hard drives of some village gamers in eastern ukraine .. (no offense)
- game modes with 0 ballance
- tons of useles stuff (coins, creates, bonuses, bull***)
- optimized as much as I can roll my pc as a joint and smoke the s**t out of it ..
- super annoying sounds with the quality of the ones in michael bay's movie
- extremely user-unfriendly interface ..
- showing 'busy' on channel is retarded at least .. it means there are players in there the other channels are nearly empty spread across 20 rooms with 25 players, show a freaking progress bar or something ..


PS: All the negative comments out there are for a reason. This is terrible .."
13378,"i kinda liked zombies in combat arms even though it was overran with damned hackers, but this fucking thing is so broken, i have a 18.3 1920x1080 monitor and a 1/3 of the screen is cut off so i can do anything nexon....at least ca was somewhat ""user friendly"" and i feel the hack shield you put in here is the same as combat arms, BROKEN FIX IT!!"
13379,CANT PLAY IT!!!
13380,"Bad graphics, poor gameplay, no servers available...all in all not a very good experiance. Hopefully the final product will be better, but I'm not sure if I will sacrifice any more time on it."
13381,Main Menu is fixed at 640x480. It's not user friendly at all. Doesn't try to be unique or original or change it up. Just boring and lame. Not worth the download. It has a lot game modes but most of them are from the original Counter-Strike. I give credit for that but most of them were already in Counter-Strike so it's not unique or original at all. It tries to copy Counter-Strike original zombies but with bad Sven co-op elements. Not really good.
13382,"I loved the zombie mod(s) in CS 1.6 and CS:S including zombie escape maps but this game...this is seriously bad.
Not my game, you are free to give this game a chance, you might like it but I say it's a waste of time. It had potential, the idea has potential but not in this way."
13383,only played for a little bit. found that actual mods for csgo for zombies seem more fun but wont give a bad review just on that. they could have atleast used the source engine to make this game. 1.6 is fun and all but the engine is dated. with that said hope they are able to last.
13384,"As Nexon is completely known in the F2P world they have now come with a F2P 'Counter-Strike'
Okay you have the normal missions like Defuse on Dust_2... But then they also came with this 'Zombie' mode.
The zombies in the game are quite balanced and they can be killed quite fast. The only thing that I can't stand about the game is that the aiming function and the customisation into the crosshair just totally blows... Also because of Nexon you get these wierd guns that you can buy/grind and they will do more damage of have less recoil.. I think this game does not deserve the name 'Counter-Strike'. I didnt got any disconnection problems though. I will stick to CS:GO and possibly will play again in the future.

Edit:
If you are used to CS:GO/CS:S, don't even try to play this.
You can craft overpowered weapons that have more accurate,ammo,damage.
Rooms are full of hackers ALREADY! (and old 1.6 players)
Hit detection is also pretty crap and should be fixed.
Still no customisation for the crosshairs which is also crap.
Zombie mode is still in favour to the Zombies cause they have INSANE amount of health and you get not enough bullets to PewPew all of these zombies.
So my end conclusion to this Pay2Win (game)
SKIP IT > BUY CS:GO"
13385,"Bombarded with ""new items"" and ""News"" windows on startup. Every time... Even 5 minutes returning to the game, I get ""oh, check out this news that hasn't change since you last played"" 
Tiny 1024x768 max resolutions, UI is a mess, can't change any graphics settings... Using old graphics... Why not use source at least?
90% of the time, it doesn't remember my settings for audio/keybindings. just resets to default... 
First game I join; Crash, ""Fatal Error; Mod_loadBrushModel: models/player/militia/militia.mdl has wrong version number (0 should be 30)"" - right after installing the game. > checked Validation and got 18 files... 18 corrupt/broken/missing files (1.2Gig) only a few minutes after I just installed the game... 
Audio menu refers ""Background music"" as ""MP3 Volume"" (Possible to play your own music? Nope, doesn't look like it.)
Background animation/movie: laggy, annoying, distracting, unrelated: it's a Dragon, What?
Zombies look goofy, with the following names:  ""Normal zombie"" ""Light Zombie"" ""Heavy Zombie"" and ""Voodoo Zombie"" Cant decide if I should shoot or stand and laugh. (zombies are just bullet sponges anyways. Spend all your mags on a single zombie... Don't get why Nexon thinks that zombies somehow become gods immune to everything.)
Can't compare stats of weapons... have to manually click to see the numbers change one by one. so you end up saying Fck it and grab a machine gun.
>See item can be transferred > Click transfer > Get message saying you don't have a 'duffel bag', click ok to buy one from store > Click OK > No duffel bag in store. > Wtf...
Game made by Nexon, so you know it'll be filled with hackers and Pay2Win very soon.
Connection issues.
Sound; sounds like its been ripped right out of Combat arms; their /other/ dead game... It's just not good, and very annoying.

Waited for the game to validate, then redownload itself. still hardly working. Without even getting in a single game for more than 10 seconds.  Uninstalled it and moved on.

Avoid/10
Not even worth downloading to trick your little brother into thinking it's a good game.
"
13386,"Valve.....i am sooooo dissapointed in you guys. First off, why would you make a new cs game with the old cs engine and graphics why not csgo graphics. Second, why dont you have VAC anti cheat instead of the shitty nexon one. Third, nexon makes all there games pay to win and everybody knows that! This is by far, the worst game i have ever played and probley the only game i dont like from valve. DO NOT get this game!"
13387,"Worst game ever, CS 1.6 engine + cheap hud... kill 1500 bots in 2 mins, only for Korean glazki

800x600 res"
13388,What is this shit?
13389,"holy FUCK i never thought it would be THIS bad.

Somehow they took CS1.6, broke it, put it back together in a way that vaguely resembles the pre-broken product and released it.

13398,Horrible game. Just pay a few $ and buy the real CS 1.6
13399,"The best game I have ever played in twenty years of computer gaming, bar none (and I have played a LOT of games). Eight years on I can still recall how profoundly that game gripped me, and I am not an overly emotional person. You will care about the characters, you will be moved, you will make choices that tell you more about yourself. It sounds trite, I know, but it really is that good. If only someone would make more of these...insightful, intelligent, devastatingly creative. Fallout is the only RPG to come close. A word of warning: You MUST read all the text, explore all the dialogue options, if you are to gain the most from the game. A decent intelligence and wisdom score is recommended.....although so is a decent score in everything else....the game does the best job of making usually superflous statistics genuinely useful that I have ever seen. Still very much worth playing."
13400,"the game is really fun, alot of zombies to kill, alot of content, i play mostly the korean version but this version is fun to, my only gripe would have to be the horrible english voice acting. other than that ican kind of understand the hate for this game but you really have to calm down and go easy on the game and look at it from a gaming and content perspective and how fun the game is and what it offers."
13401,"Go google screenshots of a f2p game called wolf team, this game is THE SAME game as it except somebody has removed parts and changed it so it seems to be a counter strike themed game.

This game also instantly crashed the first time I ran it this is excusable because it's in supposed ""beta"" which is crap because the game is already been out for 6 years on another dev site... just under a different name with slightly different features..

this game throws new player bonuses at you as soon as you first start the exact same as wolf team did also 12000 points, sounds good? gets you a weapon or a different variation of zombie for a couple days, ALSO LIKE WOLF TEAM.

This is an identical copy of wolf team on a shit developer site called aeria games, this game is horrid, wolf team was as pay 2 win as pay 2 win games got and this is no different or if it isn't now it soon will be.

Its based on CS 1.6 engine. (which is HL1 engine, which came out in 1998)."

13408,Really terrible game. My experience was 10 people standing on a roof spamming hundreds of bullets at near invincible + 1 invincible (yes host zombie is invincible) zombies. There was literally nothing interesting about this game.

13413,"Cool. It's a direct copy of Counter-Strike: Online. I would call it just Counter-Strike Nexon. The Zombies is just a gamemode, along the classic ones. It's not making the game's base. So It's free CS for you guys, but i would like to see Counter-Strike: Online 2, instead of this... 

The game itself is not the same sadly. So there is nothing to do here, since it's marketized for koreans, and not for the west, anyway we have CS1.6 and CSGO and CSS  :D"
13414,Awesome game i like the zombie idea and i hope for more maps and cool stuff.

Where you have usual camping and escape (camping with running) maps.

Given it has problems, however the gameplay and modes do not dissapoint, it is only in oben beta at the moment but i guarentee that this game will improve. Personally I have played Counter Strike for almost half my life, seeing 1.6 is a good way to relax and have fun. This game has alot of unreleased content coming and has a viraity of modes, from zombies to PVP. In my opinion and based off of the games current state i would give it a 9/10(My opinion you do not have to agree)."

+ Gameplay is just like CS 1.6,
+ Hitreg is right on the spot,
+ Old-school Graphics ( I love good graphics like crisis or Farcry, but i can appreciate the old-school graphics too)
+ IT'S FREE!!!! 
- Some minor bugs, but i guess these will be fixed as time goes on.

Do i recommend this game? yes i do, it's the feel from the original CS 1.6, for FREE!!!!!!!!.

It's definitely worth trying, install the game and see for yourself.

13469,"Unplayable, doesn't work and extremely clunky. The menus are extremely annoying to navigate, changing in-game resolution doesn't do anything, searching for a game is tedious at best and the graphics are beyond dated. It's all user un-friendly. This doesn't even look like a Counter-Strike game and I know this because Counter-Strike games actually work!

Unacceptable, bog standard and uninstalled.

P.S The time it takes to launch, even when you put it on an SSD is absurd."

- Gameplay
- Random Zombie selection even if you buy some Expensive weapon with your Hard earn money
- If you are a zombie and a player shoots you, you can't move
- The menus are got renewed and not visible through
- Everyone spawns on a random location, sometimes the guy behind you will be the selected zombie and you get killed instantly
- The game is a chaos

I do not recommend to try it even."

The only good thing you could do is to DELETE LOCAL CONTENT!"
13485,"I am a huge fan of the counter-strike series but what the fuck did i just play?

It seems like the css zombie mod with more guns and extra stuff added like moral boosters and stuff. To start off the game seems to have ingame credit? and the menu system is just horrible and confusing. I would start by removing all of the cluter on the menu and then, yano, let me run it in a resolution that's not 1280x720. The game its self is just a reskin of CS 1.6 but my god. The amount of extra un-needed audio in this game is stupid. The entire round is just ""THE ZOMBIES WILL RETURN. THE ZOMBIES HAVE BEEN ENSLAVED. YOU HAVE BECOME A SLAVE TO THE ZOMBIES"" over and over again. Also i'm not a huge player of 1.6 but i cant remember ever moving so slowely in the game, please, correct me if im wrong but im certain it wasn't as slow as you are in this game.

The actual game is very much like the CSS zombies mod which i stated before but more annoying and the buy menu in the actual game is just confusing and took me a good few rounds to figure it out.

TLDR: Don't play it unless you like looking at ugly menus and love eharing the same 4 words repeated 50000 times in a round. Go play CSS zombie mod if you really want a counter strike zombie game."
13486,It's Counter vs Zombies :D good game but it needs a lot of work
13487,ok first at all : Its a free 2 play game. so it seems clearly for me that the game hasnt such a good graphic like csgo or battlefield 4 . but the idea of this game is grate !
13488,This game came out too late. If this was a decade ago I would've said hell yeah.
13489,"Counter Strike Nexon : Zombies (CSNZ)

CSNZ is an offshoot of the CS (Counter Strike) 1.6 version.
Playable on Steam.Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies takes on the gameplay of the classic 
tactical shooter, but introduces a number of new PvP and PvE game modes. 
As the title suggests, it is about a ""undead threat."" Besides terrorists and 
counter-terrorists, the 
various types of zombies romp on known maps such as ""de_dust"" also new scenarios.
There is also a crafting system, which allows to customize weapons and upgrades. 
There are new female and male characters.
And Nexon wants to provide ""ongoing new content"".

Who was spoiled by other shooter might have some problems with the graphics of CSNZ.
But we must not forget the CSNZ based on the classic CS version.And it's free to play.
A good engine like CryEngine/Unreal Engine 4/Unity/Havok Vision Engine cost money, if 
Nexon would have used this engine, 
the game would not be free and it would not be based on the classical CS version.

The zombie mode is quite nice. The control getting used to but CS fans 
may have no problems with it.The graphics, as mentioned earlier, is based on the classic CS version, 
and has been slightly revised.Graphic was ""rounded""- Edges ""smoothed"".
Compared to the classic version, it gives the whole a modern ""touch"".

This makes the game appealing.

You will find well-known maps and get the retro-feeling back.
A journey into a more modern Dust or Italy.

It is of course also possible to play normally without zombies, which makes the game more interesting.
Zombie or normal gameplay. 
For me the game is too slow and sluggish.But long-established CS lovers will love it.


It's a long time since I played CS1.6, but it was ""all"" taken over to CSNZ who 
played CS1.6 know here how to place purchases etc.

My conclusion, it is a welcome change.And it's fun to remember the old CS1.6 times.
This game has been well implemented.

The changes that were made on Maps, new game modes etc are also great realized.


Personally, I'll probably rarely or never play.

Because I can not and will not get used to this graphic, 
the gameplay is too slow and sluggish to me.

However, I think it is worth a try, everyone should have tested it once."
13490,"Thought this would have been a Left 4 Dead style zombie game with Left 4 Dead style PvP. But no, it's the god damn CS zombie mod that plagues 50% of all servers in the server list. Worthless. Nothing new.

Also, connection problems."
13491,"A bizarre, horrifying nightmare of nostalgia.

There are so many things wrong with this game that don't make sense, it introduces problems never seen in CS 1.x to give you a demented experience that's a shadow of the game it blatantly rips off.

[list]
[*] It always needs to run elevated, the first Steam game I've seen to do so, probably because it uses an exotic anti-cheat system that no one's heard of.
[*] If you choose a name that's taken you'll get a connection terminated error that forces you to quit to the desktop. 
[*] Because of this, I now have ""Steam"" has a nickname, there's no availability check and like other gimmicky F2P titles you need to pay to change your name... probably, I don't really know or care. ""Steam"" is a perfectly okay name with me for a game I'll never play.
[*] The interface is locked to 1024x768, regardless of your specified in-game resolution. This doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is.
[*] The console doesn't accept most commonly used GoldSrc commands, and looks like some horrid half-assed bespoke job that was never meant to be used.
[*] North America and Oceania are considered the same region for the purposes of matchmaking.
[*] 250ms is considered ""Ideal"" ping.
[*] I don't know if there are dedicated servers, but the game I just played had it's hoster switch and everyone dropped out. So, yeah, P2P CS.

"
13508,Do not play.
13509,"This game is complete and utter trash. Definitely not ready for launch. First was trying to load the game, which crashed at different points over and over again. After verifying my game cache integrity (three times, as the first and second time produced no results), I was finally able to get in. Once I got in, I proceeded to try to change my video settings to change my resolution, which requires you to manually restart the game to take effect, but guess what? the resolution never changes. This game is trash. Stay away and save yourself the headache of trying to get it to work."
13510,"A lot of people shit on this game for the connection issues. I was able to play just fine after they fixed it, and it is a lot better than i expected it to be. I had low expectations, but now i can see it is truly going to be a decent game. I mean, its free, you really have nothing to complain about. Here's a few things i like, and then ill do the pros and cons-

It has that ""P2W"" feel (guns lasting a few days) without actually using any real life currency. i personally like it. the crafting system determines how long the gun will last, and then you can upgrade the gun itself. its pretty creative, and iv'e never seen anything like it. The level design is fairly decent, maps tend to be pretty small besides the zombie co-op gamemode (forgive me, i forget the name of the gamemode) but overall, it feels like a counter strike game with a lot more variety.

PROS:
-Customize buy menu with countless guns
-upgrade your guns
-p2w feel without real life currency
-ZOMBIES
- plenty of AI and Non AI gamemodes
-decent clan system
-has that classic counter strike feel without it feeling like just a mod
-in-game leveling system (level up your speed, attack, ammo, etc) as well as overall leveling system (unlock and craft more/better guns)

CONS:
-took some time for servers to come up
-occasional server crash (only happened 1 time out of my total play time)
-takes some time to get used to crafting, upgrading, etc
-rounds can be LONG. I played ONE ROUND that lasted more than 2 hours (co-op)
-Penalties for quitting a round (when you shoot mindlessly at AI for over an hour without any progress, you get bored quickly)
-getting new guns is determined by chance
-overall pretty small maps (personal preference)
-some guns are OP
-takes a few tries to actually log in upon start up (give it a few tries if it doesnt work the first time)

Overall, i would reccommend this game to anyone who's a fan of Counter Strike, or even just survival horror games althogether. The replay value is very high, and seeing how this is a beta, that says a lot. It's worth a try, its relatively small (i believe around 2-4GB) and it doesn't take a supercomputer to run. it's a fun game in my opinion, and ill definitely be partaking when it has its full release. Hope this review helped!"
13511,"Needs some work but it looks like it ""could"" be a okay game...maybe. It is kinda of the same old same old shoot zombies but with a counter strike twist."
13512,So interesting!
13513,let me say one think its CS 1.6 on mods nothink less nothink more its free to play witch its good and its not Super Awesome but its good and I think that isnt bad I like the zombies but you can get that on CS 1.6 too so for some of you is waste of time but for some its good enough game to play. (sorry for my english its not best :) )
13514,"Other than the annoying new announcer for zombie transformations, Nexon Zombies makes for a fun change to counter strike, and to top it all off, its Free to Play!
Its great to finally have Counter Strike: Online on steam."
13515,Counter-Strike Nexon: Connection terminated. Please launch the game again.
13516,Its Goooood! Haters gona Hate
13517,needs some work but fun to play  free is always  good
13518,Well I thought it was great
13519,Don't play this ever..just dont..biggest waste of 2minutes of my life.
13520,"Played open beta and it was awesome!
It's been years since the game's release in Europe with the different title. The game's evolving into something more bigger with the new updates. I can't believe Nexon did it. I've been always waiting for Counter-Strike Online (Yep, that's how it's called in Asia) to come out in Europe! And so it did.
Thank you Nexon."
13521,"It's pretty good. Back in the days, i really enjoyed zombie mod on cs1.6. The problem was that you had to wait for a long ass time to download the map and the addons so you could finally join to the server, however, with this game there is no need for downloads! It's all in there. So give it a try if you haven't already.

8/10"
13522,"Now when I first played this earlier I've never experienced any connection issues while half of the nexon game community did. I have played the game with no issues and this is what I have to say. This game is in beta still and knowing that it has a lot of issues which is understandable I do believe this f2p is unbalanced. The only weapon you can survive with mostly is any LMG and grenades unless you play the hero and get that special rifle that kills zombies pretty quickly. Exploits all over and the zombies have a very high chance of winning every round because they can bottleneck your ass pretty easy.

It's still a great concept, but the actual CS mod still does a better job than this. I would not recommend this to everyone, but if you want to try then give it a try. I don't think this will be a game you play all the time though. Just stick with the original zombie mod for CS 1.6, CS:S, and CS:GO."
13523,"essentially this game is 1.6, i recommend other zombie games, HIGHLY recommend. id rather play zombie mods on source."
13524,Couldn't get over the poor client
13525,"hah. Game crashed after 3 rounds, when i had to respawn for the first time.

I wouldn't say the game is horrible. Its like a zombie mod for counterstrike. It takes the difficulty of installing a CS MOD out of the equation.

The zombies fall in from the sky. Sometimes the zombies dropped large items which you could pick up. I dont know what those items did. Probably something with crafting.

I was level 1, and gaining exp from... killing zombies I think."
13526,Have you ever wanted to know how to make 1.6 bad? Play this.
13527,Nope
13528,its just not good
13529,"Whats with nexons Fetish for item rentals on to my next rant,
This game isnt basically Combat arms it IS combat arms just a different name 
Also i need a damn gps and 5 page tutorial on how to find a match.
Do i recommend this? TOTALLY"
13530,The game is like classic CS BUT at the moment i do not reccomend...trust me its a good game but it is not stable to hold a connection.There is variety there is gamemodes just not the gameplay bc of internet connection and crashing i will give it a 6.5/10 WILL UPDATE ON THIS REVIEW
13531,the disapointment of the century
13532,"updated 10/30/2015
Still a fun game.  Yes graphics are not great, or even good BUT it is fun and enjoyable.  It is F2P and NOT P2W!
_________________________________________________________________________________

updated 10/13/2014
Still really fun now that it has been fully released.  Many new maps and drops.
Also the Devs are fixing bugs and updating every other day.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you like Combat Arms you will love this.
Pretty much all it is is an updated version of Combat Arms (minus the hackers). Defiantely fun!"
13533,"""Connection to the server has been terminated. Please launch the game again.""
""Okay."" I said. ""This game will work after my 8th attempt"" I told myself. Still nope. After giving this game about 17 tries later i decided to actually be smart by unistalling this game but sadly, that didnt work either. My computer said ""Connection to the server has been terminated. Please launch this pc again""
""13/10 potatoes. GOTY Material"" - IGN
GG game no re."
13534,"umm... well i was thinking of a awesome counter strike game, that would have that CS feel. I was wrong, i played a little of everything. so here are the pros and cons:
Pros:
-Good crafting interface (u are able to craft different equiptment with all the bluprints you find)
- TONS OF GAME MODES, AND MAPS!
- SO-SO A.I. 
- cool classes ( a new improvement from the originals)
- TONS AND TONS OF WEAPONS!!!

Cons:
- bad graphics, (i couldnt change any of the graphics, so sometimes it was buggy, and othertimes i guess it was fine. looks nothing like CS-GO)
- A.I, the zombie A.I was terrible, all they did was slowly wander. they wern't smart i could run past them, literally next to them, and they wouldnt attack me)
- rely has nothing related to all the other counterstrikes.
so in conclussion, this game may satisify some, but not me. I didnt like it as much as i thought i was going to. But hey if you want to test it, be my guest."
13535,"Interesting  game and idea, based off the CS:S zombie mod.  The build mode looks like it could potentially be fun.  As of beta, clipping issues are horrible.  Latency is less than 100, and i can't tell if I'm hitting the zombies or not.  i NEVER see damage coming, so it's impossible to avoid.  Overall it just runs terribly. Also, there's no real 'instructions' on the 'build mode'.  Someone managed to get a gun, told me i needed to find an ATM.  I did, but couldn't do anything with it.  Something the intially looked/sounded awesome quickly turned into frustration, and i lost interest completely.

The main menu is even worse.  It's in an awful resolution, and there's so much information on the screen you can't take it all in.  As a novice logging into the game for hte first tiem, i just didn't even care to figure it out."
13536,"I can think of some things better worth your time than playing this game.  Getting your eyes gouged out with a spoon, sitting on a cactus, and being sandwiched in between two speeding cars come to mind foremost.  In fact, reading the reviews people have written about this game was vastly superior to playing the game.

The menu screen is locked at 1024x768, guaranteed to fuck anyone with multiple monitors over.  My windows shift around after going into the menu, and it's very annoying to constantly have to move them back to their original position after playing a game.

The FOV is locked to 90, which is horrendously short.  Come on, what is this, the latest Call of Duty title?  

You start with a very limited amount of ammo, which isn't NEARLY enough to take out a single zombie player, let alone the many zombies that will inevitably be running at you.  The zombies can take WAY too much damage.  And to top it all off, if they so much as touch you, you're a zombie now too.  You never had a chance from the beginning.

The only way to win is not to play, which honestly is the best option."
13537,no words to descride how terrible this is! it's ugly the UI and menu's are the most cluttered and confusing iv'e ever seen! should of use HL2 engine. what waste could of been gtreat this game has a cheap chinese feel to it. no thanks!
13538,I'd rather play 1.6
13539,"A poor mans Counter Strike...
"
13540,"No not even fun to play, I picked a name and someone already had that name and the game crash. Don't waste your time with him"
13541,"Yeah. I recommend this. This game isn't half bad, knowing how its in Open Beta Testing. It does have a few things that threw me off, like it lags a little bit, and it is very glitchy. Otherwise, it's the best steam shooter game I have. Why? Creativity. Soccer? Check. Homing snowmen robots that have squeaky shoes and self destruct, and have evil faces? Check. Counter-Strike 1.6 Graphics? Yes. Awesome weapons?? To me, yes. Cool maps, from CS1.6? Yes. I recommend it to anyone who has a low budget and really wants CS 1.6 or something. Also, disagree with me all you want, negative comments, I love this game. I also to plan to play waaay more hours."
13542,Withlag and the game crashing all the time it's not worth it. Two gamemodes are the only mode to play and the lag makes it unplayable. Play Counter Strike Go instead.
13543,"Ummmm.... the zombies one-shot you and have way too much health.


It's a game of hide or you're ****ed."
13544,Game is crap. would not play
13545,"Piece of Crap.
Pros:
-Doesn't Crash
Cons:
-The Game itself"
13546,"It's a pretty okay game for a Free2Play Counter-Strike game with zombies.
Even if you do not like the zombies you can still do the Search & Destroy mode!

I give this game a 7/10 for a okay game!

UPDATE: Game turned into minecraft with less features! Would not recommend!"
13547,"Save yourselves 60 dollars and skip buying Destiny, this is the same game but better."
13548,"This is a pre-Alpha mod, if that. If you are constantly moving, you do not take any damage from these ""zombies."" Texture qualities are bad and the 1024x768 cap on the resolution is just unintuitive. I would also like to know why I can join normal demolition 1.6 games. There were seriously 5 full servers for zombies and the rest were normal demolition. I guess the only positive is that it is free, but does free outweigh mediocracy? I don't think so."
13549,Not worth your time.
13550,"I'm going to say this first and foremost: it's still in beta. Those who are giving the game negativity and getting connection errors don't realize that the game will improve with time; right now it's getting a huge amount of traffic because of so many people wanting to play this under-the-radar release on the first day. The Counter-Strike name is HUGE, so of course when there's a free version of a huge game, people will flock to play it. (But also, Nexon servers aren't the best.)

It's a port of Counter-Strike Online from Asia, so it's basically a free version of CS 1.6 but now with added features (like the cool crafting system) and having zombies as the main selling point. I had a fun time playing the game, even if it was for a short while. I'd recommend it for those who want just a quick burst of fun or if you've never played any CS game before. Best of all it's free, so if you don't like it you can easily uninstall it and come back to it another time when the beta is over if you want.

The only thing I would ask for improvement are the menus and easier ways to access what you want when you're in a session. Right now it feels clunky.

PS: Seeing all the F2P nubs not knowing how to crouch-jump is hilarious."
13551,"Poor graphics, poor gameplay, shitty weapons, and overall not too great.
However, if you want to kill lots of zombies and don't have the money for L4D2, you could do worse.

Overall it can be a fun experience if you're lucky enough to not be subjected to the bugs that many people seem to be having problems with and can overlook the poor design elements."
13552,100/100000
13553,Please don't waste your time with this atrocious mess. It's just a shitty watered down version of CS 1.6 with zombies and a horrible interface.
13554,said there is somthing simular to speed hack on my pc butt theres not and then it force closes every time but the 10 min i was able to play it was fun
13555,"this game is awesome!
I love this game it is counter-strike 1.6 but has like 22 different mods,it has levels acheivments and awesome weapons! :D"
13556,"Can't even join a server.
Max Resolution is capped at 1024x786
"
13557,"I LOVE THIS GAME I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOREVER TO COME OUT TO THE USA. I PLAYED THIS GAME WHEN IT WAS IN BETA for KOREA. ITS SO FUN MAN EVERYONE NEEDS TO GET IT. GREAT THAT IS FREE 2 PLAY.  IGNORE ALL THE BAD REVIEWS ALL THESE KIDS ARE BUTT HURT THAT THEY CAN'T RUN THE GAME LOL. like a computer from 1998 can run this game. a toster could run this GAME LOOKS GREAT IN 1080p almost as good as CSS but its really more like 1.6. it bring back that classic feel but also with a lot of new stuff. I have never had a connection problem with this game so far. I really hope that they bring counter strike online 1 and 2 to steam also. I don't know what people were expecting its not going to be better than csgo. its more like a mod of 1.6, and its just going to get better and better. you guys will see. and the people that have a problem with the main menu is always in 1024x768 you can change it mine runs at 1080p. kids are just to young to play and don't know how to work a computer. 

game get an 11/10. just wait till they patch it if you can handle it.

13558,"Just awful, I know this is OBT but free to play games never changes. WOW is all I can say. That was really dumb and aside from all the problems in the main menu and with the game settings the gameplay was dull. At least Call of Duty: Zombies tries to develope interesting maps and uses original ideas to make their Zombie modes. Absolutely loaded with the same shit that makes all the other f2p games bad."
13559,GREAT GAME FOR FREE I LOVE IT I WOULD STILL PAY BUT THIS GAME IS AWESOME 10 OUT OF 10
13560,pretty dang horrible
13561,Zombies are too OP. Humans are basically worthless. WORST ZOMBIE GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE
13562,"So it's Counter-strike 1.6 with 0 upgrades... this mode is classic to a flaw, not including any maps or features found in CS:Source, then on the side, it's a pay to win pve zombie game with choppy animations and so many item timers that you'll be rolling your eyes all the way to the uninstall button.

The greatest flaw in the first person shooter/MMO market, in my opinion, is the reliance on item timers.  I don't know a single person who has bought one of these money sinks, and I don't think I'd like to know anyone that gulliable.  This stuff... this product you're selling us is already nonexistant... the least you can do is make the items permanent. 

Do you sheep really think this is a revolutionary new system???  Do you somehow have so many delusions present in your life that you have lost sight of what people really want out of a game?????  Answer these questions and I'll consider playing again."
13563,"The problem: Graphics, sound effects, weapons, balance (zombie modes), other stuffs.

The good:

Don't bother with this game."
13564,wow
13565,"Listen, almost 65% of the people that Downvoted this game only down voted it because their servers were having issues. I've gotta say, I played this game for a good hour with the servers only shutting down once for 5 minute maintnence, and I hopped right into a Original Defusal game on Inferno. I felt right at home. This game is basically CS: 1.6 F2P, with a few added items that may look a bit familiar if you played Combat Arms or Crossfire in your childhood. 700+ Hours on CS:GO, and this game FELT like a CS title. (Keep in mind, this game is in beta) This game has all of the original 1.6 maps, as well as a zombie mode. I haven't gotten a chance to play it, but I'm going to say it's probably like Crossfire's/Combat Arms zombie game mode, which is pretty cheap but aye, you're not paying anything for it. If you're a fan of CS and wanna try something new because you're tired of the Dust 2 Comp over and over again on CS:GO, give this a shot. It takes a bit of getting used to, but in the end, it's (Almost) the same CS 1.6 we loved years ago."
13566,One Of The Worst Game's Of The Year. Its SOO Bad Its Not Worth Free
13567,I don't like this game...
13568,"The way the game looks, it looks horrible, it's like combat arms, but even more horrible, i don't recommend you to play this crappy game."
13569, I really like it :} fun
13570,when i start the game it says server terminated
13571,its made by nexon
13572,its an ok game 4.5/10
13573,This is a very laggy CS 1.6 port. There are no zombies. Go play 1.6
13574,"First time loading CSNZ up, its clear a good few issues plague this game: The amount of menu's just to play a match, I can't remember it being this hard on a CS game before? I'm still not sure how I got to play! The first time around? Zombies are so hard to kill! purely on the amount of bullets needed just to down one. I'm sure thats where teamwork comes to play but most of the team either doesn't know what to do or have jumped out of this game never to touch it again. Its a shame as it looked to be sooo much fun and as a Zombie fan, it breaks my heart to say most zombie modes disappoint in there current form.

Where I do think this should be downloaded is purely on the fact CS 1.6 in its classic form lovely TR Vs CT for anyone that hasn't got CS or CSGO. Its free of course."
13575,"Zombies are extremely overpowered. The original game type is pretty fun, but the aiming is terrible compared to CS Source and CSGO. The resolutions are a like messed up, for instance when I put it on 1920 x 1080 I have big black bars on the side of my screen.  Honestly don't waste your time playing this. Get source, and play the zombie game modded servers, and get CSGO for the competetive gameplay. 

P.S.   The game is based on Counter strike 1.6 so don't expect good graphics."
13576,"> I enter a server
> Didn't know what to do
> Became a zombie 
> Every human was camping on a vent
> The round lasts 2 minutes.

> Next round every human decided to go to the vent.
> Everyone got stuck.
> Round lasts about 40 seconds.

11/10"
13577,better than csgo
13578,What do you get when you combine CS with NEXON? PURE AWESOMENESS!
13579,"So far i've had fun with this game up until it gets rudely taken away by the connection issues. it's a game that sense it's only a beta i can give it the benfit of the doubt. But if it keeps up with this, it's no wonder why people don't bother with it. Still, a Beta, lets give our strong words when the game has problems when it comes out, shall we?"
13580,"So after playing the game during the official release, I see a lot of the problems that were present in the beta are still there! Why do I have to restart the game every time I lag out of a match? Thought that would have been fixed by now. The Screen is still capped to 1280X720 and I am unable to change the graphics quality."
13581,"Ive played cs for 15 years, and ive never seen it stoop to this level of shit before. the original zombie 1.6 mod was 1000x better then this, the maps are dark, there is no real zombie classes, the guns shooting you as a zombie push you back so  youre 100% helpless. the maps are super dark, the menu is clustered with ""GIVE US MONEY"" buttons fucking everywhere.

Fuck you nexon. Fuck you."
13582,"This is essentially Free to play 1.6 I downloaded for zombies, ended up playing pubs instead. 

Not bad."
13583,"Based on 1.6? in 2014? Seriously?

Took ages to get in, no explanations as to what all the options, crafting and skill points etc were about. No clue as to how the game actually worked.

Then it crashed.

Rubbish."
13584,A game that only an ign reviewer could love.
13585,I HAVE TO SAY THIS GAME IS ACTAULLY GOOD I DONT PLAY ZOMBIES I JUST REK ON CLASSIC!~is it me or is there a bunch of noobs playing i get 20+ games everytime so it does get boring but ima make a frag movie so i guess its fine
13586,"This game isn't as bad as people are saying it is. You can definitely tell it needs work but it is in Beta. Are the graphics good? No they look like the original Counter-Strike. Is it revolutionary? No. Are you going to spend money on it? Probably not. But it's a free game that's a pretty good diversion if you're bored. It plays just like the zombie servers on Counter-Strike for the most part but if you don't have a Counter-Strike game, well then here you go. You don't have to pay for it or spend any money on it, so don't expect it to be perfect and if you don't like it just uninstall it."
13587,"ignore the other bad reviews, i think this game is 8/10, with for me is Awsome!

+pros
- free
- fun!
- friendly and competitive community
- no hackers (yet)
- not many bugs
-uses gold source

+cons
-menu screen animation has nothing to do with the game (counter terrorists fighting a dragon?)
- some map exploits being overly used
( i know not many cons, but it is a good game)

+ what needs work
-the zombie models should look like ct's (expet for ""patient zero"")
-the attachment/mod system to guns should be a bit better
-i really dont want to have a password for the gun mod system

that is my review, hope you found this usefull 

overall you should play the game, the connection terminated thing is beacause of people chooseing asia instead of europe/america"
13588,wont even open...
13589,"Trash


griefers paradise btw."
13590,"this is....a ps4 game......... 
dang....."
13591,"For the record, this has been around in both regular and zombie variants in South Korea since forever. I don't get why Nexon would just bring this over here one day out of the blue, but here it is.

Anyway, Imagine a free to play version of that zombies mode everyone liked when they were 12, complete with microtransactions for guns and such, bundled with a few weird sven coop type missions. It's about as jankey as you'd think  korean CS 1.6 would be.

Don't play this, unless you want to find out how much of a shitshow it is."
13592,ok but can get quite boring
13593,worst game of 2010 good try cs to make money again
13594,"To be honest i absolutly love this game im a huge fan of cs and all mods associated and i see so much possibilities with this form of cs i know its pretty much a giant mod for cs but as a f2p game goes this is probably one of the best shooters next to tf2 thats f2p im shocked that its a nexon title i must admit i havnt always liked what nexon puts out but this is a perfect step in the right direction 
Graphics-its Counterstrike we all know cs isnt known for its graphics
gameplay-endless modes and scenario seems to never end which is actually a good thing and the ""fun"" modes are actually fun plus constant challenges for all modes makes it more rewardin then todays f2pfps 
sound-again its counterstrike :)"
13595,"Don't see what all the hate is about, first game for me went fine.
Reccomended if your friends don't have Counter Strike 1.6 and want to spend nothing."
13596,"If you've ever played an FPS in which you had to have coins, or real money, to buy guns in game, and if you've played a generic feeling FPS game in which you faced waves of zombies while trying to traverse through the map, then you'll already know how boring this game will be. Save your time and play something else."
13597,"poorly made game, could have been alot better if more time was put into it"
13598,"its literally the original counter strike but with crappy amxx mods and a shitty interface
you should probably expect this game to be p2w and have hackers everywhere within the next month"
13599,Basicaly - same as CSO. You will like it if you know how CSO looks
13600,no...
13601,Save up ten dollars. Get 1.6. There you go.
13602,It's like Counter Strike but with everything you don't want to see in a CS game.
13603,Don't install this game. CS 1.6 zombie mods are 100x better.
13604,CS nosteam die :)
13605,"Tried it, hated it... Just go buy Counter Strike 1.6."
13606,"Is this a joke? Horrible in every aspect. Maybe if this came out 15 years ago but there are too many similar, far better games to play. Avoid! Uninstalling..."
13607,But do Zombie really win?
13608,Connected. 10/10
13609,"Its a carry over of the original CSO modification of Condition Zero advertised as a micropayment version of CS for Asian countries. Im SO HAPPY ITS FINALLY HERE. It has all of the game modes as before, sparing no maps, and they even reworked the microtransaction system so it isn't Pay2Win anymore, but all weapons are in stock (Before you had to buy a hand ful of them from the store with points) and you can onyl craft special weapons. While you can buy/pay for consumable bonuses (in which are almost always used in team work mode)

A very fun game with a lot to offer :)"
13610,"Got a wierd message closing my game saying I'm moving at the speed of a speed hack o.O .....
WTF"
13611,"Well i can say this, and hear me out, this game is really fun, sure the launch of the ""Open beta test"" was a little bit of a disaster, but its been fixed and really, i played this game back to when it was only in asia as Counter Strike Online, i put so much time in it because i had alot of fun, i don't let a stupid little issue ruin my fun with a Counter Strike game. This game is really worth looking into, just don't expect the graphics to be ground breaking, this isn't CS:GO, please, this brings back great memories with CS:CZ and 1.6. its a blast from the past with some awesome new game modes and Co-Op. Besides, i wanted to play this game as CSO but really, the lag killed it for me there, now its alot better."
13612,"Not to bad,but,they can do better.
6/10 Just try it"
13613,It is doing this error because that name has been taken!!! Try a different name
13614,would proberly be a pretty cool game... if it achully started up...
13615,"C.S with free content microtranactions skins  guns.
Good game not graphic wise but gameplay value and what u get from this is CS with some very fun things give it a try don't judge util you play it."
13616,Nope.
13617,"If you want to experiance the let down of Watch Dogs again, this is your game. I looked forward to it, and it sucked.
2/69"
13618,Huge letdown. Watch_Dogs 2.2269
13619,It's like low-res Vietnam with zombies
13620,Basically just 1.6 with zombie skins.
13621,"""The zombies will be back""
The best thing to fix this game is let me get a wider screen resoultion and less announcer commentary. I find it annoying to hear ""The zombies will be back"" over and over again."
13622,I'm not sure if this is serious. Hope it's just a joke.
13623,the worst game ever dont download you will delete it straight after 1/10 gay
13624,"Well, for the time I have played i cant tell what im playing. Is it minecraft? Call of Duty? Some old timey Resident Evil rip-off? You tell me pal cuz this game is one of the wo-BEST games i ever played. 13/6 wud quikscop freakishly wierd zombie monster things again"
13625,"Bun jocul doar ca e o problema cand intri in joc iti apare Connection to the server has been terminated. Please launch the game again,sper sa se rezolve chestia asta in rest e un joc reusit si distractiv mai ales sa te bati cu bosull de zombie :)) ! bafta la jucat"
13626,Good game) Those people who remember the old zombie modes for Css and cs1.6 will be happy .
13627,i enjoyed this game better when it was downloading
13628,"The store page says single player but it seems almost impossible to start any game between the connection errors and the difficulty in even atempting to start or play any server and gamemode. Hopefully the creators of the game will improve the user interface and allow single player and multiplayer to be more easily accessed, until then this game is not worth the effort to play."
13629,"- A remake, or actually, a transplant version of Counter-Strike Online in Asian region w/ less content in every aspect.
      - Fewer weapons
      - Fewer maps
      - Fewer modes
      - Enhancing success rate is low as hell
      - A HUGE chance of level drop when enhancement fails
- Server is under maintainence, please check announcements on website.
- Connection to the server has been terminated. Please launch the game again.

Overall, 10/10 as a uninstallation simulator and Connection Termination Simulator. Counter-Strike? Nahhh, forget about it."
13630,dont play this game its just so bad mechanically speaking i tryed to play this i really did but i just cant stand how badly balanced everything is. the way its currently balanced its in such a way that someone will get screwed. and that stupid piece of shit rentogear system please get rid of it its worthless its trash all it does is spoil the game i wanna keep my damn equipment not rent it.
13631,"I give this game 2 out of 10 Awp's please unnerf
"
13632,Fun for people who have never played Counter-Strike.
13633,"It's a fun game to play with friends. The only problems are the connection ones, but the game just realeased, so I can forgive on that one.



I recommend this game to anyone, just find some friends to play with :P"
13634,"shit

6 years later: still dogshit, hard to play with friends"
13635,Been waiting for this for ages! :D
13636,"Keep getting the ""Game Requires Steam Error"". Windows are locked at 1024x900 and it looks like trash. Best Uninstall experience ever 10/10"
13637,This is one of the worst games I have ever played and this comes form someone who used to play a ton of WarRock (a game also made by Nexon)
13638,"When I first loged on I was hit by walls upon walls of exposition, and was shortly sent to a game only for it to crash moments later, more options for optimization would be nice."
13639,"WTF is that?
its a joke ? that is shame for CS call this COUNTER
worst shit what I played on a lot of time...
go play to any normal ZOMBIE MOD on any CS is BETTER!"
13640,"It might not be pay 2 win in the bomb defusal mode (you get all weapons and it plays exactly the same), but all the servers are laggy and this means you get shot through walls ALOT, also, its basically just CS 1.6 but worse. (seriously like everyone I""ve played with has like 100-200 ping)"
13641,The best Counter Strike is a free Counter Strike.
13642,"Good that we don't have to pay for this shit.It has micro transactions just like CoD
and Connection issues are making it worst"
13643,"A good game.But when i tried to buy the""big support package"",it noticed that""Purchase couldn't be finalized due to an  error in steam"".Hope to solve it soon"
13644,Game crashes on launch 10/10
13645,THIS GAME SUCKS MORE THEN A HORE ON SUNDAY
13646,"I GOT TO SAY FIRST: I'm reviewing this from the point of view of someone that never played Counter-Strike or couldn't afford it.
I'm agreeing with some other reviews where people say that there is a lot of connexion problems (not in my case btw) so I can understand that it as bad ""notes"" on steam because of that; but maybe that will be patch later... Who knows ?
And also, I think the game is not that bad for a Free To Play. I mean: it's not like a sh*tty Pay To Win; here you can play some original maps from the original Counter-Strike series even without buying anything and you won't be always kill by the guy who buy his broken LMG 3$ a day. Not here.
So overall: it's not that bad if you want to play a CS without buying one.
But I recomend buying the CS series. 'Cause it's still better than this."
13647,"It's just CS 1.6 but now you have to pay real money for weapons that came with the game. There's some half baked experience progression that adds nothing to the game so far as I can tell. The console doesn't work properly and changes to video settings won't do anything until you restart your client--and there isn't an option to disable vsync, essential in any FPS.

Zombies mod? Already been available on CS 1.6 community servers for years

there is literally no reason for this poor Korean repackaging of community developed mods to exist"
13648,"This game isn't a shit: it's THE shit. Nexon, why are you still doing games..."
13649,worst game eu
13650,"this game rocks , i give it a 10 .   i had no problem with the game wat so ever .
my rig specs amd quad core 4200 fx 3.8 gzh 8 gigs of ram and a cool as intergrated video card 6450 hd windows 8.1 64 bit edition . i recomend this game to people plus its free , you cant go wrong with that ."
13651,–Ω—É –∏ —Å—Ä–∞–Ω—å
13652,At least the uninstall feature works properly.
13653,just play counter strike 1.6 the feel of the game is like gl_vsync is on retarded
13654,Its ok. not great though. It should be like CS:GO. Reminds me of palying CS:CZ so this is a 50/50 for me personally. Worth a try for all die hard CS fans who have played em all.
13655,Nexon is the best at destroying games.
13656,"Here's a little piece of advice, slick.
If you're looking for this type of game, go boot up Halo 3 and play the Living Dead playlist.

"
13657,"today it seems i found the keys to my delorean, i went for a ride and when i got out my dad was playing this game cs-nz or some shit like that, some fool stole my car and brought it back to the present its my mission to restore order."
13658,Instant Regret!
13659,CS 1.6... engine + so many modes
13660,"Not fun, barely entertaining.

It's literally you with any gun you want (Machine gun is the right choice) versus a lot of zombies that bottleneck to you and your teammates. 

Victory is achieved by rebuying primary ammo and using HE Grenades.

Ultimately, a 20 minute time sink until you get bored out of your mind."
13661,"After the patch for fixing the login errors i have to say, this game is actually incredibly good, This game seriously revolves around team work considering that zombies will kill you in literally 1.5 seconds. funny thing is i have absolutely no idea how to buy items in-game with points for classes and such. but ill eventually figure it out, anywho this game is a great time if you ever wanted to experience what counter-strike is like."
13662,"Awesome game!! Download now! 6/5!
=)))))"
13663,"I know it is open beta, so the game isn't finished yet.

Bugs so far: 
- Main screen is stuch on low res, messing up your screen settings. However ingame its all good to 1920 x 1080 which I use.
- Connection issues

Complaints that can't be fixed:
- it being half-life 1 engine, which these days is just not done. Unlike Quake Live which is a more smoot hand fluid engine, the half-life 1 engine isn't smooth enough these days for fast paced action. It's slow and clumsy and no scriptwriting can fix that.

As for the game being free to play: if you haven't played any Counter Strike game before and really want to have the good old experience, this might be just for you!"
13664,"Horrible, before you install this, uninstall it twice."
13665,ShitZombieSimulator1999
13666,"Feels like an outdated counterstrike's mechanics mixed with Combat Arms' zombie playstyle. Which is EXACTLY what it is. Unless you want to relive old CS memories by playing the classic gametype, I suggest you stay away from this game, because it doesn't offer much to the zombie game category as of yet."
13667,"Hmm , Game is real Counter Strike 1.6 Zombie Mod ..

First what i say is : Graphics doesnt matter , GAMEPLAY MATTERS !


But , This is much better than just a zombie mod , im a Counter Strike 1.6 player very long time and ZM isnt good there .

This Nexon Zombies mod , is much better  , with IG shop , events and even a  crafting 
It's like TF2 , but with zombies and with Cs 1.6 graphics ..

I saw some Source models too .

Personally i recommend it , need 2 try :)

UPDATE :

I'm Counter Strike 1.6 player like 10 years ,

THIS GAME IS AWESOME BƒªƒÄ , MUST TRY ! First 30mins will be so-so but later when you discover all that crafting bullshit its O.o 

JUST PLAY YOU WONT REGRET IT , AND ITS F2P .."
13668,This is basically CS:Online. What is good about this is that you don't have to pay to play this shi.tty game.
13669,this game is utter trash thank god no one has to waste their money on this game
13670,"I just don't know....not even close
if you like trash games yeah sure go ahead but....

I just don't know WTH i just played.

Would deinstall again. Still"
13671,"Looks like something that would be good to play but the fact that it's made off the 16 year old Source engine makes it a piece o' $h1te, I like the custimization and zombies but it always F*CKING DISCONNECTS YOU, AVGN SHOULD REVIEW THIS BIG PILE OF HORSE $H1T3, I'D RATHER HAVE A BUFFALO TAKE A DIARRHOEA DUMP IN MY EAR AND I'D RATHER EAT THE ROTTEN A*SHOLE OF A ROADKILL SKUNK AND DOWN IT WITH F*CKING SMIRNOFF"
13672,so cancerous i dont even know how to explain it
13673,"Counter Strike 1.6 with Zombies and Ingamestore and Level System. You can buy weapons for a specific amount of time or craft them for a specific amount of time. You can also buy zombies for a specific amount of time...That sure is a specific amount of time here. 

It's basically one of those Trash-F2P games. You either love or hate it.

EDIT: Not even the 10cent ingame Pack is worth it."
13674,nice
13675,"30tick listenservers. No thanks :D

Other than that it's pretty much an exact copy of CS 1.6 with some zombie shit on top."
13676,"nexon is so cheap, they just fuked up a good game."
13677,"so far only god thing in this game is that it's free... can't connect to servers, screen wont go to 16:9 res, if possibly you can get into server it will lag very much and eventually kick you out of server or sometimes even from the game, problem that occured most lately appears as the game wont start because ""the game is still running""... 1/10"
13678,"> Got into the game.
> Played the game.
> Uninstalled.

[spoiler]Seriously Nexon, what the balls is this?[/spoiler]"
13679,"If you can't afford an actual Counter Strike game, such as Global Offensive or Source, then this game is great for you.

Otherwise it's shet."
13680,"Very Good Game really fun to play with your friends

I undrestand if it has some bugs but it came out today so you can't say anything about it yet!"
13681,"Fun for a first few rounds, but after that it gets boring quick. Dissapointing, its ok I guess...their is also comp you can play..but thats about it. I would just play CSS for zombie escape or CSGO for zombie escape and comp. its ok."
13682,"Repetitive, no option for 1600x900 reso, controls are awkward for buying...
Just play Killing Floor or L4D2, or even Zombies Monsters Robots or w/e it's called."
13683,This game is epic !
13684,"Good when it works, which is never."
13685,No
13686,good game.
13687,"Going into this game.
I thought it would be ""okay"".
Oh how wrong i was.
"
13688,"""Hack sensor.
Debugger mode is working in the system.""
This guys are retarded. If I need debugger mode, I will use debugger mode and i won't stop using it, because some shitty game says me to turn it off. Fix your Anti-cheat guys.

P.S. this were some horrible 5 mins of waiting with this window open: http://puu.sh/bL35G/3e7434c4b3.png"
13689,"This is definitely the worst I have ever seen. Sure it is an open beta, but not working settings, unexplainable stupid buy menues and crappy graphics from 1998 are a no go. 
Although I had not yet the chance to even try a whole match because of all these bugs, my first impression shows the game is about money making only !

So good idea, highly awaited game and at the end A TOTAL FAIL"
13690,"Simple CS 1,6 with zombies"
13691,"Pure and utter shit, restarting  the game because of connection issues is the most fun part of the game. It is not nearly a representation of the actual counterstrike series and should not be recommended to anyone. They wouldnt even use games this shitty to torture people in Guantanamo. Had more fun shoving a banana up my ass. 

11/10"
13692,"This review at first was negative. I was mad because of the network problems and i wasn't able to play but after they fixed the problem I started to play around the game and to see its content.
The game turned out to be preety fun i don't know why people hate it.There are some really fun game modes you have to try out.Theres zombie scenario game mode which is your casual ""go do that while killing zombies"" zombie shelter was a real surprise to me because it offers actual base building,yes you and your team have to build a ""shelter"" and protect it from another team and zombies,while you gather other resources which will grant you victory.theres also your casual survival gamemode ""survive against zombies"". Thats all i have to say about this game.

10/10-I jizzed"
13693,"Just don't. There is no reason to play this game right now. It is basically uglier cs 1.6 with a pay to win options, tons of bugs, server problems and stuff. There seems to be a lot of different modes but most of them are bad. Not to mention that sounds and voices sucks as hell (seriously, my ears were bleeding after playing this game). The only reason to play this is because it is free to download, but most of you will end up uninstalling this ""game"". Maybe after official release it will get better."
13694,"THIS GAME IS 15/5 IGN. THIS GAME WILL MAKE U SO MLG! UNINSTALLED AFTER 2000,00 HOURS OF PRO GAMEPLAY,IF YOUR IN FaZe U WILL QUICKSCOPE THE CRACK ROCKS OUT OF THIS GAME.
420 420 RIP IN KILL NEXON ZOMBIESr( Õ°¬∫ Õú ñ Õ°¬∫)

13695,DON'T DOWNLOAD IT ! DON'T EVEN GIVE IT A TRY ! Do yourself something good and go with Killing Floor instead of that crappy waste of time.

13697,"With all the negative reviews i feel the need to say to the steam community, this is not a bad game, it's on an old engine, and has it's flaws, but i got no issue with connecting to servers etc, AND i had fun escaping them zombies."
13698,This game is terrible. Uninstalling now.
13699,NOTHING CHANGED FOR LAST YEARS THIS GAME STILL SUCKS
13700,"No knife that costs more then a real life knife, that's a good start."

-1 from me"
13710,This crap is a shame to Counter-Strike.. Stay away from it.
13711,This game gave me ebola.
13712,"Played better Zombie Game,,"
13713,Low game no open! Server is full!
13714,"Well, here are the things I liked about this game: .... 
Seems a bit short doesn't it? Well, that's because this game wouldn't even start up. It kept crashing on the main screen: 'connection to server terminated'. Those words will forever be engrained in my psyche, lodged deep within the recesses of my brain, only to be brought back to the forefront when I hear that ear splitting music playing, triggering some sort of mental breakdown akin to a Vietnam vet having flashbacks of his buddy's leg getting blown off in front of him. If you try to lower the volume of the music and apply it, next time you launch the game it's reverted back to it's old ways like a recovering heroin addict falling off the wagon. You'll want to do heroin after this so that analogy is very appropriate. This game was made with the intent to waste time, and waste my time it did. Those precious 30 minutes I spent downloading this piece of shit could've been better spent watching the autopsy of a loved one. Thanks a bunch you incompetent pricks."

such great connection quality and server quality.
such great lack of errors.
such amazing locked fov.
such amazing playability.

10/10. Give this game an award...












for being one of the most poorly functioned fucking games I have ever had the displeasure to download on steam. Fuck you. 

There is one actual benefit though:
You don't have to pay these ""developers"" money."
13718,I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants to smash their f**king PC into chunks

This is basically cs1.6 for free cant complain. Any game that is going to increase the number of CS players is good in my book

Keep in mind the Asia version, CSO, has been out for over 5 years and the counter-strike scene over their just isnt as big. So any game that will give more attention to the CS community is great.

With that being said I'm always dissappointed when a game has any attachment with NEXON (esp the NA division) as they are notorious for fucking their games and shitting on their fans. 

Verdict: Would recommend for new players, THAT DONT HAVE MONEY AND HAVE A LOW END SYSTEM, if you are going to spend any money just go buy CSGO its where the scene is right now."

13728,"Spanish: Lo poco que he podido jugar me ha gustado es basicamente el counter strike 1.6 con zombies, pero hay un error de conexion, pero esto es NORMAL cuando un juego acaba de abrir sus servidores, con diablo 3 pas√≥ lo mismo, con gta v tambi√©n, es NORMAL, y no por ello es un mal juego, simplemente hay muchas personas jugando a la vez, probad en unos d√≠a y seguro que ir√° bien.

English: the few time that i can play was very nice, is a good game, but have conexion problems with the server, but this doesn't matter, is very normal that a game that recent open the servers work bad, in gta v and diablo 3 was the same, this not a bad game, only have the normal problems at the launch, wait some days and it will work well."

13749,"Ok, now that the server issuses have been fixed, I am giving a more accurate review.

Is this game any good? Well, it depends. The concept behind this game is solid, but it has a poor implementation. Out-dated graphics, for instance. Also, it tries to be a CoD: BO2 Zombies or modded CS:GO. In my opinion, it doesn't live up to either of those games. Black Ops 2 is really fun, I played Zombies a lot on my console, but it's worth the time you'd put into it. This, at the moment, isn't.

If you want to play it, go ahead. It's your time, and not mine.

Will update if anything changes."

13754,"This game is a shitty game that calls itself Counter Strike the only thing CS related are the maps and the name. It seems like the just copied CS 1.6 and added some mods which you can find on any CSS or CS:GO custom server and they are better then this game. Also it startet crashing and deleting my settings for the first five minutes until i finally could choose my username which is unchangeable and isn't the same as your steam username and must not contain any characters that are not numbers or letters. following this you can't set the graphics higher then 1280x1024  so there is no option for hd quality and in this times it should be standard to have hd graphic settings. Given the fact that this game is free to play it probably will be full with hackers in the next days and they can create new accounts over and over again. Also given the fact that there is an shop for weaponparts this seams to become pay to win even if the publisher states that you can get all the parts by playing the game, but the question there is how long does it take you to get one part and how fast can you buy it? 
Ending this review  i have to say i spend more time writing the review than having to play the game without dieing because of how bad this game is and that it calls itself Counter Strike.
I think this is a very dark day in the CS history and i hope this game doesn't become very popular."
13755,"THE CONNECTION TO THE SERVER HAS BEEN LOST, THE GAME WILL BE TERMINATED"

13764,"Poor, and pathetic excuse for a game. Non-stop connection terminated from the servers. Nexon has made tons of poor games but this game is no where near their other games' level of pathetic, this game far exceeds it. Doesn't save any options you change. Cant even get into a game without my connection being terminated. Within 2 minutes of being on the main screen trying to change my graphics settings - ""Connection from the servers terminated..."" Non stop. Not even worth trying, If you want to play CS with zombies, go play CS:GO and use their zombie mod. Terrible standalone for zombies."
13765,This is a piece of crap

13768,"1.6 graphics in 2014... it is like watching a movie in 2014 which is black and white. The game is basically 1.6 with zombies. If you want zombies go play CS:GO, exactly the same but with better graphics, and it is the latest CS. To me this is a money filler, for the games that have died like Sudden Attack and stuff. DO NOT DOWNLOAD."

13774,Never let this awfull game offend my eyes again - a pure insult to all the counter strike games.
13775,played it 5min. and lost the connection only 7 times.. so i guess its better than cod. but cod can save my graphic und audio settings. overall the game is like i expect a game by nexon. shitty
13776,Game seems good if i'd stop being disconnected from the game server.
