0,I loved the part where Gordon Freeman bunnyhops all over the map and says 'It's Gordoning time'. Absolutely loved it 10/10
1,"Not gonna bother leaving a detailed review for such an old game, but I just wanted to say that it may have been worth purchasing back when it was released, but IMO it's horrible now, very boring."
2,I've played this game since I was a kid. I've played through all of the difficulty settings multiple times. This game is probably one of the best ones I have had the pleasure of playing as far as the story line goes. It has left me hungry to play well into my mid 20's. If you are looking for a game to capture your attention and puzzles that make you scratch your head. This is it. It offers you countless hours of entertainment. Whether you decide to play it once or multiple times. This FPS is one to have in your library.
3,"Game had a promising intro, got me kinda interested! But it fell off right after escaping from that window. It lost all sense of direction and progress and was just wander around aimlessly till you find some unexplained thing that's not at all what you'd expect. It's just so fucking bad. No sense of what the heck you're meant to do or where to go. The most fun I had was throwing boxes at people and irritating the cool cop guys. I assume this game gets better as everyone loves it. But from what I played? God, I've ever played something so directionless since Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach, and even that game has more direction than THIS. IT'S LIKE A MAZE WITH NO EXIT!"
4,It's just not as good as the original...
5,"If you see Dr. Breen, tell him I said ""FUCK YOU!""

Currently replaying this using MMod, and holy hell, what a mod. Just figured out how to track my hours using it as well. For anyone interested, see below.

- Copy ""HL2MMod_HL2"" and ""HL2MMod"" folders inside ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life 2""

- In Steam right-click on Half-Life 2, Properties, Set Launch Options... - type ""-game HL2MMod_HL2"""

7,its a good game its fun and everything
8,"Half Life 2, one of the best games ever made! You already know what this is, so go buy it!
But if you don't know what a Half Life is, I'll tell you a bit about it:

Half Life 2 Has you assume the role of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist (that's right, he doesn't even know real physics), who has been dropped 20 years into the future after an alien invasion which he caused. Now he must fight to save humanity!

Why you should play it:
1. It's Half Life 2
2. The combat is advanced and fun
3. The environments are fun to explore and stunning
4. Amazing graphics, for a 2004 game!
5. The storytelling is on another level of brilliant!

Why you shouldn't play it:



Moving on...

Please consider playing this game if you want a great PC gaming experience! And this is coming from a guy who doesn't like FPS games."
9,"Never finished, developers waited too long to finish the story so they decided to retcon it with their VR game. It's good, but it will never be finished in the way it was supposed to be."

21,"Its a half life game, need i say more?"
22,"I hope this review isn't as long as a redditor's diary, but here are my thoughts on this game. Half-Life 2 is a great game. In my opinion it's massively better than Half-Life 1. The visuals still look decent and for 2004, they are fantastic. This game makes HL1 look like Space Invaders if you compare them side by side. This game feels like an adventure, which is very apparent during Highway 17. It also somehow feels open, despite the game being very linear. The game's difficulty is kinda inconsistent - some chapters are extremely easy, but other chapters (Nova Prospekt in particular) has some bullshit difficulty with stupid turret defense sections and a battle against 2 gunships where you barely have any cover. And last - the achievements. they are pretty easy to get, with the exclusion of Lambda Locator, which is very annoying to get."
23,this game is older than me and easily is my favorite game

33,"Goated game all round, holds up still in 2022 and still better than most modern games right now"
34,"One of the finest games ever created. Like the original Half-Life, it changed it's genre forever."

42,"really good game, trying to beat it but so far really great!"
43,"This was THE game that I created the my first over-the-top, no expense spared, computer back in the day.
Man I loved this game and it still holds a great spot in my heart and mind for what Valve did with this game.
The entire storyline , to me, was fantastic from start to end, playing like an ongoing cinematic experience with tons of twists and distinctions so that gameplay does not get repetitive. 
This is one I would love a complete remake for 2020+ graphical hardware."

55,"Like Half-Life 1, Half-Life 2 is a solid classic and a must-play for anyone who wants to be able to claim some knowledge of the great video game classics (HL2 is to games what Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, or, more fittingly, Orwell's 1984 is to books).  I'd also recommend it to those who are just looking to have fun."

I recommend it tottaly from personal point of view but i warn you its not for photoepylepsyc people because when you shoot the gun it flashes and may damage your mental health :D :( :D :( :D :( :D :(  yes yes play it forever non-stop until the world colapses

116,"This is probably my favourite ever FPS...certainly n my top 5. I played this back when the Orange Box was released and still sticks in the memory. 
It has stood the test of time and still as playable as it was 18 years ago (incidently this was released in the greatest game release month all time, Nov 2004 was stacked top to bottom, google it if you don't believe me)

This has Great varied environments, great weapon variation, good pacing and does few things wrong.
The only complaints i have is at times no map marker can be a pain and tough to work out where to go (Although no where near as big an issue as Black Mesa)
The save system can also be troublesome as there were a few occasions where the auto save was rendered useless as I would be in a position of instant death or with next to zero health therefore i would save often if i were you.

On the whole I enjoyed replaying Half Life 2 and it dereves it's place in gaming folklore,"

138,"My first experience with Half-Life 2 was on the Xbox 360 with the Orange Box. I loved and completed Portal and played Team Fortress 2 with my friends quite often, but somehow never got into playing Half-Life 2. I tried starting the game multiple times but never got into it. Years later and a new PC, I decided to buy the Half-Life bundle. I decided about 2 weeks(ish) ago that I was going to complete every Half-Life game. Half-Life 1 and the expansion packs were pretty good, but when I started Half-Life 2 again, it was different... in a good way. It went from a shooter game with a simple story, to an exploration shooter with a very different but fascinating story with great characters. You can tell that the developers did not want to be bound down by the previous game and wanted to try something new with the Half-Life franchise. I really enjoyed playing this game and I cannot wait to complete Episode 1 and Episode 2."

One of my all time favorites, great story and graphics for the time. It has good mechanics when it comes to game play. 
I used [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/290930/HalfLife_2_Update/] Half-Life 2: Update [/url] and [url=https://www.moddb.com/mods/hl2-ep2-enhased-mod/downloads/half-life-2-mmod-version-13] MMOD [/url] during this playthrough, it adds changes to the lighting, bug fixes and overall made the game more immersive. If you haven't played HL2 before I would 110% recommend it. I wish I could go back an experience it for the first time again."
160,This is a horror game
161,Good old days.
162,good
163,skip half life 1 play this instead
164,"this game is super amazing i hope you could continue half life 2 Episode 3
"
165,"My god this game is good, still in 2022.

Intruding and sometimes vauge story that you want to know more about, great fps gameplay, dreary yet beautiful locales that fit the theme so well, and interesting mechanics strapped onto the fps to keep the game fresh level to level. That‚Äôs not even mentioning the amazing puzzles via the games physics engine. AND THE GRAVITY GUN. 

Hard to believe it‚Äôs almost 20 years old. Still an amazing game by 2022 standards"
166,"Half-Life 2 is one of the greatest video games for a good reason. It's amazing story, heavy action game play, graphics that were out of this world for a 2004 game, the impressive physics engine ""source"", and that it improves on the original game on every aspect (which was one of the best video games) were all what made and still make it into one of greatest video games ever. You definitely can make the argument that it's the greatest video game FPS ever. The only bad part about the game is the fact it ends. Half-life 2 is easily the greatest video game I have ever played so far in my life and I cannot fathom how another game will top it for me."
167,"Very awesome game
"
168,Whats not to like? Half Life and all the following episodes was and still is the pioneer of immersive world play genre styled gaming. Detailed and explorable on a level that is hard to find today. Valve set the bar many years ago and i've yet to see an equal platform. Much respect to the Valve development team. I challenge anybody who can only play though all episodes just once!

185,"Worse than the first game. It's really boring. I loved the first game, but this just fucking sucks. It's overrated and overhyped. I only liked ravenholm, because it's the only fun part of the game."
186,"Very good game. Good storyline and very good AI for it's release in 1998?? I'm still shocked it really did come out in 1998. Most people that play this game probably were born around that time. How is the graphics so good for it's time? No wonder Garry's Mod grew to popularity.

Pros: Good storyline, Good AI, Good Graphics.

Cons: Not knowing where to go/Not intuitive."
187,"I heard that this game is amazing, many gamers recommend it...
And I can partially agree.
The story and setting of this game is amazing and I absolutely love EVERYTHING about the Combine... but the gameplay is mediocre at best.
Let me explain why.
The combat is quite dull, mostly just frustrating.
The platforming is annoying as fuck.
I got constantly lost, not knowing where to go. I figured I was a dumbass, and went on Youtube to look up a walkthrough. I hop in the comments and what do I see? Other people get lost in this game all the time!
And I know this is an old game, it's the favourite game of many... but it has faults. To me, if not for the story this would be a negative review.

Hail the Universal Union."

219,"One of action game masterpieces.
It is so unique how well Valve shuffle level types, creating a flawless experience.
At one point you are inside chaotic battle with rain of bullets. Few moments after you have a safe place with dialogues. After that game brings you a horror level with puzzles. Want something else? Here, take this vehicle, ride and shoot :)
I enjoyed OST every time I heard it, track are really good.
And of course, start and end of the game are a bit mysterious :)
There is a portion of humour also.
Sometimes you will definitely think about some popular movie/book references during the game in a forms of levels or enemies :)
There is no point to say much more,  all HL games are very good, just play them and enjoy.
I wish such kind of games have also been made nowadays."

229,"Quite possibly the best game I've ever played! No cut scenes, just plain storytelling as you progress through the campaign. The graphics remind me of the COD series, and the mechanics are very resilient. It might seem difficult to comprehend the situation but it's not, rather easy to control and the use of firearms. I also really liked the characters, Barney is probably my most favorite. Highly recommend this game!"
230,"absolute chad game. my favourite of all time. personally believe everyone should play it, (if any of my friends see this pls ignore me I'm going through the community badge stuff lol)"
231,Good Gmae
232,[retty good gmae
233,This game is a genuine masterpiece. I think everyone should play through this game at least once. The graphics are a little dated but still hold up for a game that came out in 2004. The story is very interesting through out and the game play is amazing. The gun play again is a little out dated but still works perfectly for this game. The characters are interesting and compelling. I highly recommend for everyone.

Game design and innovation are still exemplary in 2022.
The characters, maps, story and weapons are memorable.
Every play-through can be different, thanks to the physics and the tools at your disposal; today was the third time I've replayed it since 2004, and I've discovered something new again and got as far as to unlock all achievements.  Our world would be a lot better place if all the developers created every game with such care and attention to detail.

299,"Half-Life 2 is an amazing sci-fi first person shooter which is set in 1998 where the world is being controlled by a abusive police force as zombies roam the streets. You and the resistance have to fight your way through hoards of zombies, creatures and police using a unique selection of weapons from shot guns to RPG's, you can even use a gravity gun to move and throw objects around as you collect weapons and armour to aid you in your journey. 
Graphics- Great
Soundtrack- Brilliant
Audience- Teenagers and Adults
Difficulty- The story is alright difficulty can be hard at points 
Story- Great story 
Game time- Story is pretty descent length
Price- Its cheap for what you get

300,"barnacles are scary :(
that's why i stopped after 2 hours
that being said, this game is a timeless classic. Valve's game design holds up well after so many years, and being honest I would go down to say this game is one of the greatest of all time. The gameplay is extremely good, there are many secrets and being honest a bit of strategy is involved. Everyone should at some point give this game a try, no matter what their taste, even if it is only for 2 hours."

It puts most recent FPS games to shame. So much innovation and attention to detail. Physics are fun. It's got action, tense moments, horror, puzzles."

310,It starts with one
311,extra
312,"Half-Life 2 is an amazing journey from start to finish. I definitely recommend it to all gamers. 

On normal difficulty entering combat as a super soldier is engaging and fun. Battles with the enemy would often leave me scrambling for health and ammo. This greatly added to the game's thrilling nature. On a side not I also learned that I did not miss regenerative shields included by most modern shooters. 

The campaign features new weapons and mechanics compared to the original. They are expertly weaved in to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. 

Levels also feel large but not overwhelming. I admit i was lost a few times but never had to consult a guide to find my way.

I have a few critiques towards the game. The first and most annoying one is the addition of NPC's to your squad. I found they often got in the way, especially inside of buildings, and in combat they would often throw their lives away. This frustrating behavior made it extremely difficult to like them. 

My other gripe is having to cycle through the less impactful weapons in late game. The crowbar and SMG quickly get relegated by the superior gravity gun and assault rifle, but they are still first in the rotation. In Black Mesa i think the weapons in slots 1-4 felt equally useful throughout the campaign.

Anyway, HL2 is a great game. Just get it and play it.

320,its good
321,Its Half Life 2. THE Half Life 2. I don't need to explain much more about it. This game is the video game equivalent of the guy everyone knows based on their street rep and no one has to explain why.
322,"eli is a gay black nigga. so he instantly gets captured by the combine, you should get this game immediately"
323,fun
324,good my computer can stand it good storyline a little hard but good
325,yes
326,"One of the best shooters of all time, what more needs to be said?"
327,"[b][u]TL;DR (Short Version)[/u][/b]
This game literally made me throw up. Don't play it.

[b][u]Long Version:[/u][/b]
For my 100th review on STEAM (and likely the last), [b]I decided to do something I've never done before; I played Half-Life 2.[/b] What followed was quite thematic; if STEAM is THE Valve Product, and this 20-year-old game got half-assed controller support for a portable computer very few people will want or afford, [i]just  to sell STEAM[/i], then what does that say about Valve?

Using Steam, (sorry, STEAM¬Æ)‚Äî and I mean [u]really[/u] using it, actually getting into it's features and design ‚Äîis a lot like playing Half Life 2. They are both time capsule's, untouched and ignored for decades, from a time when see-saw puzzles were mind-blowing. I can and DO remember the collective orgasm we shared the first time we dropped a cinder block on a bottle and it shattered. It's stilla thrill! Flawed, absolutely, but the innovations here were absolutely peak design at the time. It's impossible to put into context for younger people whata leap forward it was to have objects rolling under their own momentum, The last big shooters before this one only let you gun, more gun and knife. [SIC]  Half-Life 2 a landmark, and it holds up fairly well just like Steam, the first forever rental service.

[b]And I think the irony is that the people who created these things don't care.[/b]

There's been a lot of hay about competing services and fan games that are at best decent recreations and at worst offensive being tacitly honored by Valve's seeming disinterest in its very own intellectual property. There's the hilarious College Humor sketch about the CEO of OREO telling people ""Guys? You can just stay home. We work at a money factory."" That's Gabe. Yeah, that Gabe.

For a decade I've collected a laundry list of lacking features and petty annoyances, oversights and redundant features. How can something that almost never gets updated have so much cruft? What is all the money from my 550 purchases actually doing? Probably not much.
Headlines were made this very year that Half-Life 2 received it's first update in 18 years. The update was to add joystick support at long last. I don't think anyone tested the game, because the flashlight... The FRIGGIN flashlight... isn't bound to a controller button and cannot be bound without hacking INI files like I'm still using MUCKFOTHERING Windows XP.

What in the Jesus, Moses and [redacted] did they even DO? This game was on the 360, so  know they figured this out already. [b]I was determined to play though this entire game but quit just at the BOAT, not even getting the Gravity Gun, because the boat's gun was ""<Not Bound>"".[/b]

.... This game was made when we still had CRTs. Gaming was primitive as Hell, and didn't have even 1/100th of the money it has now. So, I think we cared a lot more. That's why people still dress up as Team Fortress 2 Characters, why ""Cake is a Lie"" is a joke your mom knows. The Orange Box and its contents [i]meant[/i] something to people. They still do. I still find new Indie games with nods to Half-Life in the form of all-powerful Crowbars. Half-Life2 was such a big deal, they had ""Ready for Half-Life 2"" stickers on computers being sold in stores.

[i]This[/i] game, Half-Life 2, made [i][u]all[/u][/i] of Steam happen... If that was mine? It would be my baby. I would keep in pristine condition. Even SKYRIM gets better content and updates decades later. Why not the most important PC game ever, (probably second only to DOOM?)

They probably know that nobody really plays this game anymore. That's reason enough to leave it behind I guess, but I don't think Valve understands that their properties are rotting away because [i]they[/i] let it happen. And it made me personally, [i]as a gamer[/i] ask what I'm still doing here.

[b]This game made me sick. Literally.[/b]

The FOV starts at 75 and I was trying to play on my big screen TV. After getting turned around and heading the wrong way for the 50th time, I actually threw up in my sink. I had to look up how to HACK the FOV with cheats to get it down to 60. That made it bearable, but, again... Not Bound. This game is hazardous to your health. And Valve wants me to buy a VR headset? Ok..."

338,"(Don't mind the fact this review says I played this game for 6 hours, I played through this game with MMOD.)
This is the best game ever made.
Nothing made before or even afterwards has ever come close to the incredible storytelling this game has.
This game's graphics have aged a little since 2004. I mean sure, mods can improve the experience, but only slightly, so I really wish someone dedicated enough to this game (or Valve, if this were a perfect universe) can make a remaster in source 2 that's graphics look just as good as Half-Life: Alyx.
(In my opinion, I think the FakeFactory cinematic mod is trash.)
I hope Valve can finish Half-Life 3 someday and have it be just as good as the leaked plot by this game's writer."

340,wow
341,Awsome graphics still up to date and runs on bad pc's while still looking good and having smooth frames
342,Top 3 games of all time.
343,Words cannot express my joy when I found out they made Barney Calhoun a major character
344,best game ive ever played (also portal is good) but wheres 3
345,This is a great game for 2004 and I think it is a must buy game for 10$ and I think it is a 10/10 game
346,Why hasn't Valve made any new games please make more games I'm begging you!
347,It starts with
348,"It's Half Life 2. If you haven't played it, you need to; if you have, you know why."
349,"This game is good. The graphics still hold up to this day even though it was made back in 2004, the story is amazing and very immersive world building. Definitely recommend for anyone who enjoys story based shooter games, or anyone who is looking to play a slightly old first person shooter."
350,good ole fashion fun
351,A Classic game
352,very good
353,"dr freeman you're about to blow

354,"yes me love good game :) but has not great graphics
"
355,G U D
356,Pretty good game
357,"This is a Amazing brilliant game with excellent storytelling gameplay and graphics highly recommend.
My one problem is that there is no content lock like in half life 1. Witch is then making people resort to downloading a mod from the internet to censor out stuff. I personaly dont like the Creepy digusting looking corpses in hl2 witch is why I downloaded a mod to censor out the creepy corpses.

Overall Amazing game but needs a content lock."
358,"A truly amazing game. Made me cum in 5 seconds
"
359,ghjkl;
360,"In this grand adventure, you play as Gorgonzola Freed-Man on a new quest, to recover the galaxies stinkiest cheese. After the events of the first game, which consisted of Freed-Man ripping a hole in the space time continuum to find the galaxies stinkiest cheese, he must now take it back from Mr. Green, whom his hold up in his giant penis tower, safeguarding the cheese. With the help of The Alyx Vance and her father, The Eli Vance, Gorgonzola must overcome trials and tribulations to take back the cheese!"
361,"One of the most influential games I've played, and I still replay it every once in a while."
362,Unfortunately the models/props_phx/misc/potato_launcher_explosive.mdl does not make an appearance in Half life 2 so overall 9/10

370,"Just checking to make sure this game has an Overwhelmingly Positive amount of reviews.

Half-Life 2 is quite possibly the best FPS that exists.

Half-Life: Alyx is maybe the best VR game that exists.

I believe Left 4 Dead is the best zombie game that exists.

As a general rule, Valve does not release things unless they intend for it to be the best, or at least one of the best."
371,veery gud
372,"Definitely one of the best shooters ever and I feel like we need more shooters like this, shooters that don't take the control away from you for cut-scenes and don't take you out of the game constantly, just an immersive experience."
373,"Valve has a history of making games that, although dated in the current year, had not only pushed graphical boundaries for their games, but revolutionized video game storytelling.

This game may now look dated, but its gameplay and writing make this a contender for a perfect game."
374,"Claims to be a decent shooter game, but weapons were boring at best, enemies unintuitive, and action mild at best.  Physics were supposed to be an improvement over other games and realize the game came out in the early 2000s, but nothing to be impressed with.  O and.... HORRIBLE ENDING.... So much for great storytelling (not to mention no character development or associated stories).  Avoid."
375,"As for someone who's first time playing was the year 2022, this game holds up very well. Especially so considering it came out in friggin 2004 along side games like San Andreas, Spiderman 2, Halo 2, Sims 2, Doom 3, Far Cry, etc. This game was so ahead of it's time to point that it's actually retarded. The world building and atmosphere is absolutely wonderful, the physics are still awesome, the combat is super fun and intense. The whole story happening around you thing as well as the dialogue and subtle storytelling made me so engrossed and invested. Even when compared to games of today, it's rather simple on the surface, but it's super refreshing. It's was a super innovative and influential explosion in the gaming industry that still holds up as a fantastic narrative fps that I think most gamers should at least try once. 6/6"

388,Yes
389,The half life series is the best series of games I have played in my entire life. I cannot recommend this game enough!
390,One of the best first person shooters ever made. Still holds up shockingly great in the graphics department despite being released in 2004.
391,Awesome bro
392,good game
393,i used to play this game so long ago before i could remember things. Best game ever.
394, good game i hope you buy it
395,I guess it's okay. For a small indie title no one has ever heard of. I hope my review will get it a little positive word of mouth
396,what even just happened
397,"""Now, about that beer i owe you.. It's me Gordon! Barney! From black mesa!""

Barney, from black mesa
Everyone's favorite character and best quote. Am I right?"
398,"Very fun open world, but also gives an eerie vibe. Love the story and I found myself actually caring about the characters, even Gordon. Plus this is great if you have a slow computer because mine is pretty bad and it ran with no problems."
399,"Alongside the episode,   this game kicks ass.   Real shame we won't get a official continuation of some sort anytime soon.

And no,   Half Life Alyx pushing the story forward by 10 seconds doesn't count."

427,"I want to preface by saying that I like this game and I think its a good game.  I just don't think this game even comes close to being as good as people make it out to be.  I cant really say anything that has not been said though.  For 2004 this game was probably incredible, but unfortunately it is not 2004 anymore and I played this for the first time in like 2017 so I did not look at it with nostalgia goggles on.  I thought it was good but saying it failed to live up to the hype that everyone gives it is an understatement.  Once again I like this game I think its a great game, but I think a lot of you are really looking at it with rose tinted glasses.  I'm sorry if you disagree this is just my opinion on it feel free to disregard it if you want to.

8/10 is my final score"

All I know
It's so unreal
Watch you go
I tried so hard and got so far

I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself of a time when I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, they didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart

457,"This game is to me, the reason and the original game to ever appear and explode in this platform..

I love its graphics, the plot, the mysterious style in it is soooo amazing..

I would recommend it but play it after the first one to understand the whole thing .."
458,"It is now 2022, this game still holds. The voice acting, the plot, the action. If you haven't, go do it."
459,"Sometimes, I dream about cheese..."
460,love the game so far but holy fuck i hate the fucking hunter copper thing
461,fire game
462,"This is generally considered the game that launched Steam.
A classic FPS that has to played, a moving story with a silent protagonist."
463,good good game
464,My favorite chapter was Sandtraps. Everything to do with the antlions was amazing and the bug bait was underutilized.

467,"This. This right here is the goat of video game series. Portal, Team Fortress, Counter Strike, l4d, Steam, Gmod, Steam deck. NONE of these would have existed were it for the Half Life series. Half life walked so that Valve could run"
468,Nice
469,Fun
470,[spoiler] gordon goes on a big ass trip to kill one man. amazing. [/spoiler]

477,"Ah, what a good game. A real classic, and extremely ahead of its time of just 2004. Music, gunplay, story, revolutionary design, characters, and voice acting, all astounding, as per usual for the Half-Life series."
478,"Had to replay it recently because steam forgot my achievements (or they weren't a thing yet when it came out?). Still a great game, awesome atmosphere, timeless classic. ^^"
479,CLASS!

Definitely in my top 5
- The guy who plays a lot of video games"
490,"Yo I love Half-Life 2. Grew up playing The Orange Box on Xbox 360 (and I still play it on Series X) which was dope but it's def better on PC. 11/10 recommend. Some people say this is the best video game ever made... honestly it's up there. You know what would make it even better? Half-Life 3. Valve I know you're reading this. Please fam, it's been almost 18 years since this game dropped. Complete the trilogy. We all want it. <3"
491,good lol although the ending sucks on its own like literally the game just stops on the least satisfying cliffhanger possible but otherwise nice game the combat could have been served well by having more impact but yeah also fuck striders i hate striders shit game
492,yes
493,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me

Will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter"

523,"Simply a legendary cornerstone of gaming history. A technological marvel for its time, and still amazing today. I haven't seen another game that allows for such creative freedom with how you can interact with the environment. Despite the dated graphics, it still feels more immersive than many games do today.

There's a lot more I could say. Anyone with any interest in shooters, adventure games, video game history, or an interest in video game development should try it. There's a Director's Commentary mode that explains many of the tricks and technological advancements that made the game possible.

And if you just want a solid FPS story game with tight controls... it's got you covered on that, too."

Jesse, hop on Half Life 2"
525,"Best sci-fi single player FPS ever made. For over a decade there's been so much talk and so much hype about ""oh half-life 2 is so amazing it's the best game ever"" and ""this game is amazing you have to play it."" This game is admittedly extremely hyped up and extremely talked about.

I think all the noise starts to make people think the game itself is overrated. People might think ""ok it was good but is it THAT good?"" They're wrong. This IS one of the best games ever made. Bar none. Eighteen years later and this game runs laps around every modern FPS single-player campaign out there and it's not even close. Valve are MASTERS at level design and balancing combat with exploration and short puzzles.

If you haven't played this game, download it and play it. You can probably beat it in a weekend. Experience for yourself what PERFECT game design looks like in a brief, ~10 hour campaign."
526,yes
527,Hunt Down The Freeman was a better experience
528,dude just play it
529,Its a good game but why is nova prospekt so hard bruh

532,muito bom o game!
533,yes
534,"Short, but fun. It still holds up remarkably well for a game that was made almost 2 decades ago. Wish it could have been slightly longer but I'm glad that I picked this game up and finished it. 

Would definitely also recommend playing the episodes (1 and 2), they're fun sequels that add new things and are definitely worth checking out. In my opinion they are definitely not as good as the base game released in 2004."

537,"This is one of the most legendary games i have ever played. The gameplay is very intuitive, the storyline is very exciting and it's a very fun game. My only downside is that it ends on a cliffhanger and a third game is yet to be announced. Otherwise, great game and would recommend to others."
538,one of the best g√¶me ever
539,"It may be an old game but the game mechanics, game play has stood the test of time and is confirmed as a timeless classic. It would be great if this game had a unreal 5 graphics upgrade."

541,really fun game
542,"This game is 18 years old. 
It still looks great.
And it plays great.
I never got the beer from Barney though."
543,"The one who makes half life 2, didn't care enough to make half life 3.

Thats why i don't like him but because of the man, we have 'steam', we had a chancet to play half life 1 and half life 2, so as much as i hate him, i  also love him as well. 

Can you feel hate and love at the same time ? The one who had vision of hl2 made sure of us, that can be done easily. 

So thank you and i hate you!

544,If half life is half a life is a life half a half life aswell?

5/10"
546,"Oh mawh god,this is the longest game than the other Half Life.Just know that the soundtrack is SUPER FIRE!

547,this game makes you feel like gordon freeman.
548,"I used to play Half Life 2 on my Ps3 back when i was younger and on my old steam Account.
And after all this time, it still feels wonderful.

The Story is cool and intresting, the controls are amazing, the Graphics doesn't matter because the game is fun!

I totally recommend to buy this Masterpiece!
It's one of the best Games i've ever Played."
549,Game Make Me Happy
550,Box go *glitch through ground*
551,"This was my introduction to the Half-Life Series, back on The Orange Box on Xbox 360. Half-Life 2 is one of my favorite games ever and I am so glad to be playing again on PC at 1440p 165fps. If you have never played the Half-Life series before play all the games they are all great and have done so much to shape gaming as we know it today. Wolfenstein 3D birthed the first-person shooter and Half-Life perfected the formula for FPS storytelling. There is a reason people still make videos on this series 20+ years after launch. Everyone really owes it to themselves to experience Valve's magnum opus. Half-Life is nothing short of a masterpiece. Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommended."
552,"Phenomenal.  Absolutely phenomenal.  I finally got around to playing Half-Life 2 and was absolutely blown away by how well a game from 2004 holds up in 2022.  I laughed, I cried, I struggled, and I smiled.  This game was mind-blowing.  I'm not the one who needs to say this but HL2 is a must play.  I ended up playing the game in 8 hours straight (+1 hour a day before) because of how absolutely addictive Valve's writing is.  For a game that came out just 5 years after 1999's Half-Life, the stark contrast in quality and how well the game holds up is obvious.  10/10"

562,"It's simply amazing that a game made 18 years ago still looks this good today. The lore in this game is so good that players are still eagerly awaiting the next main entry in the series almost 2 decades later.

Definitely a must play game."
563,Half Life 2's story is really good and overall great gameplay

569,what cat?
570,"Amazing story, definitely buy this game along with Episode 1 and 2. Only downside is the fact that the story is not finished yet, after over a decade."
571,love it
572,"although not as consistently entertaining as half life 1 i think the sequel is a true feat of world building and immersive storytelling through gameplay, everything here is excellent but it is a very dry game that does feel like a slog at times with its lengthy character acting, big uninteresting outdoor maps and slower combat.

this game is even more memorable then the first though as each chapter brings in a new focus for the gameplay, some are better then others with some dragging on a bit too long like the aforementioned large outdoor sections

what i feel about half life 2 is that it lacks a certain magic from the original and i feel like is has aged worse in alot of ways
the game dosent have the razor sharp focus of the first game, half life 2 is quick to add in these level gimmicks that feel half baked, they are fun the first few times you play them but on repeat playthroughs they become increasingly dull
what i feel made half life 1 such a great experience is that the level design itself shook the gameplay up, not any gimmicks
half life 2 just feels kind of uncreative and overly concerned with its world building, its characters and its narrative (which it all does very well by the way) i just get way more tired playing this game then i do anything else.

but what this game does do very well is its atmosphere, immersion and its famous cast of characters. alyx vance is the first character in a video game that i felt a connection to as a player and the multiple set peices with them all hit so incredibly well, the best moments in half life 2 are when the combat and the story are one piece, when you feel like you really fill gordon freemans shoes and are fighting along your allys for something significant in the story, this game is excellent at that.

while i think the original game is of a higher quality in terms of pure gameplay i feel half life 2 is a very well made successor to that game where it tries new things and does most of them very well, its no where near as focused as half life 1 but it makes up for it with its excellent characters and world building."

574,"Half-Life 2 is a game that has changed gaming as a whole. Through its sometimes obvious and sometimes subtle storytelling and amazing worldbuilding, it makes an experience you will not forget.
Imagine buying the game on release in 2004 and taking those first steps into City 17 with the Citadel looming in the background. An astonishing thing to see back then - nowadays it's not that amazing but you still get a feeling as if it's all real. A very immersive game that holds uo to this day.

Alright enough with my crappy poetry, game is good, buy it, enjoy, glhf"
575,"John Freeman who was Gordon Freemans brother was one day in an office typing on a computer. He got an email from his brother that said that aliens and monsters were attacking his place and aksed him for help so he went.



John Freeman got his computer shut down and wet on the platform to go up to the roof of the building where he left his motorcycle and normal people close because he was in his office lab coat. John Freeman got on his motorcycl and said ""its time for me to live up to my family name and face full life consequences"" so he had to go.



John Freeman ramped off the building and did a backflip and landed. He kept driving down the road and made sure there was no zombies around because he ddint have weapon.



The contrysides were nice and the plants were singing and the birds and the sun was almost down from the top of the sky. the mood was set for John Freemans quest to help his brother where he was. John Freeman looked around the countrysides and said ""its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys"".



John Freeman was late so he had to drive really fast. A cop car was hiden near by so when John Freeman went by the cops came and wanted to give him a ticket. Here John Freeman saw the first monster because the cop was posessed and had headcrabs.



""I cant give you my lisense officer"" John Freeman said



""Why not?"" said the headcrab oficer back to John Freeman.



""Because you are headcrab zombie"" so John Freeman shot the oficer in the head and drove off thinking ""my brother is in trouble there"" and went faster.



John Freeman had to go faster like the speed of sound and got there fast because Gordon needed him where he was. John Freeman looked at road signs and saw ""Ravenholm"" with someons writing under it saying ""u shudnt come here"" so John Freeman almost turned around but heard screaming like Gordon so he went faster again.



John Freeman drove in and did another flip n jumped off his motorbike and the motor bike took out some headcrab zombies infront of John Freeman. John Freeman smiled and walked fast. John Freeman then looked on the ground and found wepon so he pickd it up and fired fast at zombie goasts in front of a house.



John Freeman said ""Zombie goasts leave this place"" and the zombie goasts said ""but this is our house"" and John Freeman felt sorry for them becaus they couldnt live there anymore because they were zombie goasts so he blew up the house and killed the zombie goasts so they were at piece.



Then John Freeman herd another scream from his brother so he kept walking really faster to get where he was. Ravenholdm was nothing like the countrysides there was no birds singing and the pants were dead and teh dirt was messy and bloody from headcrabs.



When John Freeman got to where the screaming was started from he found his brother Gorden Freeman fightin the final bosss and Gordon said ""John Freeman! Over here!"" so John Freeman went there to where Gordon Freeman was fighting. John Freeman fired his bullet from teh gun really fast and the bullets went and shot the final boss in the eyes and the final boss couldnt see.



Gordon Freeman said ""its time to end this ones and for all!"" and punched the final boss in the face and the final boss fell. John Freeman said ""thanks i could help, bro"" and Gordon Freeman said ""you should come here earlier next time"" and they laughed.



The laughed overed quickly though because John Freeman yelled ""LOOK OUT BRO!"" and pointed up to the top of the sky. Gordon Freeman looked up and said ""NOO! John Freeman run out of here fast as you can!"" and John Freeman walked real fast out.



John Freeman loked back and saw Gordon get steppd on by the next boss and he was mad and angry.



""I'll get you back evil boss!"" John Freeman yelled at the top of lungs.

It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

617,"This game is an absolute masterpiece. One of the most fun and exciting adventures anyone could ever have in a game. It is a sequel that not only lives up to the original but improves on it substancially (this is custom to Valve I suppose). The game never gets boring, its filled with strategic action, shooting, persuits and multiple characters filled with personality. I don't understand half the lore in this game but trying to build the narrative myself was insanely fun. Anyone with a monitor and a pc from at least 2005 should play this no questions asked. Modern gaming as a whole would not exist if it wasant for this game, Valve are absolute gods at making games (they aren't good at maintaining them tho #savetf2). One of the only games that I spent a whole weekend nonstop playing till it was done. You've read other reviews like mine, just play the game already!

656,"Following up something like Half-Life with a game that manages to further innovate to this degree is nothing short of masterwork. There's so much packed into the relatively short story (by today's standards) that shakes up gameplay constantly. Gone are the claustrophobic halls of Black Mesa, embracing much more open environments to fight the cosmically powerful combine. G-Man is so fucking dope, truly unsettling considering his small appearances. Ravenholm is still very spooky! Father Grigori as this insane helpful uncle brings their trademark dry humour. The gravity gun is such a singularly interesting weapon that builds upon Valve's prop fetish. The only free man... right?"
657,"[b] THE GREATEST FPS OF ALL-TIME [/b]
When Half Life originally hit shelves back in 1998, it completely revolutionized the genre. It set a bar that would take years to surpass - the immersive storytelling, the amazing catalog of weapons and foes, all along with a unique blend of genres left many of us wandering just what this new company by the name of Valve could do next...

[i] ...then it came [/i]
JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT COULDN'T GET ANY BETTER, Half-Life 2 dropped, and boy oh boy, what a sequel it was! Half-Life 2 took all the best parts of the first game, developed and expanded on them, and packaged it all up with that driving storyline and characters that you truly felt a connection with unlike any title before. The amazing fast-paced action, a plot that sucks you in and keeps you clicking not just for the addictive gameplay (of which it is *very* hard to put down) but also to find out what happens next. The best show you've seen on TV, your favorite page-turner of a book; the story in this game is [i] just as good [/i] as any of those, if not better. 

I just went back and gave this game a playthrough for the first time in over a decade and just - WOW! I can't believe this thing really lived up to all the great memories, all the nostalgia and wonder at the world Valve had created. Playing through in the modern day its hard to believe the engine itself is almost 20 years old. The game still looks and plays like any modern FPS.

[b] TO SUM IT ALL UP... [/b]
Half-Life 2 changed the course of video games. You should pick this title up and give it a playthrough if for no other reason than to pay respect to the video game that gave rise to titles like GTA, Halo, Call of Duty and more! If you've ever enjoyed an FPS that traded in polished cutscenes for an immersive story that felt like you were playing through a movie, this is the game you have to thank. Even all of these years later, the title holds up like a AAA heavyweight. Whether you've played the game dozens of times before or you're a youngster who's never touched the game before, do yourself a favor: pick up this title and enjoy the next ~20 hours of your life - you're witnessing history."
658,"Dude, you haven't played Half-Life 2?

What is wrong with you???"
659,"As someone playing this game in 2022 I refuse to believe this game was made in 2004, Even by today's standards the graphics, mechanics, and story line is better than most games. It's also a nice relief to play a game that doesn't have any transactions other than purchasing the game itself. 10/10 would recommend."

663,"This is one of the most perfect video games I've ever played. The world-building is fantastic: we're initially thrown into a dystopian, Orwellian future in Europe. Players then journey through what feels like a buffet of exciting moments--from vehicular play, to battling large tripod-like robots, and co-op'ing with well-designed AI (Alyx and sometimes her companion, Dog) through an engaging, and non-invasive storyline.

What I love about all the Half-Life games is that the developers really know how to guide your eyes. A bad guy NPC could alarm you, only for you to see an amazing vista like a helicopter exploding. They're also good at disclosing story information in real time, without using cut-scenes or other typical narrative devices. The gravity gun adds a lot of creativity to an already exciting gameplay. HL2 seems to improve heavily upon what the original already did exceptionally well. 

The optimization is fantastic too. The game has minimal load times, despite showing off some amazing graphics and gameplay. My favorite level is, ""We Don't Go to Ravenholm,"" which is one of the most heart-pounding Zombie-horror sequences I've ever played through. Simply put, the Valve team understands how to make games. I'll be playing this one again."

670,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

It is a classic and should be experienced. The ‚Äòspecial effects‚Äô are not as dazzling now as then, but the strong story of the game makes up for that."

681,"i think i might be at least half way though the game as of writing this (APPROVING) review (11.9 hours played so far)
i am enjoying the nostalgia that this game is giving to me as i use to play the very first Half-Life games when i was a kid... i can tell you that you actually do get your moneys worth even if this is an old game compared to many other newer games you won't find many newer games that give you the value that this one does, its very addictive to just sit and play for up to hours at a time. the game itself is extremely well made and i am always hard pressed to find a game that will keep me interested, but this game really does just that and its a game i do enjoy very much and intend to play to the very end, the achievements this game give you are not stupidly difficult and also not a horrible grind either, a lot of games make you do a boring amount of grinding to get just one single achievement, this game doesn't do that to you but they are quite challenging at the same time which keeps the hunt quite interesting but will not stress you out, (like 42 secret areas give or take) but is fun to explore the game to find them as the maps are AMAZINGLY BUILT. i love how dynamic the MAPS are here you get a bit of everything. (great level design) and the attention to detail is astounding for an old game... you could say it is a BLAST FROM THE PAST and my money was very well spent... i highly recommend this game for anyone who loves FPS games. (it also involves a little parkour but i won't add any spoilers because it would reveal too much) xD

my only pet peeve (negative feelings towards this game) is the followers (NPC's) that eventually accompany you on some of the maps levels can often get in your way and block you from moving through tight spaces... especially when you are fighting xD (this is however just a minor annoyance and should not at all put you off from playing this epic game.

i'm gonna have to give this game an overall rating of (9 out of 10) (90%) (means I LOVE IT DEEPLY) it is an adventure i enjoy and will finish the game all the way though."

686,"This game came out in 2004, I beat it in 2022. Gordon Freeman is an MIT graduate and Jeffery Epstein provided funding for substantial projects that came out of MIT.. Coincidence? I think not."
687,Where to begin with Half-life 2. After the Release of Half-life 6 years prior in 1998 the fans wanted more Half-Life and they released the 2 expansion packs to stall for time to make this game. That's how much they worked on this game. and when it did release it somehow was better than the first Half-Life game. There was more story and characters. When you start this game for the first time you see the G-man welcoming Gordon back to Earth. That alone can prepare people for the game they are about to play.

711,"Episode 3
Dearest Player,

I hope this letter finds you well. I can hear your complaint already, ""Gordon Freeman, we have not heard from you in ages!"" Well, if you care to hear excuses, I have plenty, the greatest of them being I've been in other dimensions and whatnot, unable to reach you by the usual means. This was the case until eighteen months ago, when I experienced a critical change in my circumstances, and was redeposited on these shores. In the time since, I have been able to think occasionally about how best to describe the intervening years, my years of silence. I do first apologize for the wait, and that done, hasten to finally explain (albeit briefly, quickly, and in very little detail) events following those described in my previous letter (referred to herewith as Episode 2).

To begin with, as you may recall from the closing paragraphs of my previous missive, the death of Eli Vance shook us all. The Research & Rebellion team was traumatized, unable to be sure how much of our plan might be compromised, and whether it made any sense to go on at all as we had intended. And yet, once Eli had been buried, we found the strength and courage to regroup. It was the strong belief of his brave daughter, the feisty Alyx Vance, that we should continue on as her father had wished. We had the Arctic coordinates, transmitted by Eli's long-time assistant, Dr. Judith Mossman, which we believed to mark the location of the lost research vessel Borealis. Eli had felt strongly that the Borealis should be destroyed rather than allow it to fall into the hands of the Combine. Others on our team disagreed, believing that the Borealis might hold the secret to the revolution's success. Either way, the arguments were moot until we found the vessel. Therefore, immediately after the service for Dr. Vance, Alyx and I boarded a helicopter and set off for the Arctic; a much larger support team, mainly militia, was to follow by separate transport.

It is still unclear to me exactly what brought down our little aircraft. The following hours spent traversing the frigid waste in a blizzard are also a jumbled blur, ill-remembered and poorly defined. The next thing I clearly recall is our final approach to the coordinates Dr. Mossman has provided, and where we expected to find the Borealis. What we found instead was a complex fortified installation, showing all the hallmarks of sinister Combine technology. It surrounded a large open field of ice. Of the Hypnos itself there was no sign‚Ä¶or not at first. But as we stealthily infiltrated the Combine installation, we noticed a recurent, strangely coherent auroral effect‚Äìas of a vast hologram fading in and out of view. This bizarre phenomenon initially seemed an effect caused by an immense Combine lensing system, Alyx and I soon realized that what we were actually seeing was the research vessel Borealis itself, phasing in and out of existence at the focus of the Combine devices. The aliens had erected their compound to study and seize the ship whenever it materialized. What Dr. Mossman had provided were not coordinates for where the sub was located, but instead for where it was predicted to arrive. The vessel was oscillating in and out of our reality, its pulses were gradually steadying, but there was no guarantee it would settle into place for long‚Äìor at all. We determined that we must put ourselves into position to board it at the instant it became completely physical.

At this point we were briefly detained‚Äìnot captured by the Combine, as we feared at first, but by minions of our former nemesis, the conniving and duplicitous Wallace Breen. Dr. Breen was not as we had last seen him‚Äìwhich is to say, he was not dead. At some point, the Combine had saved out an earlier version of his consciousness, and upon his physical demise, they had imprinted the back-up personality into a biological blank resembling an enormous slug. The BreenGrub, despite occupying a position of relative power in the Combine hierarchy, seemed nervous and frightened of me in particular. Wallace did not know how his previous incarnation, the original Dr. Breen, had died. He knew only that I was responsible. Therefore the slug treated us with great caution. Still, he soon confessed (never able to keep quiet for long) that he was himself a prisoner of the Combine. He took no pleasure from his current grotesque existence, and pleaded with us to end his life. Alyx believed that a quick death was more than Wallace Breen deserved, but for my part, I felt a modicum of pity and compassion. Out of Alyx's sight, I might have done something to hasten the slug's demise before we proceeded.

Not far from where we had been detained by Dr. Breen, we found Judith Mossman being held in a Combine interrogation cell. Things were tense between Judith and Alyx, as might be imagined. Alyx blamed Judith for her father's death‚Ä¶news of which, Judith was devastated to hear for the first time. Judith tried to convince Alyx that she had been a double agent serving the resistance all along, doing only what Eli had asked of her, even though she knew it meant she risked being seen by her peers‚Äìby all of us‚Äìas a traitor. I was convinced; Alyx less so. But from a pragmatic point of view, we depended on Dr. Mossman; for along with the Borealis coordinates, she possessed resonance keys which would be necessary to bring the vessel fully into our plane of existence.

We skirmished with Combine soldiers protecting a Combine research post, then Dr. Mossman attuned the Borealis to precisely the frequencies needed to bring it into (brief) coherence. In the short time available to us, we scrambled aboard the ship, with an unknown number of Combine agents close behind. The ship cohered for only a short time, and then its oscillations resume. It was too late for our own military support, which arrived and joined the Combine forces in battle just as we rebounded between universes, once again unmoored.

What happened next is even harder to explain. Alyx Vance, Dr. Mossman and myself sought control of the ship‚Äìits power source, its control room, its navigation center. The ships's history proved nonlinear. Years before, during the Combine invasion, various members of an earlier science team, working in the hull of a dry-docked vessel situated at the Aperture Science Research Facility in Michigan, had assembled what they called the Bootstrap Device. If it worked as intended, it would emit a field large enough to surround the ship. This field would then itself travel instantaneously to any chosen destination without having to cover the intervening space. There was no need for entry or exit portals, or any other devices; it was entirely self-contained. Unfortunately, the device had never been tested. As the Combine pushed Earth into the Seven Hour War, the aliens seized control of our most important research facilities. The staff of the Borealis, with no other wish than to keep the ship out of Combine hands, acted in desperation. The switched on the field and flung the Borealis toward the most distant destination they could target: Arctica. What they did not realize was that the Bootstrap Device travelled in time as well as space. Nor was it limited to one time or one location. The Borealis, and the moment of its activation, were stretched across space and time, between the nearly forgotten Lake Huron of the Seven Hour War and the present day Arctic; it was pulled taut as an elastic band, vibrating, except where at certain points along its length one could find still points, like the harmonic spots along a vibrating guitar string. One of these harmonics was where we boarded, but the string ran forward and back, in both time and space, and we were soon pulled in every direction ourselves...

728,"Okay, after putting it off for years at a time, I've finally beat Half-Life 2. Before you ask why, let me just say that a lot of this was due to time constraints, but also because this game just didn't pull me in the first few missions like everyone said it would have.

After putting it off for so long, did I feel like it was worth beating? Hell yes I do. Do I feel like it's better than the original Half-Life? God no.

Half-Life 2's ultimate goal vasts far from the concept of the original Half-Life. This isn't a bad thing, but it does leave some departments such as art & story to be quite lacking when you compare the titles together. Though in Half-Life 2's defense, art & story is not the #1 most important thing this game aims for; this game is really meant to show off the technical prowess of the Source Engine. In some chapters you can REALLY tell they were trying to let you know what was new about this engine. While I did enjoy the enhanced & refined gameplay, I really did miss a lot of the color & outstanding narratives Half-Life 1 had.

TL;DR - You should absolutely play this game in your lifetime, but in my opinion HL2 never set the bar higher than where HL1 had it at."
729,"It's a great sequel to Half Life. The graphics look beautiful even today and there's the same well paced exploration - puzzle solving - action sequence loop from the first game.

820,"In my HL1 review I wrote it aged poorly. Thankfully, HL2 aged very well.
Objective improvements from the original:
- Great lighting effects and ambient sound design.
- Headshotting enemies is possible, so they are not as bullet spongy.
- Less aim punch from taking damage, making aiming for headshots easier.
- Fewer jumping puzzles.

Half-Life 2 is the progenitor of many 2000's tropes in FPS games:
- First person storytelling (while HL1 also had this, HL2 perfected it).
- Physics puzzles.
- A Gravity Gun-like weapon.
- Extended vehicle sections.
- Or even ammo crates with infinite ammo.

What HL2 excels at, compared to its brethren, is the immaculate sense of progression which gives you a feeling of being a part of a grand adventure. All setpieces, scripted sequences etc. are not too easy or too hard, and they last exactly as long as they should: not too short to make you starved for more, and not too long to overstay their welcome. Just enough to make you feel satiated and ready for the next one. The pacing is so expertly crafted it seems Valve has it down to a science. Also, the Shotgun and .357 are awesome.

What I don't like much:
- The Poison Headcrabs have too much health and their poison can grind the pacing to a halt, even if it does take only a few seconds for the HEV suit to administer an antidote.
- The parts in e.g. Anticitizen One, where a squad of NPCs is following you. They are frequently blocking narrow passages, which can be annoying.

No wonder people still love HL2 so much. It's just that good."
821,Classic
822,"I first played this game at a weird time in life. Having grown up with a generation of games that were released well after HL2, and took MANY notes, playing it well over a decade after its release was odd. With gunplay that felt lacking in impact, and modelling/texture work that just felt *slightly* subpar to the time, (which is a massive testament to how advanced they were for 2004) I walked away feeling underwhelmed. Coming back to the game, once again almost a decade later, my initial reactions have been completely overridden. Keep in mind that I came back to HL2 using MMOD. With MMOD installed HL2's gunplay is perfect, and most of the issues I had with combat are gone.

       A lot of reviewers online imply that HL2 has been eclipsed by it's own influence on the gaming landscape. I agree with this to an extent. Games like Bioshock, Dead Space, Dishonored, Destroy all Humans, F.E.A.R. TONS of games really ran with the physics sim sandbox after HL2 proved that it could be done. These games pushed Half Life's ideas and in some areas did it better. Now? It feels like the industry doesn't really care about the concept anymore. What should have been turned into a standard, left as a gimmick. We get remakes of these games, sure, but coming back to HL2 feels like a breath of fresh air. Not to fall into the, ""new thing bad/old thing good."" mentality, but playing HL2 again makes me feel like a piece of the world is gone. It also really shows how much these devs cared. People can argue about valve politics all day, but the love that was poured into Half Life 2 was something special."

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far

I had to fall
To lose it all

I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart

865,"I've been chuckin' barrels around and it's very fun, but the barrels do not do much (any?) damage they just make dudes v angry. @valve this could be game of the year, just let me hurt dudes with barrels it's kind of my thing. 10/10"
866,"Historically accurate game.

Based on the Taiping Rebellion.

You play as Charlton Heston."

878,"This is one of the best experience I had from a video game. I was playing through the entire Valve catalogue and enjoyed Half-Life 1, while I admit that it is obtuse at times and unfair at others. Half-Life 2 deserves to be played by everyone, even if they haven't played the first games. 

The difference between the previous games and to the Source Engine is unreal. The graphics and the physics are infinitely better. This game is fun, it has actual good autosaves (removing the need to constantly save and reload), and is really fun."
879,"this game is really cool,it has the people from the cool animation where they go ""it starts with one thing i dont knwo why i doesnt meven matherr how whard ou tyr"" 
clearly inspired by that animation its really awesome and i love it i wish they made more games inspired by animations"
880,GREAT GAMEPLAY SOLID STORY NOT AS GOOD AS ORIGINAL ONE BUT STILL GREAT. FOR 2004 GRAPHICS ARE FANTASTIC
881,REALLY GOOD!

885,"Half Life 2 Physics and environment is amazing specifically on difficult  setting,  Black Mesa the re-engineered version of Half Life 1 is absolutely a must play.  The sound and challenges are at times better than Half Life 2. Best choice is play them all lol Tom"
886,"I was blown away at how realistic this game was. Yes, I know it's 20 years old and the source engine is starting to show it's age, but it was still able to feel real. Also some chapters are just really fun. GG 10/10"
887,This game is the center of attraction
888,"game is good, play it. 99% sure your grandpa could play it."
889,And If You See Dr Breen! Tell Him I Said. FUCK YOU!
890,One of my favourite games of all time. Came back to 100% the achievement now many years later and it still holds up as super fun!
891,"Don't play this game by 2020's standards, you won't enjoy it, there is simple mechanics, crouch jump, walking and running. 
bhopping if you are into that. New games have so much stuff thrown at you 

The only drawback I have for HL2 is the boat section felt a bit too long, and the SMG/Pistol doesn't feel very satisfying to use. The other weapons are great thanks to their repulsiveness and rag-doll physics 

If you never played it, you should.
Great game"
892,"smashed a crowbar through a combine's skull, awesome"
893,Simply the best game ever made
894,achivements
895,gaming
896,"""hah pick up that can am i right guys....guys"""
897,"What else Can i say other than this shit aged Well 
And of course Valve did great Job - story, characters, physics and other stuff are just pure awesome."
898,YES
899,"Played a lot longer than this, but it was earlier on xbox, i saw it was on sale and couldnt resist. brings the nostalga on for sure. love this game to death easily one of my top three would recomend highly"

901,can't sex the alyx :(
902,gman sourcer engine (not clickbait) (gone crazy)
903,Still looks amazing for an 18 year old game. Id recommend you buy the orange box though.
904,love the hell outta this title
905,I liked Half life and Half- Life 2. I think the Half-life series it is hard to find all the ins and out of the game.
906,now this is half life
907,"As much as they are hated on I do not agree with the excessive hate on the New Super Mario Bros. series while personally I think the first game isn't that great and the second isn't all too original I still believe they are good games. New Super Mario Bros. Wii on the other hand I think is a great game with lots of unique concepts, while not being anything super different from its predecessor it is overall a better experience with more unique levels that the game doesn't lock behind secret exits in castles and a greater use for star coins in the ninth world of the game, which despite the tediousness of entry to the levels they provide a good challenge. New Super Mario Bros U and New Super Luigi U are just a better version of the Wii game seeming very similar on the surface but with a better world map and level design. New Super Luigi U Has a great challenge due to the new physics which makes the game fun and satisfying to complete. Overall I think they get too much hate for how much better they are even compared to the older NES and SNES games."
908,"Game is good
"
909,Coolio
910,nostalgia
911,gorndon fremna
912,Yes
913,It's as good and immersive as a single player game gets.  Great narrative.  About to start another playthrough (again) years after I first played.
914,"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries."
915,"Valve does it again. Another masterpiece!

Obvious that Valve improved upon creating Half-Life. The path is always clear, the game yells at you where to go, but you don't notice, which makes it very enjoyable. The usage of Source's physics engine in different puzzles and other places is always very fun (except when they get janky (love you source)). The narrative of the whole story makes you feel like you really take part of it!

Another game added to my list of favorites!"
916,yyyyuy
917,"gaben pls
where half life 3?"
918,"rise and boof... mr freeman
rise.. and boof"
919,"""They don't make games like this these days"" is the sentiment I have when replaying this game.
It is a game you must have played at some point, and it aged well.

If they would only get around of making HL3 someday, I would be ecstatic."
920,Half-Life 2 Is a Masterpiece!
921,epic pew pew game 2
922,"Even Though I'm Late to the party And Played it in 2020. I Still Had Fun and Played Multiple Times. Highly Recommend 
"
923,"Praies gabe n
"
924,"Fun, Hard, and a over all awesome game. Beware of Ravenholm. The headcrabs will scare you if you are scared of spiders. But that makes it more fun! 9.5/10"
925,"Half life 2 is a big piece of videogame history and without a doubt one of the most important pc games to ever come out.
I didnt play half life 2 when it came out, i got to it later due to hearing how good it was supposed to be and even tho i was spoiled to the extend with better graphics and more modern gameplay from other games this still was one of the best experiences Ive ever had in any game.
for its time it was an amazing and outstanding piece of art and even a elevation from the technic they had these days and even today it can hold up against many many modern games, not even mentioning how many important games only exist because of this game, 
Counter strike, portal, probably most shooter games we have today, Gmod, team fortress, all these games and many more wouldnt exist today without half life (2).

the impact this game had on both gaming and the entire internet history is immense and even if you dont like shooter games, this is a must play even to just educate yourself to the origin of many things we might view as normal today, same goes to half life 1.
the half life story is complex and its themes and topics are implemented incredibly well even to todays standarts, i dont want to spoiler anyone about the story but just know its amazing.
the half life community, or in general the source engine community also is one of the best communities to be in, many many talented people, many nice people, many helpfull people.

its a must play."
926,"It starts with

928,pretty good game
929,So much fun i legit just played 9 hours without stopping and thought i was playing for a few hours so rare and so wild hasn't happened in a very long time.
930,"There's just something really enjoyable about fighting off feral zombies that sprint towards you at alarming speed and antlions spawning out of nowhere threatening to rip you apart limb by limb. [spoiler] until you become the Antlion Whisperer and they do your every bidding while you wave your balls at them enticingly [/spoiler]

And by enjoyable, I mean the facial expression in my pfp. But also enjoyable in a normal way, too. Equal parts :)"
931,"If you haven't tried HL1 or HL2 yet then I don't know what you've been doing these years. If you've never heard or seen any of these games (which I doubt), I'd highly recommend trying both of them out, it is 100% worth your money and time. Personally I've never got interested in the Half Life series and games, but one of my friends told me that its a must play, so I said ""Why not?"" and gave it a try, and me knowing that the first Half Life game had such a big impact to shooters and games in general I got even more interested. So I decided on buying HL1 first, man, what an experience that was, I've never played any game like that before, I liked it so much that I immediately got interested in its sequel Half Life 2 and well what can I say, I loved it even more than the first one. Now that I finished both there's still some more Half Life games I need to check out; well this concludes my review. I am off to continue my Half Life journey..."

 (about 10h to finish the game)"
944,gorinf fgreeman
945,"Half Life 2 serves as a new story in the universe of the original Half Life, where the direct results of the events in Black Mesa become very tangible. Going from a major mishap in the underground laboratory to an Orwellian civilization lead by the alien invaders.

It's hard to imagine that this game came out in 2004. It was ahead of its time for sure, as was the original Half Life. Maybe it's the Source engine that makes these games feel more fluent, responsive and modern. Even though we're almost 20 years further, you can always pick this game up or come back to it."
946,"id gude

947,"For an old game, this game is still great"
948,hunt down the freeman was better then this [joke]
949,"i mean what is there to say amazing everything gameplay ,  story , gunplay , characters just play it"
950,runs well on my  grandmothers pc
951,"It's one of Steam's classics. It's the definitive Valve experience, not sure what else to say. Great game."
952,Really fun game
953,"I can say that it is one of the revolutions in the history of the game.
It was an excellent sci-fi story. The characters are beautiful and deeply detailed. You can feel the emotions of the characters while playing the game. The chapters and maps are all very well detailed, in my opinion, at a higher level than the year. The thing I felt the most while playing Half life 2 was how invasive the combined race was. In the game, the waters of the world have been drained, the animals have disappeared, the forests of the barren world have disappeared, and I think this shows the damage that an invasive species can do to the world in the best way in the game. Developing the game with the game engine is a big job and it has been done very well. But in some places in the game, physics can get you crazy, for example, keep of the sand! I struggled a lot while earning the achievement and I came to the point of going crazy :).
In short, I think it is one of the best games in the game universe that everyone should play and finish.
Rƒ∞SE AND SHƒ∞NE MR. FREEMAN!"

971,"so, remind me why this game became popular again?
it takes survival-like mechanics from titles like rust and its basically a ripoff of fallouts story, the graphics are suuuper bad also, DO NOT PLAY!!! I suggest playing a good game like hunt down the freeman"
972,Makes me itchy
973,No tau cannon its shit. Direct downgrade from the original.
974,"Absolute masterpiece. Half life was a great game, and this somehow topped it. One of my favorites for sure. Feeling a little sad I've played through all it has to offer, hoping half life 3 comes soon."

980,"One of the best games ever made. Didn't like the ending. Makes you feel like a piece of crap that someone else does everything he wants with. Also, the ending of episode 2 is horrible. Someone tell guys at Valve that here, on planet Earth, the human beings like things to end well, to enjoy their success. After fighting through the whole game, instead of feeling good, the game makes you very sad and ends. I hope they fired the weirdo who wrote such a horrible ending."

992,i do not own this game please do not mistake me for a fan
993,"A very good game!

Half-Life 2 was a pretty big deal when it first released and boy does it deserve all of the praise it gets!

The gameplay is interesting and the world around you is constantly changing. You aren't stuck in one location for the games duration. The way you fight enemy is varied aswell. You may find 4 enemys on a bridge with explosives underneath it. you can either shoot them one by one or shoot the explosives underneath said bridge and kill them all. The world around you feels responsive and that is something that not a lot of games do nowadays.

The Writing is also top notch and is by far the best I have ever seen in a video game. there were many points in the game where I found myself laughing and genuinely believing the events that were happening.

However, the game does have It's flaws.
I found that the game was a little to short and the ending didn't feel too fleshed out. There are some graphical elements that didn't age too well and if get neausia easily than this game might not be for you

To sum it up, this was a great game in 2004, and still is now so long that you look at it through a 2004 lens and not a 2022 one."
994,Solid 9/10 even in 2022.
995,"The last generation of mankind is given a choice. To live in slavery or to fight and die free.

A post-soviet atmosphere so familiar to Eastern Europeans. A reference to the USSR and the totalitarian society inspired by the novel ¬´1984¬ª."

1012,"An important classic.  Plays well and looks great, even 20 years later"
1013,"Lots of variety, well paced and challenging"
1014,"I think it's time I talk about this game. Because I don't really love or hate this game. It's a really good game, but I don't like it as much as the first one. I love the cool stuff that made computers from 2004 melt, but I guess this game just doesn't click with me the same way HL1 did. I guess for comparison's sake, it's like having me choose between smash ultimate and smash melee. Like, yeah smash ultimate is a great game that adds so much to the series, but there's something about melee that has a charm to it. In short, the game is far from something that I'd say is bad. In fact, a lot of it is really good and holds up well to today. The water and physics are glorious for '04, and the gameplay and setting are great. I think the problem for me is the weapons. Half-Life 2 cut out some of my favorite weapons (Tau Cannon/Gauss Gun and Snarks), and then nerfed the ones I enjoyed in the first (Shotgun, Handgun in slot 2, and Crossbow). I get that HL2 and HL1 play differently from each other, and are pretty much different games, but I just kinda wish the weapons that made it from 1 to 2 weren't changed. Still a fun romp, 8/10."
1015,"Half life 2 is a fun game if you have not played it i suggest you do i had a hole hell of alot of fun playing this the nice things about this game are grapics have aged well gun play could be a little better but its not bad and has a great story/lore 

only thing that i dont like is, the middle of the game i felt like i was kinda boring"

1020,"Summary
The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hit points, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks.
The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a Mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring.
His ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider.
Hog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings.
Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby.

Strategy
Offensive
He can be used to jump over any level Walls, rendering them ineffective against Hog Riders. Note that while this allows Hog Riders free access to what lies behind the Walls, it does not open up gaps for other troops to move through. If the Hog Riders need the support of other ground troops, you will still need to deploy Wall Breakers, a Jump Spell, or Earthquake Spells in order to assist them.
Hog Riders can be used en masse, i.e. a ""Hog Rider Rush"", without requiring any Wall Breakers to break Walls. However, such a strategy sports weaknesses against defending Clan Castle troops, Heroes, Giant Bombs, and Skeleton Traps, a problem which only becomes more prominent at higher levels.
At Town Hall 10 and above, Hog Riders can be combined with Miners in a strategy known as Hog Miner or Hybrid. Both troops are able to bypass Walls innately, but Miners do not have a preferential target, allowing them to cover for Hog Riders by dealing with defending Heroes and Skeleton Traps. The combination also has weaknesses against flying Clan Castle troops, as neither are able to target air.
At lower levels, Hog Riders are quite capable of acting as distracting troops like Giants; they have nearly as much health as a similar-level Giant, move twice as fast, and do considerably more damage.
They work well with the Healing Spell when you group several of them together.
A good tactic for using Healing Spells is to place them strategically on a cluster of defenses (at least about 3 or more) and also deploy them shortly before the Hog Riders arrive in the area, deploy them in front of the Hog Riders. This is so that the Hog Riders get the most value out of the Healing Spell, and destroy the defenses without losing too much HP.
Spots where Giant Bombs or Bomb Towers are/may be should be given special attention when deploying Healing Spells. Hogs of the same level as the Giant Bomb will survive a single Giant Bomb, but they're helpless against a pair of Giant Bombs even with a Healing Spell. Heal them after they've gone through a Giant Bomb blast.
The Hog Rider is one of the best troop types for drawing out Clan Castle troops, as it can avoid Walls to penetrate deep enough to reach centrally-placed Clan Castles (and enough health to not die before it gets there). Deploy one or a few to trigger the Clan Castle troops, then lure the reinforcement troops to the corner side, and deploy multiple Archers or Wizards to slaughter them, and then deploy the remainder of your Hog Riders. This strategy is especially effective during Clan War raids. However, Skeletons from the Skeleton Trap and Heroes can also easily kill the Hog Riders, as they can only target defenses, so make sure to have some troops that target anything, such as Wizards, which can swipe out the Skeletons.
Hog Riders don't target air so flying Clan Castle troops, especially Dragons, can be a big threat. Most mass Hog Rider strategies in Clan Wars require that the Clan Castle troops be killed first by luring. Bring other troops in addition to Hog Riders, such as Wizards, to deal with enemy Clan Castle troops and clean up the base.
Poison Spells can be used to kill almost any enemy Clan Castle troop, but beware as the troops will attempt to flee the poison. If the Poison Spells are decently leveled, and you effectively keep the Clan Castle troops from escaping the Poison Spell with distracting troops, they can eliminate almost any troop. They can also be used to dispense of those pesky Skeletons risen from the Skeleton Traps.
Time is also a factor to consider. With only 3 minutes in an attack, it is essential to make sure that this whole process and the remainder of the attack is done as quickly as possible to avoid running out of time.
Defensive
Defending against Hog Riders is tricky, as their ability to bypass Walls renders them irrelevant. However, the fact that they can jump over Walls and attack defenses means that they may leave behind their ground support (such as Barbarians, etc.), as they will not be able to follow. This will allow your interior defenses to concentrate on the Hog Riders.
Another way to defend against Hog Riders is to exploit the fact that they will attack the closest defensive building. You can arrange your base in such a way so that you have high-powered defenses on the inside and lower-powered defense on the outside, with a layer of resources in between. That way, the Hogs will (in theory) complete a loop around your base before being able to attack your interior defenses (Inferno Towers, X-Bows, etc.), by which time they should have all been killed by the interior defenses.
You can place Spring Traps and Giant Bombs in between defensive buildings to take out a few Hog Riders at a time; good usage of multiple Spring Traps and Giant Bombs can severely hinder a Hog Rider rush.
Hog Riders can be easily killed using ""forced pathing"". Forced pathing is a strategy that manipulates the Hog Rider AI and makes them go to at least 2 defenses that cannot be prevented by surgical dropping or side clearing. Placing a set of Giant Bombs in between the two can most certainly hinder the attacker progress. They would not be able to heal the Hog Riders in time.
Clan Castle troops, Heroes, and Skeleton Traps set to Ground Mode can be an annoyance to mass Hog Rider raids, as Hog Riders will not attack them unless all defenses have been destroyed. Make sure to centralize them if you want to beat Hog Riders.
In Clan Wars, Dragons are excellent troops to place in Clan Castles against Hog Riders, especially for Town Halls 8 and 9. They have high HP, meaning they won't die easily and can kill mass quantities of Hog Riders swiftly if not properly lured. Most mass Hog Rider strategies require that the enemy Clan Castle troops be killed first, so if the attacker lures out a Dragon, but fails to kill it, then a 3-star win is next to impossible, much less a 1-star win via destroying 50% of the buildings.
Multi-target Inferno Towers can be a severe hindrance to Hog Riders, having high HP to take several hits from Hog Riders, while hitting large groups of them.
Although the Hog Rider is certainly not a liability on defense, the fact that all defensive troops are unimpeded by Walls negates the primary advantage of the Hog Rider. Still, for the space they take they are faster and more damaging comp"

1022,Good game
1023,mr freeman

1025,Cult!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1026,An all time classic.
1027,"great game, i fucking hate how weak the guns feel and sound, little diversity in combine enemies 
9.5/1O"
1028,"This game has not held up well at all to be honest. Half-Life 2 just feels inferior in almost every way to Half-Life 1 except in the story. 

Combat always feels like a chore instead of an fun encounter due to the small enemy pool that mostly consists of just combine and a tiny amount of aliens, you would think the special combine units (I.e the Hunter chopper, gunnerships and striders) would add some variety to the combat, but not really. They're almost always trivialised in some way: The hunter chopper gets destroyed by the airboat's mini-gun, gunships are placed in areas with infinite rocket resupplies and striders share the same issue with the gunnerships. So that the main enemy you'll be fighting is the combine soldiers usually, this would be alright but they're A.I is not all that good, opting just to rush at you instead of being somewhat strategic with grenades and cover. Lastly the alien enemies are just way too easy, headcrabs and antlions are so weak they don't even matter that much and the zombies are really only placed in two chapter which is We don't go to ravenholm and Highway 17. 

The chapters themselves are a mixed bag for me, on one hand they can be really good like Nova Prospekt and they manage to make the Combine soldiers into pretty dangerous foes with their placements. But then there's chapters like Highway 17, which has boring, empty wastelands with very little difficult combat encounters, constant driving, an overstayed welcome and a boring climax. 

The focus on the physics of the game kinda kills some of the chapters for me as well. I guess a good example of this is We don't go to ravenholm, which has you using the Gravity gun for most of it because all lot of the encounters are entirely designed around it. It makes it feel more like a showcase rather than actual gameplay for me, kinda like the tram sequence in half-life 1. Cool the first time, kinda neat the second time and an absolute snore fest on the 3rd playthrough. 

I don't have too many comments on the story and characters. The story is really compelling in parts which motivates you to move forward with the game, and the characters are memorable, likeable and most importantly, intresting. 

Overall, Half-Life 2 has really shown it's cracks over the years and has very little replay value, but it's alright on it's first playthrough and the episodes provide some form of substitute for the lack of replayability. But if you want to play it my advice is just to pick it up on deal."
1029,"got stuck rage quit

1030,Really fun and good game
1031,apply physics to solve a problem: the terran superorganism being slowly eaten alive by a predatory superorganism
1032,"While I think some parts of the game could have been cut (especially stuff in the later city sections) as they drag on, overall this game still holds up.  I played it back a few years after release, since I managed to build a nice PC and bought the Orange Box (physically! lol).  Granted most people would probably want to play Half-Life 2 Update, I always wanted to go back and finish this game, especially the achievements, since they apparently didn't exist back when I played the title.  I actually remember arguing with a mentee about which game was better, HL2 or RE4; he said HL2, I said RE4.  I'd still probably pick RE4, but I will say the kid had good taste.  If you're playing this on good enough hardware, enabling HBAO+ and SGSSAA will really make the game pop, as will the 4x AI upsampled textures.  I ran all that on a 2060 at 1440p quite well, between 80 and 130fps, generally the latter.  If you've never played the game, you probably won't notice the gameplay or story dragging, but it can suffer on replays, unfortunately."

1055,"Ultimate Legend. One of the Best Games Ever Made.

Ancestor of the Most Anticipated game in the world. Are you still waiting for Half Life 3? (‚ùÅ¬¥‚ó°`‚ùÅ)

This game is a Masterpiece of Valve and Victor Antonov.

While it's quite old already (even for a ""30-year boy"" like me) it is still great.
Yes, the graphics is outdated, but don't let it scare you off.

Immercive Orwell 1984-like environment, unprecedented eye for detail and a perfect gameplay balance between shooter/action/puzzles and horror - everything in this game is made with true passion.

I would also like to note that at the moment of it's release (2004) this game was very progressive: live physics, interactive environment, physics based puzzles, advanced face motion, soft body physics, ragdolls, HDR and many other things.
Today these things are common for any AAA-project, but at the time when Half Life 2 release it wasn't that way...

Conclusion:
This game was made by a team of industry leading professionals with a true passion for the product they were creating.
This is a truly rare example of 'how games are meant to be made'. A relic. Don't miss it.

1114,"The Miner card is unlocked from the P.E.K.K.A.'s Playhouse (Arena 4) or a Legendary Chest. He is a single-target, melee troop with both moderate hitpoints and damage that can be placed anywhere in the arena. He wears a dark grey helmet with a partially melted candle on top, carries a shovel, and has a large reddish nose and a slightly dirtied face. A Miner card costs 3 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy Due to his ability to be placed anywhere, the Miner can be used for surprise attacks on towers and troops. He deals only 30% of his normal damage to Crown Towers, so it is generally not recommended to use him on them alone. He can act as a surprise tank for high damage per second troops such as Wall Breakers. Spear Goblins or Minions, which is a cheap way to deal immense damage if ignored by the opponent. The Miner will tank the damage from the Tower or other troops while the supporting units deal chip damage. This combo can be countered by swarm troops or spells, however. A lone Miner can deal similar damage to a Rocket for half the price to a Crown Tower if ignored, so it is generally advised to address him whenever possible and reduce the damage he deals with each push. However, if one is using a high Elixir cost deck, it may be worth ignoring a lone Miner that is used to punish one's Elixir investment, so that they have more Elixir to create a large, unstoppable push. Compared to other 3 Elixir cards, he does not deal very much damage to a Crown Tower. The Electro Wizard works well with the Miner on offense. After the tower locks onto the Electro Wizard, a Miner can be sent in to tank for it when. The Electro Wizard's stun attacks will cause the tower to retarget onto the Miner, allowing the Electro Wizard to survive longer and deal more damage. You can also do this with the Zappies. If the player is sending the Miner to a Princess Tower, sending the Miner on the center tile of the inner side will allow the other Princess Tower to target him. This can be helpful in that the Miner is distracting both Princess Towers, so the player can send in fast backup troops to attack both lanes. However, if the Miner is being sent in alone, it is generally not recommended to deploy him here as he will simply die more quickly and deal less damage. On the contrary, due to this interaction, this placement is very effective when one only needs a few Miner hits to take down the tower, as many players will not expect this ""self-destructive"" placement. If the player deploys him in front of the tower, their supporting units are much easier to counter as splash units can easily splash the Miner and support troops. An Ice Golem can also be placed in front of tower pushing the Miner and forcing him to re-target. Due to this, it is not recommended to deploy him here, even as a surprise attack, as a unit placed far enough forward can take care of both the Miner and incoming support troops. If one wishes to attack the King's Tower without their Miner being within range of a Princess Tower, they should place the Miner on the left corner or 1 tile beside said corner of the King's Tower to avoid getting targeted by the right Princess Tower, and vice versa. Conversely, if one wishes to attack a Princess Tower without getting targeted by the King's Tower, place him in the bottom right corner of the right Princess Tower so that he can target it without getting targeted by the King's Tower, and vice versa. If the opponent has the Tornado card in their deck, they are able to drag the Miner to their King's Tower against many common placements, causing a King activation for an equal Elixir trade and very little Princess Tower damage. One should be aware of the two safe spots in which a Miner cannot be dragged to the King's Tower by the Tornado, those being the bottom-most tile on the non-King Tower side and the tile directly above that. Although a Miner is safe in these positions, this makes its attacks very predictable and easy to block with units as soon as the Miner is seen approaching. One may want to consider intentionally placing the Miner in a Tornado-vulnerable position and supporting him with fast, high damage units like Goblins or Bats. If the opponent is low on Elixir, they will take major damage from the supporting units should they decide to activate their King's Tower (more than they would have if they simply ignored the Miner and addressed the supporting units). Miners can destroy enemy buildings such as spawners when they are not attacking or defending, as his damage is only reduced to Crown Towers, and will deal normal damage to other buildings. An Elixir Collector is also particularly vulnerable to Miner attacks, potentially allowing for large positive Elixir trades. However, it is important to note that most players will attempt to protect any passive buildings placed in the back from Miner damage. Single units placed behind the Princess Tower can ""catch"" most Miner placements provided the defender reacts quickly enough. Cheap swarms are more lenient on this timing as they can spread out. One should either wait for the opponent's blocking unit to be out of their hand, or if the opponent uses swarms to defend him, use a spell alongside the Miner on reaction. Another strategy is to feign an attack on the building (i.e. aiming for the Princess Tower instead) in order to make the opponent waste Elixir, which can allowing for spell value on their unit, the Princess Tower, and the building. If the opponent places their building beside their King's Tower, a high-risk, high-reward play is to send the Miner towards the back of the building, rather than the front or side. This is risky because if the opponent ignores it, the Miner will activate their King's Tower after destroying the building (which is still a positive Elixir trade, but will notably limit future Miner damage). However, if the opponent plays a card to defend a Miner in front or beside the building, the unit will waste time walking towards him and defeat him before he can get a chance to activate the King's Tower, which also results in an even larger positive Elixir trade as the opponent will have spent Elixir to deploy a unit, and would have lost the opportunity to activate the King's Tower. The Miner should not be deployed directly above and 1 tile beside on the left (for both sides of the arena) of the Princess Tower as he will target it instead. The Miner will always attack the left corner of the targeted building. The Tombstone is the only passive building which is not recommended to be taken down with a Miner under any circumstance. The constant Skeleton spawns make it difficult for the Miner to connect to it, and its equal Elixir cost and death spawn will deny all Miner damage even if the Miner does connect. In fact, a Tombstone is typically only placed behind a Princess Tower specifically in anticipation for Miner attacks. It's not recommended to reel the Miner to the King's Tower with a Tornado when the Miner is at low health, as the Miner can possibly die during the spell effect, resulting in a waste of three Elixir. When Mirroring a Miner, the Mirror will reveal its location. Due to this, it is not recommended to Mirror a Miner when using it on offense, as the Mirror's visual indicator will make it easier to block with a troop. The player can also support their pushes by deploying the Miner next to their troops. However, the Miner is best used to tank, diverting some damage from the main push. The Miner can be used to take early-placed opposing defenders by surprise. That way, Miner can tank for the player's main offense. The Miner can take out squishy but powerful troops such as the Princess or Musketeer that are protected by a tank. Against a Princess that is attacking a tower from the bridge, placing him on the outside tiles will not cause her to re-target to him; the player needs to deploy the Miner on the inside or the center tile to cause her to re-target. Being a single-target troop, the Miner is"

1225,"this game and the episodes are some of the best story in any videogame. PLUS the game immerses you into the story and it feels very realized. valve's style of storytelling in this game is still amazing 18 years later. there is more gameplay variety than Half Life 1, but the combat is kind of a step down. the guns just straight up don't feel that good, and the non-alien combat by itself is kinda boring. The puzzles and the gravity gun 1000% make up for that though. This was a revolutionary game in its storytelling, game design, and technology, more than the original.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Not to mention it's the perfect length, 15 hours of varied, unique game-play and shooting with the game constantly switching things up to hold your attention, no Xen here. Highly recommend this game for any fan of Bioshock, Half-Life 1, or shooters in general, console or PC."

But in the end it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter"

1336,"What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? You know the story is one of the best the FPS genre has to offer, you know the gameplay is inventive, fluent and challenging enough to keep you engaged but not so difficult that is becomes frustrating, you know the level design raised the industry standard, you know that you don‚Äôt have to play the first game to understand this one and you know that the game is dirt cheap. So I ask you, why don‚Äôt you just buy the game?"

1345,simply perfect
1346,"I'm surprised it's taken me this long to review Half-Life 2.  Basically, if you liked the original Half-Life, you'll like this.  Gameplay is similar, but with more advanced physics for its time.  The story is a continuation of the original Half-Life and the end, like the original, leaves you with more questions.  Pretty much every character is likeable and you meet a cool new friend at the beginning who sometimes supports you in battle.  I can think of about 4 weapons from the original that have been replaced with 4 new, different ones.  There are several enemies from the original that do not make an appearance here, but there are also several new, different ones.  None of the changes, in my opinion, make a negative impact on the game.

Now, considering this game by itself, it's really fun.  Lots of physics to play around with, lots of fighting, cool levels and good progression.  You wouldn't regret starting the Half-Life franchise here, but the references from the original would be lost on you, of course.

Then, there are the mods.  There are lots of fun mods out there for this game.  Some of my favorites are, in no particular order, MMod, Underhell, Nightmare House (1 & 2), Black Mesa, Grey and Cry of Fear.

Give it a shot.  I'm sure you'll have fun with this."

1352,"Dr. Gordon Freeman is one of the great heroes of our time. Regardless of being a man of science, he is also a man of action; words do not become him. The liminal spaces the environment consists of fascinate the mind to no end."
1353,I sold drugs to a headcrab
1354,"One of Valve's Flagships.  Hands down.  If you 'call' yourself a gamer, and haven't played this game, and all facets of it; you need to rethink your 'gamer' label.. straight up..."
1355,Your life will feel half as good once you've completed this. WHERE'S MY HALF-LIFE 3?!?!?!?!?!?!

1358,"HALF-LIFE 2

 This game is what i can only describe as:
Timeless.

No matter what Year, month, week or day this game will always stand as the game that inspired so many people.
This game is peoples childhoods.
In every aspect of this game its a thrilling experience.

Engaging STORY.
Breathtaking graphics for a 2004 game. (Other games at this time looked like San Andreas.)
Immersive world.
Gameplay is top notch.
Makes FULL USE of its physics engine.

Now, lets gush over the real thing i love about this game.

The Combine.

The combine stood out to me as nothing id ever seen before.
Instead of your typical scifi-alien race who destroy worlds;
The combine is different.
They ENSLAVE.
They COMBINE.
The combine take other aliens and COMBINE them into itself. One single being.
Earth is but another planet and species they can enslave to do their bidding.
Most creatures the combine have enslaved have an AMAZING design.

Strider. Tall, three legged, menace.
Gunship. Flying shooting nightmare.

The way the combine have enslaved humanity is interesting too.
Starve the residents of earth.
Turn them into mindless synthetic monsters with no free will.
Drain earths resources until its an empty, dead husk.

The beta version of half-life 2 shows this aspect glorified to its FULLEST.
The beta always intrigued me to the combines ways.

I could go ON AND ON about how MUCH i love this game.
But every other review before me has said it all in detail.
So, im going to just say it.

Half-life 2 will never be forgotten.

And i know that there will NEVER be another game as wonderful, inspiring, and creative as:

                                        
                                                     H Œª L F  -  L I F E  ¬≤

Thank you, Valve."

1368,What can i say that wasn't said earlier. this game is older than 90% of all of you and it still manages to be better that modern FPS games.
1369,Remains a timeless classic!
1370,"i love this game but valve has failed as a developer, they went from a juggernaut, to sitting on their office chairs and basking in the money steam produces. They know they don't have to make a new game, so they don't, no TF2 updates, no half life episode 3, no more valve."

1373,two and a half lives
1374,"Maybe the second best game i have ever played! And HL is in my top 3 favourite gaming franchises. I really like the story and enemies and weapons and level design and everything in the game! I did rage a lot, but i enjoyed. I recommend this to everyone! Valve, thank you for this amazing masterpiece!"

1382,It's a really great game! Made in 2004. Looks like it was made in 2017 not going to lie
1383,Sick game. But the explosion at the end could be better. None or the less big respect to valve
1384,"Mr. Freeman, why so quiet?"
1385,Amazing
1386,i had two problems with with half life but this fixes both and adds fifty new things that surpass anything i think valve will ever do.So with that said uh spend the 10.81 just do it now.
1387,wake up mr freeman
1388,"Doesn't really hold up anymore, I forgot how overrated and safe Valve made the sequel. The open world sections with the boat, and buggy are just straight up awful. It's a fun experience for what it is, but don't expect a masterpiece like HL1. The final sections of the game were so obviously rushed too, and the ending is still as bad as it was in 2004."

1394,"It starts with
One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

Pushed as far as I can go

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard and got so far
