4,"my favourite all time, playing from last 15 years. Addicted yet."
5,The game is good however the game was released at a bad time. This game was released 8 months before Counter Strike Source. Also the game is similar but I like some of the new stuff
6,"Following its predecessor Counter Strike, and some differences such as:
1. Multiplayer bots with their difficulties variants.
2. That so-called ""Story"" missions.

I am truly amazed with this game and have played it since 2011 really recommended this game. Especially when it comes to different varieties of bots. Have fun with some matches with their expert bots."
7,"CS:CZDS is okay.

CS:CZ is the definition of unfairness. I tend to come back to it from time to time and rage quit after hard & expert missions are unlocked. Some of the challenges are ridiculous."

21,This is my favorite counter-strike game I would HIGHLY recommend this game as its a straight upgrade to normal counter-strike and easier to learn than CS-GO and the Tour of Duty gamemode is incredibly fun to play and practice playing in multiple scenarios valve did well on this great game!
22,"When Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was first announced three years ago, it seemed like a decent enough idea. The definitive first-person shooter mod was at the height of its popularity, so having a single-player game based on the winning formula sounded like a good way to win a new following and perhaps entice even more people to venture online. However, those who have been reading up on the game over the years know that development has been a bumpy ride. The duty of making Condition Zero has practically been passed around more than the collection basket at Easter Mass. What started internally at Valve Software quickly moved to Gearbox, then to Ritual Entertainment, and finally over to Turtle Rock Studios. Given such an unusual development path, Condition Zero is surprisingly enjoyable, thanks mostly to some remarkable artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, the game will be remembered as a victim of its own delays.

By now, most FPS fans at least know what Counter-Strike is and have likely played it or have seen it. For those of you who have recently been paroled from a lengthy incarceration or have awakened from a coma, Counter-Strike is a team-based tactical shooter that pits terrorists versus counterterrorists in round-based match play. In the game's current incarnation, there are two game types--bombing and hostage rescue. Bombing maps require the terrorist team to plant and detonate a time bomb in one of two bombing areas while the counterterrorists guard these sites. Hostage rescue involves having the terrorists guard computer-controlled civilians while the counterterrorists try to rescue them. In practice, both game types often result in one team or the other being eliminated in bloody, fast shoot-outs.

Players earn money based on their performances in the previous rounds, and with this money, they can buy weapons at the beginning of each subsequent round (and those who survive the last round keep their guns). The game's arsenal is based on real-life weapons, including Desert Eagle pistols, pump-action shotguns, AK-47 assault rifles, and even some exotic equipment, like tactical shields that deflect bullets.

Single-player Condition Zero is just like the multiplayer version of Counter-Strike that's been played for years, only your teammates and the enemies are replaced by computer-controlled bots. You assume the role of the commander of a counterterrorist force, and you choose your teammates from a menu of named bots. The bots vary in skill, aggressiveness, choice of weapon, and tendency to cooperate with the rest of the team. Those with greater skill and more-powerful weapons cost more points to hire, but you'll earn points steadily as you make your way through the game's campaign.

The campaign is divided into six ""tours of duty,"" each of which consists of three maps, thus offering you a total of 18 maps for gameplay. Most of the maps are drawn from Counter-Strike's classic collection, so veterans will be familiar with classics such as Dust, Aztec, and Italy. Some of the maps have been tweaked greatly, however. For example, Militia is now vastly different from the map longtime CS players are familiar with. The above-land approach from the counterterrorist spawn area to the house has been shortened and adorned with additional rocks to hide behind, thus making life more difficult for terrorist snipers. A handful of new maps have also been included, like Stadium, a multilevel demolitions map that features a lot of narrow hallways and stairwells. Fastline should also be new to PC players, since it was borrowed from the Xbox version of Counter-Strike. It's a very small bombing map, set in a Tokyo subway, that encourages quick rounds and a frenetic pace.

Beating each map requires you to win at least three rounds against the terrorists, and you must be ahead of the terrorists by at least two successive wins while also completing a number of special challenges. These challenges usually involve getting a certain total number of kills, getting kills with a specific weapon, rescuing hostages, and/or winning a round under a certain amount of time. You don't have to complete all these challenges within the three rounds, so if you're beating the terrorists 3-1 and still have a challenge left unfulfilled, the match will continue until you've satisfied all the requirements.

The challenges vary with the difficulty level, as does the rate at which the terrorist team ramps up in skill and number. At the easiest difficulty level, you'll have few prerequisites, and the ones that are there are simple to accomplish. At the expert difficulty level, however, you'll be asked to perform some particularly tough feats, such as getting a knife kill and surviving the same round. For veterans of CS, the normal difficulty level won't be much of a challenge, but the two higher difficulty levels offer some pretty decent challenges, thanks to the surprisingly good bot AI.

The bot AI in most first-person shooters is laughably bad. Counter-Strike provides even more challenges for programmers who are attempting to design capable bots because of the relatively complex tasks these bots must perform. At any rate, we were pleasantly surprised by how clever the bots on both sides were in Condition Zero. Teammates communicate with you constantly by voice by telling you where they are, what they're doing, and if they've spotted an enemy. If the bomb carrier falls, bot CTs know to camp the dropped bomb, and the remaining terrorists are aware that they need to pick up the bomb to complete the mission. Terrorists on hostage rescue maps know that once a certain amount of time has elapsed, patrolling or camping hostage rescue points is an important strategy. They'll also plant bombs behind boxes and other defensible positions. All the bots seem to be programmed to know each map intimately and will crouch on top of good spots or will lie in wait behind strategic corners, just like an experienced human player would. Even more remarkable is that you'll see bots breaking windows and jumping down from high ledges to purposely reach other areas more quickly--even at the expense of incurring a bit of falling damage.

The bots aren't infallible, though. Occasionally you'll spot one getting hung up temporarily on some geometry. We've also seen the terrorist bots abandon planted bombs, thus allowing CTs to sneak in and defuse them without a fight. To be fair, we've also seen many human players make the same boneheaded mistakes over the years. Overall, the bots are remarkably human--and varied--in their behaviors. Some teammates will respond to your commands, while others insist on forging their own paths, which isn't terribly different from human teammates either. It's too bad there's no way to play as the terrorist side on these maps, but assuming you're willing to retry the game on higher difficulty settings after beating it on normal, there's decent value here.

Adding to the game's aesthetic significance is the fact that a special ""deleted scenes"" mode has been included. These deleted scenes actually comprised the single-player campaign that Ritual was working on before game development was handed off to Turtle Rock. While the 12 missions here are pretty fleshed-out--with scripted sequences and dense amounts of action--the deleted scenes, as a whole, feel like clich√©s. To anyone who's played shooters for years, the deleted scenes seem like flashbacks to the shooters of 1999 and 2000, so you'll immediately know why Ritual's project was canceled. While it's nice to have this extra content, your decision on whether to buy Condition Zero shouldn't hinge on it.

27,"Pros and Cons (from a huge fan of Phasmophobia):

Pros:
It is great and has fantastic ideas.
Really nice ghost models.
HUGE potential.

Cons:
It becomes repetitive after you get the hang of insane difficulty"
28,"The game that started all , Remember those days having poteto pc and buying a gaming mouse , Lan parties.
 After Global offensive -sometime i play this game and that bring back a memories of my student days. :) game is having a sentimental value."
29,"amazing,just sad how nobody wants to play this"
30,"This game is like butter, you may not want to eat butter by itself for personal nourishment (unless you are a masochist) but pair it with some toast, etc. Then you have a game you can supplement with your free time (if CSGO makes you tilted I guess). TLDR, the game kills your free time just for the sake of killing time."
31,"Imagine if Valve created a new counter strike game similar to these older titles, just updated graphics and controls.
This is like a nice intro to teh series. You can play campaign, which is just standard online fights with dumb AI. Learn the basics and then go get your ass kicked in online mode in the other games. The online mode in this title has some players still playing, but not nearly as popular as other titles."
32,this game it killed my wife and son who is a csgo pro and play 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 hours of csgo a day
33,go kurac
34,Counter-Strike: Story Mode
35,Nice single player missions
36,the conditions are indeed zero
37,I have Counter Strike condition Zero for the campaign which has a lot of variety and the missions are different which is good and my crit points are if you get caught in checkpoint used and why don't you show the consequences of getting caught in a mission and then try not to repeat it and it reminds me of call of duty black ops 2 . Campaign 7/10
38,I used to play this at college back in 2001. fun game and glad it is still around.
39,I love this game lmao
40,Best CS hands down

49,I love it
50,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR COUNTER-STRIKE CONDITION ZERO DELETED SCENES ***

The only single player campaign in Counter-Strike history. It's a shame, really! It's pretty good, and I'm sure Valve could've turned Counter-Strike into their own version of CoD/Battlefield with awesome multiplayer but even equally good campaigns (the only thing I play when it comes to games like this). 

It's not a story campaign persay, it's an anthology of fully voiced missions where you play as different counter-terrorist from around the world. It's kind of like a rail-shooter mixed with Half-Life puzzle elements. It starts as a mindless shooter but then you need to start walking around in vents and parkouring up gates to get to the next place you need to get. BASICALLY, It's Half-Life, but the aliens are replaced with terrorists. 

It's good. It's okay. It's fun. BUT it can be buggy and a little glitchy. You can get stuck. But remember that Valve cut out these missions and never bothered updating them. There IS 6 bonus missions you can play once you finish the ""main"" campaign missions. Make sure not to miss out on those. You can tell Ritual had a lot of fun making it. Plenty of nice developer easter eggs scattered through-out. 

Highly recommend if anyone wants a Half-Life era CoD-like game, this is for you."
51,"Counterstrike Condition Zero is the perfect CS game. Bots are smarter then you think, and provide endless hours of gameplay. pick this up if you want to play actual story based missions and bonus content cut from the ported xbox release. great game, highly reccomend it to fans of counterstrike 1.5 and so on. 10/10"
52,It was absolutely hated when it came out. Now it's just classed as one of the average/slightly better than average retro games.
53,"Very good game üëç

64,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a follow up to the original Counter-Strike game. This game was released in 2004, so almost eleven years ago. Condition Zero uses the Half-Life engine.

What we have here is a CS game which includes a single player mission pack. When it comes to playing Counter-Strike, I am more or less a newb at it. This game gave me the perfect opportunity to learn the guns, maps and mission types without the pressure of feeling like you are letting your team down by sucking. The campaign took me about four hours to complete, but this was only on Normal mode, you can go back and replay the missions on a higher difficulty to eventually work your way up to playing online.

I also found the squad management system to be a nice little feature which isn't seen in other CS games, at the start of each mission, you can choose which squad members to take with you on the mission, each of the team members have their positive and negative stats so you can really get stuck in with min-maxing them. You start out with three members and you work you way up to having a full blown squad of about eight men.

On each of the missions you also have to complete specific challenges, these can be goals set around killing a certain amount of people, winning the match in less than ninety seconds, rescuing a specific amount of hostages etc etc. This added a little variety of play, especially the challenges where you have to use a certain weapon in order to complete them. This allowed you to learn how to use other guns effectively rather than sticking with your tried and tested Rifle and Deagle.

While the graphics do not come close to looking like games we have in the current day, the game still does look nice. I wasn't put off by the dated graphics one bit; I guess that just shows how good the Half Life engine actually is!

The difficulty levels completely rely on how hard you want to make it. I started out on Normal mode just to get to grips with the game as I am newb like that; but you can work all the way up to playing as if you are in a match online and have the brutally hard experience if you want to. Easy mode is complete walk in the park though, enemies can be standing in front of you for about three seconds before they realize they should shoot you, and even then they spray bullets randomly all around you without actually hitting, so I wouldn't recommend you start out on Easy mode.

Like I said, the campaign took me about four hours to complete, but there are two or three more difficulty levels to try out, and I can see this adding a lot of variety into the game play, so I can easily see the single player alone taking about twelve hours to complete it fully on all difficulties.

I found no technical issues what so ever while playing, I would assume all the bugs and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• would of been ironed out years ago..

In conclusion I can easily recommend Counter-Strike: Condition Zero for anyone looking to get into the FPS or CS scene, it will easily give you a worthwhile experience, giving you the opportunity to learn all of the CS maps, guns and game modes in a pressure free environment."

80,"When i 1st played this CS Condition Zero Deleted Scenes wayback 2004... i was surprised that my country Philippines was included in the game and so proud of it... but ive never been to Basilan or any part of Mindanao south of the country with lots of terrorists activities... this mission seems very creepy u will see corpses with open organs, hear eerie sounds in the jungle and site is very secluded... felt this is a real scenario happening in the south....

i love CZ as much as i love CS 1.6... its just an updated CS 1.6 with better graphics, textures, details, models and new maps... love the bots also here, for me CZ has the best bots {better than Podbots i think), and glad it can be also used in CS 1.6...

the 3 game play modes of CZ are really great, coz u can play as single and Multiplayer... love the missions in single player....

multiplayer with bots:

One reason i bought CS Condition Zero Deleted Scenes (that i can easily get free from other site and i have the original CZ CD too) from Steam is to play the 6 extra bonus missions that aren't not present in my official CS CZ disc... these 6 extra maps after the final mission Rise Hard are: Fastline,Truth in chaos, Run!, Pipe Dream, Sandstorm, Pipe Dream, Miami Heat... been searching for these mission maps in several CS downloading site but can't find one thats complete... so my last resort is to get the one on Steam... these are the only missions i havent played completely. I played the 12 missions many times and also finished some custom and unofficial release maps already...so all in all it has 18 official missions....üòä"
81,it's just cs1.6 with hd textures and models and few more features
82,Good shit
83,counter strike : condition chlupata ri≈•
84,best game ever
85,naposledy hr√°no p≈ôed 3 roky :D
86,Not sure why this exists. It's like a 480p version of 1.6. But it's not bad.
87,"This is really good, the teammate bots behave very nicely. Fun challenges that you can make as hard as you want by adding less mates to your team"

89,Pleasse add new weapon
90,the only good thing in this game is player models.
91,Cs 1.7
92,"Great game
"
93,Deleted scenes are way better
94,10/10
95,"My Personal Game Score: 10 / 10

+ Old is Gold
+ I can play it ALONE.....
+ Good bots with MODS
+ One of the best games that I played in my life.
+ Childhood Game

- Lack of servers. Always full. High ping  :("
96,"I can't hit sh!t with my AK
Not much better with M4 either
"
97,Cool beans
98,"The base game is a scuffed version of 1.6 Everything seems off about it. The Deleted Scenes are so much better, but they still lack in quality. You will get stuck and will have to look up what you're supposed to do. There are strange mechanics and freaking stealth missions. It's terrible."
99,I creamed when I saw the japanese school girls in the tokyo subway mission.
100,"Easily could've been an iconic and memorable CS game had it not been poorly lumped in with Source's launch time. I really like the art direction and unique little quirks in this game, it's like a more polished and characterised 1.6 but sadly due to its shafted release window it seems it'll always be glossed over. 

Kind of telling when 1.6 and CZ have similar designs and yet CZ is just utterly dead. If you have some friends, get them into it you'll love it. But had it not been dead, this'd definitely be a mainstay for me."
101,i love it.
102,Kind of a forgotten game after source engine and Half Life got released? Lol.
103,"Damn, why didn't I play the singleplayer sooner?"
104,"Now how in the fluff does Cooper costs 1 point and is able to kill 6 bots on expert mode but Barney who costs 5 points and is always first to die without a single kill or last to die without a single kill... Barney uses a m4 and Cooper uses a mp5. yet Cooper can get frags. What the actual fluff I was better off just running cooper without BARNEY WHO IS USELESS FRICK YOU BARNEY, ON FASTLINE, AZTEC AND DOWNED YOU CONSTANTLY LET ME DOWN. WHAT THE HECK MAN I LEFT 2 People alive for you YOU BLUE MAN LOOKING ASS HOW THE HELL DID YOU NOT GET ONE SINGLE KILL YOU USELESS PIECE OF TRASH, FRICK YOU AND EVERYTHING YOU STAND FOR WHY DO YOU EVEN EXIST!?!?!? THIS GAME COULD HAVE BEEN DONE 3 HOURS AGO BUT NOOO YOU ARE TRASH PLEASE REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE GAME. COOPER WHO WAS DOGASS WAS GETTING FRAGS OVER YOU LIKE HOW HOW HOW. Rant is done frick Barney and everyone named Barney from the this blue man group to the purple dinosaur, I hate all of you."
105,Literally nobody plays this 6/10
106,great game ig
107,gold
108,the second best game in the series sad the servers died out
109,"Is bad, very very bad. Especially the Deleted Scenes... they should have stayed deleted"
110,"classic
maverick is bro"
111,Awesome campaign! 10/10
112,condition zero when condition one shows up.
113,"It is the same game as Counter-Strike 1.6, but it is a lot more stable, in addition to having the same arcade mode known as ""multiplayer on lan"" it has a very fun campaign mode. In Windows 10, Counter-Strike 1.6 (Steam, original) constantly crashed and I had to use old executables from third-party developers to install the bots, in Counter-Strike Condition Zero everything is ready, you can choose between the map in Condition Zero version and 1.6 original. I like playing for Proton through Manjaro Linux because the API fixes anti-aliasing, texture filtering and implemeting an new modern font.

Hostages are much more alive and smart, they take command from afar, show submission to terrorists, panic in moments of combat and express relief after rescue, they crouch and go through pipes following the rescuer, they make the game more alive.

The game is very worthwhile, if you just want to have fun with the bots through the classic maps without stressing about fixing the bugs of Counter-Strike 1.6, consider buying this game."
114,Approved
115,"Questions? Talk to a human, not to a bot."
116,"Condition Zero, classic of the past."
117,Dude this game litreally crashed and bluescreen  .I just play the game after i install but it seems so laggy than some other counter strike games suddenly it starts to black screen then i tried to repair it after i repaired it   starts to bluescreen by itself
118,da
119,"Cool game, but with the time starts to get boring. It's just like 1.6, but playing with bots. Still recommend!"
120,my condition is zero
121,Nostalgic game
122,Br br
123,Got this during the summer sale 2022 and its pretty good (i only played the single player levels)

125,Well not bad
126,"I'm only going to review the Single player, but after playing it, it just kind of exists? I feel like this was only included because they needed something for people who don't have too many friends actually to play with. Also, some of the challenges are brutal just because of how crappy some of the guns are.

5/10"
127,campaigns are amazing there's something about them idk
128,"love this game sad its so underrated... some levels i did get lost in but the entire journey was fun.... its a great way to learn the basics of csgo and what to and not to do.... 

"
129,Dude only if they timed the release well this would be paid attention to
130,Counter Strike's singleplayer campaign is still better than Call of Duty's.

133,cs 1.6 but more preetee
134,i made some viode setteings now every things its out zoomed cant play cant seem to fix issuse
135,"dont buy it for the multiplayer, half of the servers are chinese modded to death, vannilla deathmatch are impossible to find

147,"Main campaign it's just bad designed and it's not worth it, same for multiplayer.
Deleted Scenes is what makes people buying this game since it has a good campaign. The Extra Levels are nice too.
Since it's an old game, u can close your eyes on the issues that it has and the missing QoL features.
It's sad that Valve doesn't remaster or remake this game."

Should be overwhelmingly positive"

163,Much fun!
164,It's CS but with bots and pretty maps and missions that either make you question if anyone ever truly was a good person or provide a nice stretch
165,Great game for low spec pcs and laptops XD
166,nice
167,i fucking love getting one-shotted by bots
168,"CS:1.6 but it's a campaign.

Yes. Good."

185,"I remember when I used to play this a lot as a kid and get serious with the AI team..

This game still has a unique feeling to it feels nostalgic runs well and textures are pretty clean doesn't seem too outdated for gameplay, it's still not an easy game and brings unique experiences and moments with the friendly AI 

If you miss that old nostalgic CS Vibes get it now! :)"

223,"It's a good game but i think besides the rather mediocre singleplayer its just a graphical upgrade to cs 1.6 which is very much welcome. I think deleted scenes has a lot better singleplayer besides the braindead ai and i wish someone would mod the 2 to make one big mega CS:CZ. Overall its overpriced for what you get, get it on offer."

234,best game i ever played
235,now i see where are operations update come from
236,"""Would I recommend counterstrike?""  Hell #$@*(#ng yes.

This game, despite its age, was made with the perfect graphics to show just enough without bogging down simpler computers and crashing every two minutes.

This was a classic staple in high school days when a bunch of us would pitch in for LAN parties.  You know, back in dial-up days.

Half-life was a great game, story, voices, and design.  Counterstrike in my opinion is the game that accurately determines some of a gamer's true abilities.  As does Diablo 2, Contra, Mario Bro's 3, Smash Bros, Castlevania SotN, FF7 and Chrono Trigger.  Game testers would know all of these games by heart, as do many of us.  I'm no fan of CoD or Halo, but this game gives as fair chance in all perspectives."
237,"I learned how to disarm C4 and kill terrorist.
I can now show my counter-terrorist skills."
238,Good Game.
239,Nice game good graphic
240,"All around a very good game, and because it's just bots no one is there to make fun of you for being bad at the game like me. P.S. It is also a pretty good way to learn how to use weapons."
241,"CS 1.7 if you will. 
Feels freakin' fantastic."
242,Old but gold
243,Counter-Strike 1.6 but it includes a Single Player Mode
244,"So it's actually two games, the base game and Deleted Scenes. The base one is a ""campaign"", if you mean playing matches with bots over 30 times by that. But it's still Counter Strike, so it's actually enjoyable. Deleted Scenes is a traditional campaign with a story line over multiple missions. That's what you are here for."
245,"to jest taki ala counter strike 1.6 ,lecz w tƒÖ wersje osobi≈õcie gra mi sie lepiej jest ciekawy do≈õƒá i jest mniej try hard√≥w oraz cheater√≥w"
246,It is a great title to play offline and on the go

i find that with all these newer games with exceptions like BF 5 they all feel smoother with their gunplay based on fine movements."
248,better than csgo

250,"Tour of Duty pt.1 - Breakdown
This is Counter-Strike's version of a single player campaign not named Deleted Scenes, that focuses on the core aspects of the series at large, the only difference here between this mode and a traditional online game is that you'll play against bots while trying to complete each of a map's objectives; with a few friendly handpicked bots set to back you up. While this might sound good on paper, execution wise, it leaves a lot to be desired.

Tour of Duty pt.2 - Difficulty
There are four difficulty tiers with Tour of Duty, each one ramping up the challenge as you go along. The first two tiers, if you're a CS veteran, you'll probably breeze right through them no problem, but the third tier is when this mode becomes pure agony. This is due to the fact that you're facing tougher bots that can kill you instantly if you even have your body slightly poking out from around a corner, and they can get a headshot on you within mere nanoseconds at just about any distance because, well, they're bots. That's what they're programmed to do. Another thing that adds to the difficulty is that in the final two tiers, you're going to be outnumbered by two or three bots. If you're not skilled enough to dump at least four enemies before you die, well, I got some bad news for you...

Tour of Duty pt. 3 - Ally Bots
As you progress in a tier, you'll have more points to disperse when it comes to ""hiring points."" This just basically means that you can always hire one bot with better AI after every map you clear, but... You probably shouldn't rely on them too much because of how wildly inconsistent they are; They're either so pensive and unsure of themselves that they find a corner to plop down at and stare off into a wall as they get shot in the back of the head or they'll be like the T-1000, just laying waste to the enemy team without so much as flinching. The enemy bots on the other hand are almost guaranteed to be hardened killers, patrolling up and down hallways and capping anybody that they run across. They're ruthless.

Tour of Duty pt.4 - Objectives
The first two tiers have simple enough objectives: Kill 5 enemies, get two kills with the MP5, etc., etc,. These are fun enough to do without really breaking up the game as a whole, but just like everything else, the game gets unbearable in the last two tiers when they start adding stuff like ""get a kill with the knife"" or ""kill a flashbanged enemy and survive the round."" I'll happily admit that I'm no CS god, so things like that are incredibly difficult for me to pull off, especially against the overcharged enemies that you face off against in those rounds. I'll also happily admit that I never got to the last and final tier, so God only knows what they expect you to do in those rounds. Kill two enemies with a frag grenade at once? Kill three people with the knife and survive the round? Sky's the limit I guess.

Combat
I'm going to be plain here: I hate the combat of 1.6, but this is mainly because I spent so many years playing Global Offensive. Going back to this washed up mess of a game is total whiplash and I just don't care for it at all. I just can't seem to tell where my bullets are going to go, and I attribute that to the game's extremely poor crosshair system. Every weapon is so highly inaccurate that my bullets just seem to dance in a perfect circle around my target's head, but, like I stated earlier, your enemies have no trouble shooting you dead the second you pop around a corner. I'll admit it: This game has made me rage more than a couple of times, and I'm not someone who gets rattled very easily.

Map Design
You of course have some CS heavy hitters like Dust, Dust II, and Office in their infancy here, but there's also a number of maps that have gone missing in modern CS, and, again, I'll be plain here: It's because most of the maps featured in this game suck. Fastline is kind of interesting, but it's way too open. Downed is too big and too open. Chateau... While I used to really like this map in my days spent with Source, Tour of Duty mode in this game has absolutely made me hate it to the point where if it was added back to Global Offensive, I'd avoid it like the black plague. Maps like the aforementioned Dust and Office have stuck around through the years because they're just objectively good maps, and they've stood the test of time. Maps like Stadium, Piranisi... They'll remain in the past for a reason.

Graphics
You can't fault this game too much for the primitive graphics, I mean, it is the Goldsrc engine after all which is, at the time of me writing up this review, over two decades old... But... This does mean that the game can't ever be ""prettied up."" Even if you download a bunch of mods, they won't have any fancy shader effects on them, no reflections, etc. Graphics doesn't mean much, but when the gameplay is so terrible as it is in 1.6, some fancier graphics would actually make a difference for me.

Sound
Counter-Strike was never known for having a stellar soundtrack or anything, so I don't have much to say about the generic music featured here, but I can say that, without a doubt, the bot chatter pack in this game is absolutely atrocious. Your buddies sound like stone cold nerds, and, I know nerds are the clientele for Counter-Strike and I'm one of them, I don't like hearing these guys sound as square as they do. It's just a choice of preference, but still.

Conclusion
I can't recommend this game because it's just not fun. Not 100% fun anyway. I'd rank it as being 30% fun and 70% hair-pulling frustration. I loved the first two difficulty tiers because they offered a fair challenge, but the third tier wasted so much of my life that I just had no more energy to push on, which brings me to another point: With this game being as difficult as it is, why in the world aren't there any achievements?! I understand that this is an old game but, come on... Even I would have stuck around past my frustrations to get some hard earned achievements, but with no incentive to keep going? No dice. I uninstalled this game and don't have any intentions on playing it again."
251,cool game
252,Old-school classic
253,"If you like CS you would definitely enjoy this one, bring back old memories, just buy it already."
254,OG
255,CZ is my go to game over any of the other CS games
256,"I bought this game originally at Best Buy in 2005 and didn't load it onto Steam with the product key until college. Needless to say that my ""52 hours on record"" is completely false. That number is closer to 5000 hours on record. I must have played this almost every day after school with friends from 7th grade all the way through my senior year of high school. 

The core gameplay, even to this day, is incredibly enjoyable. It's why today, 18 years after release, people are still actively on here playing. The map mods that people created on this game are second to none. I remember when I first discovered the ""surf"" mechanic, and that there will around 30 maps created to fit this concept. The map mods were insane. Springfield from the Simpsons, Tattooine from Star Wars, someone even created a map that perfectly details your nearest Wal-Mart! The creativity astounded me and I loved every second of it. Unfortunately most of these are dead and buried, as the player base (while still going) is nowhere where it used to be.

Some of my fondest gaming memories are from this game, and booting it up today gives me such nostalgia. While I had been an avid fan of gaming already, this cemented my interest in being a ""gamer""."
257,"If you've played this game in your childhood, regardless of your current age, this game will bring you the nostalgia of your childhood period."
258,Added the single player mode in the legendary counter strike.

And it is a Valve game so it is rely great. It has also online so you can play with other people, YES people still play the online in this game so you will have enough people to play with."
264,"If Counter-Strike had a campaign it would pretty much be this. It's sometimes pretty fun, sometimes questionable but it's an interesting idea that i wish they continued and did more of because it has alot of potential to shine when done correctly."

272,"I only played through the tour of duty missions, I think its overall a pretty fun experience. Its a bunch of matches vs bots with specific challenges each map. If you've never played older counter strike its a more accessible way to play it vs going against real people."
273,its ok
274,Underrated
275,gg
276,"I've been playing this game since I was 5 and I can't stop returning to it. There is a lot of downloadable content for free to add more fun to the game. I also have to add that the main reason i have so many hours on this game is because i usually play on local campaigns with my dad or sister and we try to beat all the maps while increasing the difficulty little by little, and it's so rewarding still. So yes, we don't play online, we just enjoy beating the bots and completing missions. 

1. Bots are insane. Compared to modern CS this bots can easily destroy you on hard or higher difficulties. 
2. Tons of maps, skins, customized campaigns or whatever you want to add to it. 
3. Unbalanced weapons. There are just a few weapons that can be useful in this game. 
4. Amazing sound design.
5. You can't marry Maverick, but you can hear him say NO to every order you give him every day if you want. 

I'd recommend this game to any son/father that wants to have some fun in a game with no PC requirements. 10/10 you will enjoy it."
277,"[h1]Counter-Strike: Condition Zero - Review[/h1]

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a game, that does not really have any new features, except for bots. Other than that, it's almost the same game as the classic Counter-Strike. In terms of the ""campaign"", it's poor - boring and unnecessarily hard. Your bots get blocked on ladders. Enemy bots have an aim assist, so I found the game quite annoying on higher difficulties. I played all the difficulties, and yeah, Expert was a pain in the ass.
I can't say anything about multiplayer - didn't play it too much.

Anyway, the game is definitely not revolutionary. If someone enjoys playing vs annoying bots, or maybe got nostalgic an wants to play their childhood game - go ahead. Otherwise, I do not recommend."
278,There's an actual christian server i'm not joking

352,"The Tour of Duty 'campaign' is ok, it's fun to play an old CS game with bots which wasn't possible without mods before this game.

The Deleted Scenes campaign however is brilliant, a true Counter-Strike single player campaign. Ritual Entertainment's work here is much better than the bot matches labelled as a 'campaign' in the main game. This should have been in the main game and not hidden away. At least we can be glad it was even released at all and not just joined the pile of unreleased Valve projects. It also received an additional six missions in later updates that are playable from the World Map. If you're a Counter-Strike fan, give both a go but if you only have the time to try one, choose Deleted Scenes."

358,It's Counter Strike 1.6 if it were a singleplayer game instead of a multiplayer one.
359,Siempre fue choto. Comparado a los otros lanzamientos este no tuvo nada de √©xito.
360,Classic CS with bots. Runs on a potato and still more fun than most newer games.
361,"In regards to the Deleted Scenes content:

Being released only months prior before source back in 2004, I felt like this game was swept under the rug. This game is a half-life inspired campaign that puts you in a number of counter-terrorist scenarios. From recovering nuclear stolen warheads, to hostage rescue mission within secret cartel bases hidden in the jungle ---- This game offers an array of thrilling and exciting missions that offer a decent challenge.

Condition Zero Experienced a lot of setbacks during its development, yet the intricate design of the game, from level pathways, Easter eggs, to the overall setting of each level certainly highlights the developers' passion in producing this game. It's a shame this game has drifted into obscurity, for it is a must play for any lover of the FPS genre."
362,"Great game. Nice if you didnt have to use specific guns.
Fun to play for practice."
363,l'good shit
364,"it's like the bots have a health condition that makes their iqs zero, the team ai is incompetent, they always get in my fucking way, they miss so much and this game is just full of bullshittery, the bots can run and gun all they want and hit most of their shots, some weapons are really fucking inaccurate, an example is the krieg sniper, if you stand still and aim right at your enemy it's a 20% chance you will hit them but if it's with a scout you will hit them even tho the scout is cheaper. the krieg sniper costs a good amount more and should be better but it's not, it should be like the csgo autosnipers."

"
382,nice
383,"Counter Strike, the world's most popular first-person shooter game. Arguably over 2 million people are playing this game at this very moment as you are reading this post. The game was developed from the old game known as Quack, which had poor graphics but was one of the most addictive games of its time. The game has had many improvements since then, at first counter strike was not known to many and it wasn't until counter strike 1.5 that people really got into this game. The next version which was condition zero was even a better version of the previous 1.5, but then 1.6 really changed things and set the standards for playing counter strike in the big leagues. The next version which was counter strike source had a completely new engine and many liked it but most did not, it is really more about what a player prefers I can play counter strike 1.6 but if someone asks me to play source I would keep playing because they are equally fun to play but again it is based on preference. The next revolution in Counter Strike is Counter Strike Global Offensive which has a touch of 1.6 and Source. So Counter Strike Global Offensive is the new thing in the world of Counter Strike and is said to be the standard game used worldwide for the big leagues like WCG."

406,very good
407,game keren
408,"This thing is good and provides good game mechanics and everything, albeit the recoil in some cases where it's kinda errrr, so besides that it's still got a good community in active servers like UGC"
409,good game
410,"A game to put Half-Life 1 [and Valve] to shame.
This hidden gem runs on the GoldSrc engine, but really showcases what the engine has to offer.
Each mission has it's own background story. Throughout the game you will come across Corny dialogue makes for a good laugh.
The level design is convincing and realistic, with custom models for each level.
Small scripted events with custom animation make this game immersive.
Once you play this game you will realise Half-Life didn't live up to it's full potential for what the GoldSrc engine had to offer.
I will replay again, again and again."
411,im feel
412,"This was my first game I got on steam, I don't why I chose this first but it is a very fun game overall."
413,holy **** the ai is complete aids
414,"ummmmmmmmmm ok ok .. the same as cs 1.6 , just 
unfortunately not as good as 1.6"
415,yes
416,"Nice to include a campaign, and multiplayer really improved
"
417,Dua Lipa
418,good ol days
419,My first PC game
420,good
421,"the idea of Counter-Strike being singleplayer is pretty cool, i enjoyed my short time playing this"
422,Classic + Better Textures + Story
423,i got raped by terrorist
424,its a good game but with less players
425,"Kinda mid, ngl"
426,Old but Gold!
427,extremely fun
428,good
429,a very good classic
430,Classic
431,Great old game. The challenges are good and there are lots.
432,"despite what people say about this game, i think its pretty cool. The missions are very nice to go thru, and i personally use bot system to test my cs maps for layout problems, games just a bit neglected thats all at least they got the m4 anim right"
433,"this game is so slept on, idk why people dont play it"
434,"Recommend
At the time of its release it wasn't very good, but nowadays, it's fun to boot up a lightweight, yet graphically improved version of cs. And the tour of duty is pretty fun."
435,Counter-Strike Condition Zero is just Counter Strike 1.6 but you can play with bots.
436,"Terrible AI, but still better than CSGO"
437,very cool (y)
438,"been playing this for over 2 decades, and its still my favorite game of all time and never gets old. classic fps."
439,"Fun game with firends, specailly in furian mode ‚ô•"
440,"the BEST FPS game ever made

I played it since it first came out and its just amazingly the best FPS game :)

classic!"
441,it is funi monke
442,Basically Counter-Strike story mode.
443,i didnt defuse the bomb
444,"nostalgia,but he map was'nt a lot like i used to play when i was a child"
445,
446,"Are you lonely on a weekend and have no plans? Do you wish Counter-Strike had a single player campaign? Well fret not! Counter-Strike: Condition Zero surely does hit the mark of single player content in a Counter-Strike game, but that's about it. The single player content is kind of like Mission Mode in Mario Kart DS or Spec Ops in the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series. This games name also match the amount of active players, 0. There is literally no reason to get this game nowadays when CS:GO has more to offer and CS:Source is just better. But, if you're an avid Counter-Strike fan and want to collect all the games, I'd say wait for it to go on sale. Damn near every Summer and Winter you can pick up this game for a dollar. Not to mention the development process behind this and CS:CZ Deleted scenes makes this an interesting piece of Valve history."
447,there are many players that cheat on condition zero and 1.6.
448,"I miss the people I played with.
They moved on just like me but what great friends I made..."
449,Me go surf surf
450,red headed step child
451,wtf i just played
452,nice
453,Nostalgia
454,Best game. I enjoyed till now after all this years.
455,Fun to test
456,its fun xD
457,"Super fun throwback, good predecessor of CSGO"
458,grenades are op
459,"dont visit my proflie

"
460,zero conditions to play (my mom hates shooter games)
461,"Decent enough game, the missions later on get super repetitive and boring and honestly the game is buggy and hard to figure out certain puzzles due to just how poorly built the game is. But overall was decent enough."
462,fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun when your good at sex and stratgiesing sperm bomb plants lol hfdrfwarwasfdqweas
463,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a first-person shooter game published by VAlve.  It is an improved version of the original Counter-Strike, which was a mod for the game Half-Life.  Initially focused on the single-player ""story"" mode, however, it was cut from the main version of the game and was later released under the name ""Deleted Scenes"""
464,"well, at least this one you can play with bots if you dont find servers of community in your area"
465,Nice game
466,"Yea if you dont have any disk space for playing CS:GO you can play this game, but this more harder, cost of money, yea"
467,"If i still had my old steam account from 2005, I would have logged on (by now) at least 5000 hours :)
Best CS. <WpK> forever!"
468,"People complain about CS S being the worst in the series, cause they don't want to admit Condition Zero is truly the black sheep of Counter Strike.

First of all, there are no differences between 1.6 and CZ (if there is any). Graphically is the same. Same weapons. Same HUD but with different color. The only good improvement I noticed was adding the Spetsnaz and Midwest Militia. 

But the worst thing is that still uses GoldSrc... in 2004... That same year Half Life 2 and CS S arrived with the new Source engine, which is fresh even 20 years later with ragdoll mechanics, better graphics, etc. I understand Valve and TurtleRock Studios had issues doing the game, but looks like a joke that in the same year we got a game made with the Half Life engine and its sucesor.

I said there were barely some changes, right? Well, we've got some kind of ""operations"", which are basically levels trying to stop terrorists with bots. So almost nothing that makes this game superior than 1.6, Source or Global Offensive. 

And for last, game includes Deleted Scenes, which is the only thing worth playing from this. Originally this game was suposed to include campaign, and I must admit Valve and TurtleRock made their best with that. Might not be the glory, but it's was more amusing than base game."
469,same game who cares mate
470,Great fun!
471,"Just a legend understand what was that!
If you know, So you're a legend.
"
472,"step 1:buy cs 1.6
step 2:enjoy
now in all honesty this is just cs 1.6 with a different name valve just went hey can i copy your homework sure but change a few things so that the teacher wont know and this is how this was born"
473,awesome game :D
474,"Classic to own on Steam.

Recommended."
475,pretty decent counter-strike game
476,had a lot of fun with it
477,Nice
478,"I thought that this was just some add-on Valve wanted us to try
It (kinda) is, but really good"
479,"This game saved my life.

I'm 27.

My ex and I have a girl together, and took on our child together. They are presently both 4 years of age.

At the point when we were going through our detachment, I wound up lost and hopeless. I was reckless. I got so frantic one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some substantial in a snapshot of overpowering feeling. That made me break my fifth metacarpal in my right hand... my functioning hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and conveyed my youngsters to bed with.. The hand I frantically expected to ensure I could keep on giving.

In the wake of learning of the seriousness of my self-caused harm, I was fringe self-destructive. Remember that only a couple of months before this, I was the most joyful man without really any set of experiences of sadness or tension. I have never had angry outbursts, or been one to separate and cry, yet I was in a low spot that very covered me from having the option to see the light on the opposite side.

Having nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play, ONE Gave while I recuperated. I some way or another coincidentally found this game and read a portion of the audits. I concluded that it must merit a shot... I should concede, I didn't beat the game, or play close to as long as some of you. Indeed, I might have just played this game a little while.. So, in the wake of doing as such, I had a freshly discovered satisfaction and expectation forever. I had the option to put behind me the aggravation and experiencing that had been projected over me. I had the option to encounter different people groups euphoria and joy. I had the option to see the my ""rewards for so much hard work"". I loose for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music adequately long to understand that I would have been OK.

Subsequent to realizing that, I switched the game off, and I returned to work. It hurt my hand like hellfire however I was propelled. I quit feeling so damn upset for myself, and I turned into the dad I should have been at that time, not the feeble kid I was acting as.

Today, I'm dear companion with my children mother. We don't battle, or contend, or direct pernicious sentiments toward one another. We are guardians, and companions.

I presently have 3 children. My third kid is, sit tight for it, Likewise 4 Years of age. The lady I'm with was going through a very much like circumstance at the hour of my own division, and we just staggered in to every others life suddenly. We have been seeing someone per year now, and are extremely content.

Lesson of the story, no one can tell what life holds coming up for you, and in the event that I would have surrendered when all the situation was anything but favorable for me, I wouldn't be the place where I'm today. This senseless minimal game assisted me with understanding that.

Much obliged to you"

490,"A classic PC FPS experience that has a number of single player missions, fun skirmish mode with bots and still has a small multiplayer following, if you like counter strike or classic PC games then I would pick this up especially when its on sale its fun to mess around with bots etc"
491,.
492,"What a nostalgia trip, it's still as good as the first time I played it. Just remember to disable grenades for the bots."
493,only buy it in the valve complete pack for a big discount. wouldn't buy it for full price. it's fun but some maps are truly garbage.
494,poop
495,its pretty all right and is pretty fun
496,"With its extensive Tour of Duty campaign, a near-limitless number of skirmish modes, updates and new content for Counter-Strike's award-winning multiplayer game play, plus over 12 bonus single player missions, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a tremendous offering of single and multiplayer content."
497,I had fun somehow...

505,"Here you will see why I love Half-Life, but in my review you will read about why I gave it a negative review due to some problems.

I love Counter-Strike: Condition Zero I am trying to figure out though if Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a tutorial for Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes' singleplayer campaign stories? Either way I love playing Counter-Strike: Condition Zero.

Now Counter-Strike: Condition Zero using OpenGL instead of DirectX 8 gives me OpenGL errors.

Here is a screenshot of one of the few OpenGL errors I experience here and there. Followed by freezing of the video games that use OpenGL, before crashing.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/887417416764768257/926930307003850792/OpenGL_errors_on_video_games_that_use_OpenGL_on_Windows.png

VALVe please add DirectX 8 support or at least a more up to date version of DirectX 9 support which supports 64-bit, which is DirectX 9.0C I believe?

Otherwise I cannot give Counter-Strike: Condition Zero a positive review due to these technical issues, which I cannot seem to fix even if I reinstall Windows or Counter-Strike: Condition Zero.

Also VALVe please release Counter-Strike, with Counter-Strike:Condition Zero, and Counter-Strike: Source included for sale on gog.com. You have said with the Source 2 engine that video game developers developing video games on the Source 2 engine can release the video games that they develop for sale on gog.com please."

509,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
510,"Hello my name is Texture and im addicted to Counter strike condition zero,i`ve tried several rehabs around the world,they don`t seem to help,i`ve tried breaking my laptop,it still turns on,i`ve tried unstalling the game it just popped back into my laptop,please send help.

If you want a challenging single-player mode with different difficulties and maps, then this game has what you want but expect some bugs and the AI isnt great but gets the job done and its challenging enough for a good time.

The Deleted Scenes game only adds more content to CZ with new missions all over the world where you play as different units with a story behind each mission and a lot of objectives to follow. The game isnt recent but you can still have fun with it in 2014, at least, in my opinion.

I totally recommend if you wanna have some single-player fun."

Based on the information provided, can you guess what game this review is for? What's it about? What kind of game is it?

Point is, these reviews are completely interchangeable. I bet if you took this exact review, and copy and pasted it to every game in your library, you'd get the top review for half of the games you put it on, even if you didn't change the check marks to fit each individual game.

In my opinion, the Steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion. Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.

Anyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?"
602,ty.!
603,Good!

608,Best game ever
609,"If you wanted to play any of the early CS games, this is one of your best bets. It comes with bots by default and has a bad, yet fun campaign, it's just a series of normal CS matches with some objectives added to it. It's multiplayer is still active to this very day and if you are a fan of the OG Half-Life, this is an OG Half-Life spin off game, so you will enjoy it.

610,"Basically every tour of duty for me with MAVERICK

CT Commander: Stick together team - follow me!

629,"CZ as a hole got a lot of hate for having many broken promises, but i never understood why the deleted scenes were... well deleted scenes. While it may not be half life, despite being in the same engine, czds offeres a fun glob trotting campaign. While a bit run of the mill, its hard to fault it too much as it was unfinished. A good way to practice with the weapons if you still play older cs games. It was also quite nice that they added six additional missions post launch for free."

648,i like the new maps but its kind of dead
649,Great game but sometimes i don't get the aiming pattern!
650,"They tried to do something new here, which is something. Single player is very basic at best. Multiplayer is the same as CS 1.6 with slightly higher resolution textures. You are better off just sticking to CS 1.6 if you want the old school feel, this one can be skipped. Not a bad game, but nothing new and exciting beyond 1.6, more of the same, but different. Stick to 1.6"

654,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is an expansion pack and, in a sense, a visual upgrade for Counter-Strike 1.6, with more HD looking models and new detail textures, which were created for the game's exclusive maps for a better graphical experience, but there's more than meets the eye.

CS:CZ introduced a campaign mode, called the Tour of Duty, which is treated as a single-player experience, consisting of tasks that the player must complete if they want to advance to the next mission. The Tour of Duty campaign consists of 6 chapters, called ""tours"", with each tour containing 3 maps (missions) in it. In order to efficiently play against the enemy team and be able to have a chance on winning them, it is strongly recommended/most definitely essential that one recruits members for their team, though that comes with a cost. The amount/skill-strength of soldiers that the player is able to recruit is determined by Reputation Points, which are gained by completing missions (though some are also granted to the player at the beginning of the tour, and the amount depends on the difficulty chosen). In general the campaign is pretty easy to learn and while it can sometimes be frustrating due to either some ridiculous tasks (especially in harder difficulties) or just the difficulty of the game itself, it's still a fun and addictive experience.

Since CS:CZ is the first game that introduced built-in bots, the game also technically introduced an offline (multiplayer) mode, which gives the player the ability to either target practice or just kill some time, but everything else is identical to CS 1.6.

CS:CZ had received quite the undeserving flak because it was released in the same year as the Source engine, which was Valve's breakthrough product, and since with it also came Counter-Strike: Source, it's only natural that it would unfortunately outshine this game in every aspect and place it as an ""obsolete on arrival"" product. Also the fact that the development state of this game had been bad in every aspect, having changed development teams twice over the course of 4 years, which obviously brought over significant delay, very sadly helped in making Condition Zero lose most of its relevance by the time that it hit the shelves.

With everything being said above, CZ's infamous reputation among the Counter-Strike franchise is attributed not as much to it being ""lackluster"" as it is to it being unlucky due to all the delays, overhauls as well as the horrendously bad timing of its release with the Source engine. Otherwise, this game has much to offer and its status as an underrated cult-classic is here to stay.

Score:

666,"It's not quite where my CS journey started, but I can play FY Pool Day, and with bots. Which is great, because I have no friends, and what a great way to spend a Friday night.

It's the classic CS experience, with the classic maps, guns and game mods, and there are plenty of maps out there, which are easy to download.

If you want to hit the shooter nostalgia right, this is the game for you."

677,best game ever!
678,<3
679,I only got this for deleted scenes lol
680,Very Nice!!!
681,"really good game. its almost like half life, but in cs 1.6. the story is shit, but that dosen't matter. The levels are great, and action even better."
682,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a really great game for it's solo story.
The game still holds up really nice.
Played it as a kid and loved it, it's still worth it on sale."
683,big dildo
684,is nice
685,its half life but guns
686,My AI team mate threw a grenade at me and the hostages. 100/10 would get team killed again.
687,6.5/10
688,good
689,Underrated cs in the franchise. I loved it.
690,"Back in time when I didn't have the internet, bots were my friends."
691,one of the best games i have ever played <3
692,"It's Counter Strike but with missions and objectives. I used to play this a lot when i was a kid. Hard Bots were really difficult to deal with until you got any semblence of a ""working"" team. Most of the time I was all alone vs a full team of terrorists....
Had fun though, especially with the missions."
693,"Causes me motion sickness !
+
No FOV option !"
694,Just getting started.
695,"Literally i just use this game to lift. I do single player, max difficulty, set up a custom team and i do my sets knowing full well that if i take to long the game will pause between rounds automatically. I love Counter-Strike, and i love Condition Zero. Thanks for helping me get stronger. I won't forget you when i get huge!"
696,"cs condition zero deleted scenes is the only good counter strike game

what other counter strike game has, UNMODDED: literal porn, extremely questionable accents for all speaking characters, an end of evangelion poster, tons of bizarre easter eggs, segments taken straight from MGS1 and 2, some of the accidentally funniest setpieces i've seen in a video game, slapstick cartoon credits

yeah thought so"
697,"Great fun, even after all these years"
698,F u
699,Nice !! :)
700,Good Old Days
701,"[i]*Since this is a remaster to Counter-Strike and I feel like some of what I have said on the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/ciocolici/recommended/10?snr=1_5_9__402]review for that game[/url] applies here as well, I am going to quote that stuff here. Afterwards I am going to write how I feel about what the remaster brings new, and of course also about Deleted Scenes.[/i]

[quote]Counter-Strike used to be my curse and my primary hobby. I have thousands upon thousands of hours spent in this game. So many nights... I had a dozen of Steam accounts created only to play CS on a (now dead) platform called PlayZeek, which was kind of what FaceIT is for CS:GO. This game represents my childhood and when I say CS all I think about is nostalgia.

CS's middlename is ESports, and it would not be an understatement if we would say that ESports wouldn't be today what it is, without this game. This game's ESports has died, obviously, but the game's community did not. Which is mindblowing. You don't have an issue finding a server with players at any given time, night or day. For a game so old it's wow. So if you're nostalgic and want to get back into this game, you won't have one problem, even after all this time. 

But for someone that has never played this before.. it is hard, it takes thousands of hours to learn the recoil and gameplay, has not aged well, looks ugly and the gameplay can probably only be understood and enjoyed by people that have understood and enjoyed it at its time. 

Going back to the game for a little bit of time was something unique. The feels, the nostalgia, the sounds, the gameplay, everything sends me back to my childhood, to a time without adult issues and only free time to waste (or spend) playing CS and dreaming of becoming the best. And expected to start the game, join a server, die instantly and then leave. But it actually made me play more. And I actually started to enjoy it. But I also understood the reasons why I would never come back to the game. What I have once seen as masterpiece, I now see as old gameplay. I still find it fun, to a point, I just can't see it with the same eyes I once did. 

This is a relic, a masterpiece for its time. To a point it can still be for most people that have used to play it at that time. I think updating the graphics to today standards, and maybe meddling a little bit with the gameplay, would make this game appeal to new people. The fact that this game has never died after sooooo many years, and it still has such an alive playerbase, says a lot. Normally I would suggest you play CS:GO instead of this, but I see them as totally different games, for probably different players. This one requires way more skill and it is way more punishing. What this game needs is the same gameplay and feel, but with today visuals. CS:CO (Classic Offensive) is more fitting to suggest here, but unfortunately, at the time writing this, it is still in development.[/quote]

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero has always been, for me, the better-looking same Counter-Strike that nobody likes. And that's what it is to a degree. It looks a little better, has other sounds, some new stuff like singleplayer with bots and that's all. It is Valve's attempt to remaster it. Most players did not move to it, neither did the CS pro scene. I, for one, now after trying it again, like them both, but prefer the original. They both have pros and cons, but in the end they're both the same game. I see it only about preference and taste. I like the original more than this. CZ also has way tinier playerbase since forever, and while in CS I had no issues finding servers with players to play on, in CZ I struggled to find what I was looking for: anything not DM. And those that I found were using the original CS maps and models and stuff, I did not even feel like playing CZ. But there still are players playing, which really is something to applaud. 

There's then Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. If CZ was an attempt to remaster the original, CZ DS is an attempt to make a campaign with story and all. And, although many were okay-ish with it, for me it was a disaster. Did only enjoy it because it was CS gameplay, other than that... boring, boring and... boring. Story is there like it isn't, and it's just like... the way the original CS works gameplaywise, movementwise and so on, it does not work as a singleplayer campaign. And this is a weird statement, since the same movement system is present in Half-Life, and dozens of mods of Half-Life, but that's how I felt. Boring and uninteresting. There are so many mods that use Half-Life and look & play one thousand times better than this wannabe game. 

So CZ is a yes, if you find it better than the original, but CZ DS is a big no, it should not have been made in the first place."
702,"The Deleted Scenes campaign absolutely makes this worth it, honestly reminiscent of the single-player experience you find in OLD Battlefield 1. I kinda wish they remaster the whole story, it is so cool for history buffs interested in the happenings of global crime/terrorism in the late 80s through the 90s."
703,overall its a great game and more decorated than (cs) 1.6 but the AI is extremely good xD.
704,"Useful if you want to try out some classic CS without having to go through community servers. The campaign challenges are also fun. I swear the bots have personalities of their own

To make the game even remotely playable though, you will first need to set up custom keybinds and fastswitch"
705,Campaign modunu oynarken √ßok eƒüleniyorum
706,"It is still difficult to find good servers and Anti-Cheat Filter does not work.

CSGO is better at this moment"
707,Good Beans!
708,the ai is extremely smart it blocked my way to defuse the bomb after i killed the last terrorist and only moved after it had 1 second left
709,"Great game for someone who is looking for gameplay and team work rather than high end graphics...prefer this over CS GO as i still dont have a graphics card since 2007 and this game runs perfectly even on entry level processors.Only long time players can appreciate the beauty of this game,the newer generation may have a differerent take on this"
710,The game is OG should be recommended to erveryone
711,idk what to say
712,"Eh, decent!"
713,based
714,"I loved this game, but the story mode can be boring sometimes. I'm glad I got it. A slight update to an already classic game."
715,[H1]I ·¥ò·¥Äss·¥á·¥Ö ·¥Ñs!
716,"Bang Bang shoot em up, the party never ends. You can't feel like dying when the bottle's your best friend."
717,"The campaign is just bot matches, legit just play CS 1.6"
718,the game is fun to play even in modern day the multiplayer is outdated and so are the graphics but the AI are okay and fun to play against
719,1.6 but without friends
720,10/10
721,ok
722,teammate AI is unironically better than any CSGO casual match i've ever played
723,CZ
724,Played this when i was a kid :)
725,Always play this a few rounds when I am getting back into some Counter Strike Source or GO... Also play it with my daughter who is only starting to play games! So far she has enjoyed it.
726,Better than 1.6 but sadly it didn't get its recognition.
727,"Nobody reads these reviews anymore, so i will just say that i am gay."
728,4444
729,its really good and fun but honestly scary
730,gud
731,It's cool. The bot missions are cute.
732,cs 1.6 but it's remade
733,Simple fun game that can be played across most low powered computers to high the same for internet speed .The game is ageless .
734,"Muito bom para quem curte/curtiu o CS cl√°ssico, diversas miss√µes legais de se fazer"
735,maybe
736,"I wouldn't buy this for the normal mode for the bots. I bought it in conjunction with the CS games and got it.

I really enjoyed the bonus campaign. It was fun and very reminiscent of 2000's gaming. While it is dated, I thought it was worth while to play through."
737,yes
738,A classic
739,It is my D U T Y to beat this single player they have
740,always a classic from 1.4 to c.z to source to go its always nice to revisit and see how far the world UI has come!
741,"ŸÑÿπÿ®ÿ© ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿπ
good game"
742,"i play to pass the time its a great game.
"
743,Niceeee!
744,counter-strike but without stupid sivlers
745,"Nobody reads the reviews for sure, so I'll say I'm gay"
746,Better than CSGO
747,"Divertido para jogar com amigos , nunca joguei esse jogo com amigos mas acho que seria bacana etc , se alguem tiver interessado em jogar sapoha eh so add ai q a gente joga , sempre tive interesse em ter amigos para jogar jogos junto etc .

"
755,classic
756,very good would recommend cause it fun and got good ai missions and the online  servers are still popular even after so many years

758,"I joined a server where Spiderman was the terrorist and Batman as anti-terrorist, what kind of people play this game ?"
759,"how the f*ck do i play it

Edit: i still dont know

Bonus Edit ! : In all seriousness basically just better 1.6 but panned at release for not being distinct enough from said game which is a fair criticism."
760,cs 1.6 is better
761,My condition is terminal
762,"Yes.
"
763,This game truly takes me back to my teenage years! I have such fond memories playing this game with my brothers and friends too. I like this game so much that I can't transition to Global Offensive. There is comfort in simplicity I suppose - it's not hard to pick up. Give it a shot and tell me what you think!
764,Really nice game me gusta
765,One of the classic.
766,"The Deleted Scenes campaign absolutely makes this worth it, honestly reminiscent of the single-player experience you find in Battlefield 1.

801,This game is like that one family member who shows up to the reunion but nobody really talks too and you don't see them outside family reunions. It's still a decent-ish game
802,"It's basically an update to CS 1.6, is a good game, I had lot of fun on it on the nosteam version before and I do believe that this game should be in every OG gamer's library!

In conclusion, I warmly recommend it!"
803,ydes
804,Classic game. Simple.
805,Pew pew
806,"I only played this game for the campaign part of it & it is definitely worth it & very enjoyable.
8/10"
807,"In my personal opinion this is the worst counter strike game, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad, but it‚Äôs the worst of the best. It‚Äôs fun to hop on and play this game for a round or two every now and then, but compared to every other counter strike this game just doesn‚Äôt feel as entertaining."
808,"Condition Zero in my opinion is much better than the original Counter Strike, even though the differences between them arent huge. The main differences are Condition Zero has Bots built in, slightly better graphics, and maybe a little more features, but thats it. Everything else feels the same, the gameplay is almost the same. Today we have Source and Global offensive which are newer and have much better graphics, but for people who still enjoy the classic, simpler gameplay, Condition Zero is a better choice than the original Counter Strike, despite the fact the differences arent that huge between them."
809,"It's Counter Strike, but with single player, campaign single player (deleted scenes), plus updated model and texture."
810,epic game
811,yes
812,"It's essentially just Counter-Strike with new player and weapon models, revamped maps, and two single-player modes (Tour of Duty and Deleted Scenes). In addition, it has an official built-in bot in case you want to play offline (or even practice your skills)."
813,bad... bad game...
814,deleted scenes is way better than this.
815,nice
816,"Good for playing Offline

824,I love this game!
825,pwnage ^_-
826,wtf copy of cs go i hate it
827,"ahh what to say... I first started playing this game when I was 4 or 5ish and well never did I realise this would be a huge part of my life, thousands of hours with my cousins and other friends into this video game and I can definitely say those were the best days of my life <3,  then I stopped playing cuz of well..reasons and after years I am finally back and well now I am nub af in this game (always have been a noob :v) but I still find this game very very fun, its not the graphics, its something else, idk what it is but this game never makes me feel bored no matter what and I am really happy that there are still at least few active servers left for this absolute masterpiece"
828,"simple, fun and addicting. im not a hardcore gamer but i like to play mariokart and that kind of stuff. this is really the only shooter i play"
829,Too much nostalgia!!!
830,Yah
831,"Buen juego, la verdad no tengo en mente como se les ocurrio hacer un modo historia.

832,Love it :)
833,"This game is and always will be better than CS:GO. Fight me.
Actually don't you'd probably win. Debate me. Actually don't I'd most likely lose the argument.
You know what? I just realized I actually suck at Counter Strike and therefore my opinion is invalidated.
But f*** you it's still better than CS:GO. 
The day all the kids finally understand that they have been playing a mod of half life all along, we will be one step closer to achieve world peace. Until Valve releases [MENTIONING OF THE NUMBER 3 HAS BEEN DELETED BY ADMINISTRATOR]

837,coter-srike is gud gam üëç
838,Classic FPS game. Also mac friendly and great for low end PCs.
839,"are you reading the reviews????????
what ? do you need reason to buy cs?"
840,Counter-Strike but with a singleplayer campaing
841,Easy to play
842,good game 9.99 is a good price in 2022. i will never forget this game. i will miss it.
843,"This is a great game and for 2004, I think this game is actually really decent! The Graphics was a great major step from 1.6! It is amazing old, but still amazing!"
844,old fun
845,love it
846,come on let me complete challenges and remind me when i was 12 years old
847,Fun and includes the old 1.6 maps
848,While my pc died I enjoy playing this on my macbook lmao
849,Good game
850,classic games.
851,me when with strangers
852,GGWP GAME play from Fatality Server :D
853,i can't describe it... it's a Legendary Game !!!
854,This is a pretty good jumble of missions. The game feels off though.
855,wait whats this again
856,great for offline play
857,"This game uses OpenGL, so expect low FPS."
858,this is like the call of duty games having a singleplayer and a multiplayer.
859,man this is the first game that i played in my life...this game like diamond for me ...i love this game its extremely awesome  the best game for low spesification and it is best for all shooting gamers .. I LOVE THIS GAME!
860,Fantastic game!
861,"this game is a mixed bag and because the game is sold as condition zero and not condition zero deleted scenes i will review it as condition zero
so the dev went into a meeting and had a discussion about how to make bot difficult and fun to play against some suggestions flew like make the bots difficult but realisitc like a good player at higher difficulties make the bots strong in general with some downsides for both sides and then was some guy who said lets just give the bots 100% accuraccy, tracking, wall hacks and infinite money and turn the player's bots completley useless by not giving them infinite cash giving even the best bots shit accuraccy and thinking and his suggestion was accepted for some reason and the devs did it now every time you get into a fight with good bots you will mostly likely loose because guess what your teammates all though advertised as ""high"" skill will perform on a level of ok and be completley retarded

okay lets make it a bit clearer lets say we have 2 bots same skill level expert difficulty vs high everything bot put them infront of a pillar and make them shoot each other you'd think one of them would run out and be gunned down but no the expert difficult bot will just wallbang the guy into his head while the other cant seem to even hit a idle and flash banged enemy

while playing the game you will learn a couple of things
1 shield is your best friend they wont shoot just stare at you and wait to be gunned down hopefully
2 your teammates are braindead and can even walk or get stuck in everything
3 hostages are braindead and do the same
4 the enemy bots can and will 1 tap you with a glock from across the map when you have full armour
5 the devs didnt give a shit about test playing higher difficulties
6 how to abuse bugs to pass a single annoying challenge
fun fact you cant pass a mission without completing all the challenges which resoults in 20-3s in your favour because you need to get that 45 second or less win but the bots refuse to go into one place

condition zero deleted scenes
the game is a shining light of sorts most get the game because of deleted scenes because guess what its actually balanced on hard difficulty unlike condition zero and is fun because its balanced other than that they actually thought about making it good"

887,"Definitely late to the party on playing this version of Counter Strike but I found Condition Zero to be fun, enjoyable, with a somewhat active player base still and definitely did not regret sinking some hours into this game. If you are looking for the best Counter Strike experience I definitely wouldn't start here as I still find CSGO to be the best version of the game currently, but if you are looking for nostalgia and to play through all the games as a super fan though, you will have a lot of fun!"

900,"While condition zero on it's own is pretty MEH/OK, I can't say the same about the Deleted Scenes.

CS:CZ is just CS:1.6 with annoying challenges with bots so I will only talk about CS:CZ:DS

The deleted scenes are CRIMINALLY underrated, it's like combining Half-Life Opposing Force, Counter strike and a bit of CoD:MW (which didn't exist at the time). 
So I will just talk about the DS

901,"Fantastic game, well balanced and classic online FPS gameplay. 
A gem to own, one of my childhood favorites"
902,"The game is pretty good. But.... the players here are so friendly that they love your whole family. Here you can find your dad, and find out who took your mom to the movies. It's where 10-year-old geniuses from all over the world teach you about life, and help you build up your vocabulary. It's where your patience and stamina are tested. Here you can learn several languages. This is where the crayfish winters. This is where you're a king and a god, if your mother gave you a microphone. This is the place for you, and your clammy teammates!))))"
903,"the highly customizable single-player mission, messing directly with the BOTs, and ""low-end"" requirements make this game a good refresher if you're tired of playing competitively in the other titles. its classic mechanics is nostalgic and spray pattern? I don't think CS:CZ has any AFAIK."
904,This isn't worth the time investment to be honest. The single-player is riddled with confusing maps and bad bots. Play 1.6 if you want multiplayer.

923,"I personally think this game is way better than 1.6. It's like a small remaster, or a remake if I may say so, of CS 1.6, having better looking and higher resolution textures, updated player models, view-models and maps. Additionally, it comes with an extra game, that being the CS:CZ Deleted Scenes, a very nice single player campaign game."

934,"No reason to play the multiplayer over 1.6, CSS, or CSGO. The campaign of the main game (the one that doesn't have ""deleted scenes"" in the name) is awful. Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes is the game you want to play; it actually has fun missions and makes this game worth the purchase."
935,"Very nice game bought like the valve complete pack for 4 dollars 
has a very nice storyline and has tons of missions!
such a classic!!"

948,"COUNTER-STRIKE: CONDITION ZERO - Counter-Strike, the one Esport where players have peace of mind in celebrating the fact that the sport is PLAY TO WIN, not PAY TO WIN. as in another Counter-Strike review that i previously wrote, i must say here again that the only variance is skill. Although there are not as many servers in CS: CZ as there are in other Counter-Strike games, this game is a nostalgic, addictive and quite fun Online Action FPS game. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is, to me, one of those rare Multiplayer online action games where you are driven by the perfection you are immersing yourself in. 
Think CS V1.6 meets excitement and addiction, as opposed to religion and competition. - Deokumar Gandharry"

962,"Just like the old days. Happy that these games are still available to play,nostalgic moments you get when you play with your old mates again."
963,"As a casual player, I like it. It feels like 1.6 with bots, more maps, a campaign, some improved graphics, etc.

Apparently it's worse than 1.6 for more pro players, but if you're just playing casually especially against bots I doubt you'll notice."
964,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and the Deleted Scenes merge the fun of Counter Strike with the strategy of Half Life. 

Counter Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes comes bundled with the game, which adds a great campaign. The AI in Condition Zero was revolutionary for the time, and still holds up today. I hope that Valve remasters CS: CZ, as it was some of the most fun I have ever had.

Overall, I'd rate CS: CZ and CS: CZ DS 8.5/10 - The gameplay is enjoyable, even when you are losing, and the campaign is one of the best that I have ever played."

1001,Contains a lot of memories of my Childhood. It was one of the only games I had a couple years back. I didn't had Internet back then and was playing on a crappy laptop. This game never disappointed me. I played it every day and played every map many times. The expert bots can kill you in a matter of milliseconds. Nostalgic Times.

1008,"To start out, I've really got more like five hundred hours in this game. I started playing it obsessively long before Valve thought to add playtime records.

It's fun.

The bots are fairly competent as long as you disallow them from buying grenades and the list of maps that come prepackaged far outstrips that of the original Counter-Strike. (They're also far prettier, at least as much as they can be on the GoldSrc engine). Hostages are, as always, somewhat brain-dead, but they're nowhere near as bad as the ones in Counter-Strike: Source--although the fact they all wear identical orange jumpsuits makes me wonder who really are the good and bad guys. Isn't variety the spice of life?
Sound design and quality are improved slightly from the original game and many of the less generic maps lack that kitchen_rats look that's become so indicative of Half-Life's engine, so that's a plus. At the same time, a lot of maps have odd collision detection issues and I'm somewhat bothered by the fact that Counter-Terrorists are as chatty over the radio as their criminal counterparts."

1045,fun game
1046,<3
1047,h
1048,"I would say I feel the same about this game as I do with the first Counter-Strike. It has the same feel and vibe. I like Valves attempt at a campaign for an online game. Apart from the first Titanfall, I can't really think of any other game that has done this. Very unique. I had a bit of a problem setting up my loadout and character, but this was because it was my first time playing. Very good. 9/10"
1049,"its a pretty decent game to play, the hit boxes are a little better then cs, the only thing that sucks is that the game has a small online community."
1050,Got me through times without internet via very satisfying bot A.I.  Solid as hell shooting like Counter-Strike is known for.  A simple set-up for short matches and limited rounds to keep the maps rotating combined with the right difficulty selection makes it right.

1075,"(Played a lot before Steam.)
The worst version of CS. Yet they packaged the best version with it."
1076,"The truth? If you can handle the truth. This is more of a collectors item at this point in time. Paid for game before it came out. No regrets. Source was performing poorly on week old 2 grand of hardware in it's debut just to see drunken rag doll physics and less than 20 frames per second whereas this I had 200. The bots can get a little manic over the radio. When you buy armor it makes some weird squeak. If the bots do not know the map it kicks all players in vintage style instead of calculate without kicks like more modern work. Back then it was very nice and is now still acceptable work looking back at how many way-points I made.  Joe bots were the best. They took orders and did not go off into AI tangents spamming the radio panicking making weird whistle squeak sighs and stuff. I've never bothered to test their voice synthesis capabilities. Hearing Sam do the national anthem in the 1980's and getting this 20 years later was a bit of a prank. Horrible voice work in some areas. Condition Zero comes across as a map and skin pack, built-in bots and single player which is great for those offline. It works as multiplayer also. The physics are slightly different and the weapons cannot be sighted in properly. At one point got head shots for a month straight now hardly ever get them. There is no way I can change that much. I make my own weapons, no spread. Dead on. So like all FPS. Double-tap! Short bursts. The chest gets headshots now? Odd."

1086,yes

Seriously, git tis, it's gud.

Tour of Duty, and the Deleted Scenes campaign are very gud.

Get it, git gud."
1120,Very good game. If you like CS go play
1121,"My craptop suck nuts and cant run cs source properly, and 1.6 is filled with veterans and hackers, so condition zero is the sweet spot for me. I fire it up from time to time to play offline against bots. The bots are challenging and fun in higher difficulty levels and you can also download custom maps. It also has an okayish singleplayer campaign but who cares about it in the end. Got it on sale, didnt regret it."
1122,"It's really worth it for the singleplayer content.
Yes, It's a bit dated, but the fun is still present.
I enjoyed playing through the campaign maps.
The smooth gameplay was really the best part.
Even the graphics look 'crisp' enough to enjoy.
I'd say it's a good grab during the steam sales.
The newcomers might not like it as much, tho.
My review is fueled with the nostalgia aspects.
This game is clearly meant for the old-school.
I don't have anything negative to say, so yea.
This game truly deserves my positive review."
1123,i guess its good
1124,"When counter strike 1.6 came out, it came out as a mod, lots of people started trying it out, now its a official game.
But if you own counter strike 1.6 why should you get this game?
Well Condition zero is counter strike source mixed with counter strike 1.6 .


+ Gameplay :
The Gameplay is improved from CS 1.6 because maps have much better graphics, and there is condition zero deleted scenes, for just some single player fun.


+ Sound :
Sound hasn't been much of a problem in counter strike, it hasn't been a problem because all the the weapons make proper shooting and reloading sounds. When you kill someone the sound you get is awesome.
When you switch teams the noise you get is absolutely realistic, and its awesome, you get the whole dying effect.


+ Graphics :
The graphics still use the half life 1 engine, but the textures, models, weapons and maps have got much better graphics."

1139,"This is the ideal Counter-Strike game. You may not like it but this is what peak counter terrorism looks like.

In all honesty, Condition Zero is actually my favorite CS. Millenials would probably say either 1.6 or Source is their favorite and zoomers would say it's CS:GO. So why the fuck am I saying it's Condition Zero for me? Well I always liked to play with bots because I was, and most definitely still am too shit for PvP, but 1.6 didn't have them integrated and my old ass PC from eons ago could not run CS:S. That's not a joke, I did not have the RAM nor GPU to actually be capable of running Source games, so my best option was to play CZ. The CT bots I enlisted to my team along the way in my many Tours of Duty were my compatriots. Gus, Kenny, Kent, Travis, Maverick, Rooster, Brent. These bots with the attention span of a goldfish fought by my side through many battles across the world against those terrorists always up to no good, planting bombs and taking hostages.

Ok now that I'm done with the Vietnam nostalgia part is is honestly the sole reason for me loving this game, let's shit on it. 
Condition Zero's AI and the game itself can really be janky as hell. Your team bots will probably not listen to you even more than the CS:GO bots already don't, and their pathfinding can be especially scuffed at times and lead to a lot of lost battles. I have far too many tales of events like this happening in maps like Militia. On top of that there's also a few little things like bots not attempting to refuse the bomb unless you're already dead (even if there are no T's left) and them fucking up the defusal process as if they were a player constantly pressing and letting go of the button.

Despite those issues, I still can't help but love CZ above all others, it's just fun. No Just the peaceful robotic sounds of ""No sir."" ""Uhhh negative"" ""Nnnnope"", followed by a lot of death choking and the many ""and that's how it's done"", ""way to be team"" and  ""whoo""'s of victory.

tl;dr I'm a fucking anomaly that thinks Condition Zero is the best CS game."
1140,boring and repetitive
1141,zd
1142,I like this version because the bots don't yell at me for being bad at the game
1143,I like this game only because it has bot support.
1144,One of very few games I have known to let you play with bots.
1145,nothing to lose ^^
1146,A true classic.
1147,cum
1148,Good old game
1149,"Good game. 

A lot of people really don't enjoy Condition Zero that much, but honestly? It's pretty great."
1150,Best game ever made :)
1151,"DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS OR VANILLA CS AS THEY ARE NOT SUPPORTED AND WILL NOT EVEN OPEN!
I bought this as part of Counter Strike Complete as I wanted to play CS Condition Zero (Complete includes CS, CS Condition Zero and CS Source).
Both CS and CS CZ will not even open and run after lots of searching and trying to report a fault it became evident that STEAM DO NOT SUPPORT CS OR CS CZ.
I played CS Source on the day of purchase for a several hours which seems to play without any problems for me on Linux Steam.
Tried on the following day to get vanilla CS and CS CZ running to no avail and unable to get support from Steam, after searching online it became evident that nobody is supporting vanilla CS or CS CZ.
This begs the question why steam are selling a product which doesn't work and that they offer no support for (and neither does anyone else).
To make matters worse, when I requested a refund less than 24 after purchasing the CS Complete pack I received and email stating that as I played the purchase for more than 2 hours that my request for a refund was refused (well in fairness I had played a third of it for more than 2 hours as two thirds of the pack does not work at all).
If CS and CS CZ doesn't work then for pity sake steam, STOP SELLING IT - THIS MAKES YOU LOOK QUESTIONABLE TO SAY THE LEAST.
MY ADVICE IS BY ALL MEANS BUY CS SOURCE IF THAT IS YOUR THING BUT TO STAY WELL AWAY FROM ANY CS PACK WHICH CONTAINS NON SOURCE ELEMENTS."

There are cool features like improved lighting a detailed layer for textures but yeah just play 1.6!

1158,good game
1159,THE ONLY reason I didn't smash down a no is deleted scenes its just do fun.
1160,"lets keep this simple
 -pros
 if you have no friends (like me) it is very good because it has a singleplayer campaightnnghgn
 ai is dogshit sometimes (enemies in easy shooting positions)
 ai calls stuff out and that's kind of neat
 it's counter strike
 has the multiplayer built in i think

-cons
 ai is dogshit sometimes. like standing infront of you while you try to shoot an enemy, or run into a smg with a pistol
 your teammates are always shittier than the terrorists
 counter strike"

1173,as good as cs go - works for low-spec pc's
1174,Hours and hours of fun!!
1175,bots
1176,cs 1.6 2 (featuring bots)
1177,This is the best goldsrc counter strike you can get! instead of 1.6. it just makes single player more fun and intense instead of just playing single player you can also set up a server to play with you friend and bots! Instead of just killing bots in single player you have tasks to do like for example kill 8 terrorists with a night hawk aka deagle its just much more fun to play! and it has better models! like weapons look even nicer and the ct and t models look much better! but the worst part about the hd models in the leet crew instead of being this sick nerd with a jacket you have to be this weird guy that does not have anything to do with the original leet it is still better than any other goldsrc counter strike its even better than cs source single player! they also made even better maps! like for example the maps have these little roofs and dust 2 has a rug at cat. if there is anything i missed tell me in the comments.

1186,Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is great I like it
1187,I like it. The single player campaign is awful but but it has more multiplayer content compared to the original. No matter what if you are buying the original then you get this with the original. Over all this is still a good game and is enjoyable.
1188,Good game if you don't have friends to play with
1189,eh its cs
1190,CSGO should create standalone campaign mode like this one
1191,Very good game. I like it!!

1194,I thing its the best single player cs ever.
1195,very good game!!
1196,not the best classic cs is much better campaign is super trash and just very boring and not fun at all
1197,"Very fun to play with friends, with things to occupy yourself instead of a regular death-match"
1198,Only thing great about this game it has a built in bots that join your game when you create one .
1199,"OH BOY! This review is gonna be split into 2 parts. The first about the main game and the second about the deleted scenes.

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, at its surface is just Counter-Strike. But after that the game is actually Counter-Strike, but with more stuff. You get a short campaign that is literally just starting an offline match with bots. The only positive thing about the campaign is that I like the AI and how you set up the crew. I know I don't have much playtime and that's because I didn't bother finishing the ""Campaign"". And it's just Counter-Strike with the multiplayer.

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes is Condition Zero's older and cooler brother. It has an actual interesting series of missions. While it lacks multiplayer, whether that be because it focuses on the campaign or because its incomplete. I would honestly recommend this game just for deleted scenes.

This game consists of textures for GMod, a campaign, a ""campaign"", multiplayer."
1200,the single player is surprisingly fun to complete
1201,great game
1202,[b] The forgotten and underrated Counter-Strike 1.7 update. [/b]
1203,this game make me nostalgia :')
1204,"An underrated Counter Strike game and it shouldn't be like that. First of all it is the only CS game that has a campaign.
Secondly, the campaign and the missions are very good and very surprising.
I think every CS fan(and every gamer in special) should play this CS, for at least once.

From me, 10/10.
I hope this helped you, thank you and take care."

1216,"u can treat CSCZ as the cs 1.6 with the bots, and u can have a warm up here, just choose the difficulty and start the games, 18 maps here, and ofc u need to complete some challenges required for passing the levels. That sounds really ez but actually no, i've only passed the normal mission cuz from the Hard mission it's gonna be some real hard shxt, so if u just wanna take the challenges, start from the hard one.
BUT one shxtty point that the bots always repeat their words, ja not ""sometimes"" but ""always"", and never stop, unless u activated a new phrase and it may start to repeat again... i could still handle it but maybe not for others..."

1229,GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
1230,"This game is very fun, there is many missions and you can choose any difficulity you like, the storyline is better than cyberpunk's, tho the developers and the map creators are shameless and self plug their website in the description of the different missions, furthermore the strategy of this game is elaborate consisting of whooping 3 abilities that you can choose from when creating your dream team. For example it can be brave shit, but CO:OP Good, and PS Cooper is the best bot just take him he will make your life easier. Thank you valve for the great game, realease half-life 3"

1234,"The weird bastard child of Counter-Strike. It went through a bunch of versions leading to it being released just before Counter-Strike Source, meaning it was immediately obsolete. It didn't offer much reason to buy it over 1.6 at the time either, with most of the new features being backported into that game as well.

The main reason to buy this nowadays is to check out Condition Zero Deleted Scenes, which is an incredibly odd single player campaign that can feel like a slog at times but has some really cool ideas. The icebreaker level and final level are especially cool.

Maybe don't buy this at full price (even if it is already cheap), since the main game itself isn't really worth it. If you do buy this, it should be purely as a curiousity for Deleted Scenes."
1235,I would love to give a Legendary Status to this game.
1236,fun
1237,:)
1238,fun I guess
1239,"This was the First Valve game I ever played. While still a bit primitive compared to Today's games, Counter-strike: CZ is still really fun to play.  

I was surprised that there was still an active community for this, although I didn't join any servers, and stuck mainly to Single player. The AI in the single player isn't the best, but they get the job done, and when push comes to shove, they can somewhat hold their own. Its cool that each one has a minor personality, being named, having a weapon of choice, and some stats to them. sure, they're idiots, but they're LOVABLE idiots. x3

The Single player consists of many different maps, with different objectives besides shooting the bad dudes, defusing the bomb, and rescuing people. For example, one map might require you to kill 5 people, and make sure one of those kills is with a shotgun. Another may ask you to kill a person, and win the round within a minute. all the while, you have to be winning more rounds than the bad dudes.

Overall, its not the polished game that is Global Offensive, but it hits the right notes, and is pretty fun, even if playing with the bots."
1240,"get gud

1241,"was a pretty cool game, it has a fun story mode, it is not that good in today's standarts but i like it"

It is because its graphics are realistic enough to enjoy the game to the fullest and it is not too much detailed as GO (as far as I watched in videos) to lose your focus on the actual game play. I have high respect to developers, and although they will probably not going to read this, I would like to thank every each one of them bringing back my high school memories every time I play."

1269,"Computer AI sucks. Sometimes they are not cooperating, sometimes they just score 0-4 with lvl 4 agents with each of his skill ""HIGH"". Maybe please redefine what does ""HIGH"" means in this game. Thanks!

Btw, no matter how many times I said I would NOT want a tutor, the game still ""kindly"" provide a detailed tutor to me.

P.S. Just to let your guys know, the retirement rate of this game was reached an astonishing rate of 40.84% till now.

:)

Update:
the game still sucks.

With countless trials and failures, I eventually beat this game in expert level.
Having AI teammates is just like owning the Schr√∂dinger's cat. Sometimes like Maverick and Steel, they can managed to kill 4 guys in a row. But others like Tex and Bear, they are just dumb as their names.

This game requires huge amount of determination and skill, and there isn't even an achievement system in here nor anything else that can reward player with."

1333,Better than GO
1334,First love is not forgotten. Cs go - a pathetic parody of Counter Strike 1.5/1.6.
1335,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is an expansion of Counter-Strike 1.6.

There are two primarily different games here: Condition Zero, and Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes (the latter of which I'm not going to go into.)

Condition Zero itself is an upgrade from classic CS. It has a singleplayer campaign system called Tour of Duty that can be modded in all sorts of ways. You can create campaign packs that have new allies for you to fight with, new enemies for you to face, an entirely different map order from the default Tour of Duty, or you can just outright create a completely new campaign with new maps and new allies and new enemies and new challenges.

Sadly, those are the primary selling points at this rate. The multiplayer playerbase, from what I've heard, is basically dead. It's not like I play on MP servers anyways: I absolutely SUCK at multiplayer FPSes."

1338,my fav childhood game

1340,<3
1341,CS:CZ was a good game!
1342,yeah pretty cool
1343,"Like cs 1.6, but with better animatons, singleplayer campaign, but dead playerbase.

Also valve. If you read this (which you prob won't), please add steam achievement to gold source engine games like this game for example. If counter strike online (on steam is nexon  studio) have achievements and trading cards, so some gold source engine games like this game can have.

This can bring much more players to the game.

Best regards."
1344,1.6 is better
1345,"Surprisingly fun and a good game, especially for being 16 almost 17 years old now.

A new Condition Zero CSGO-style would be awesome IMO."
1346,nice
1347,too many hackers.
1348,"Classic, I play this game Every other day.."
1349,Just Great even in 2020!
1350,lego city
1351,"My first game ever was CS:CZ which one of my cousins got for me, a cracked client. I spent countless hours in the game, since back then I did not have friends, or an internet connection to play with online, so I played the single player missions for hours on end. Nostalgia hit hard when I purchased a copy for myself and started playing it."
1352,Old school FPS at it's finest.
1353,"Now most people who play Counter-Strike grew up with 1.6. I grew up with Condition Zero. I had both games on our house PC but I spent 95% of my time on CZ. Why? Because it had bots, and fantastic ones at that. We didn't have internet at the time so most my time was spent killing bots over and over on different maps. We got internet access down the line but, considering the time, it was very slow. So I used to browse FPSBanana (now GameBanana) for hours looking for maps and skins to download and then waiting an excruciating amount of time for them to finish. I would then install them and it's almost playing a new game! When people ask me what my childhood was in term of games, very few games spring to mind. Need for Speed 2, Virtua Cop 2 and Condition Zero.

Now obviously, people say this is just a reskin of Counter-Strike 1.6 with bots, which it is. But the fact that it is, makes it so much better for me. Who wouldn't want Counter-Strike 1.6 with better skins, models and textures? AND bot support?

Should you play it now? Well if you're looking for quintessential old online Counter-Strike experience, you should go with Counter-Strike 1.6, as its community is still thriving and is more active than CZ. If you want the most active Counter-Strike scene, CSGO is your place to go. If you're looking for the best single-player experience with community mods, maps and skins, or if you're stuck at home with no internet, which I wonder how you're reading this in the first place, Source is your game, since CSGO has limited moddability. But it doesn't mean you shouldn't give this a try, even if you're just buying this to complete your Counter-Strike collection, in which case you would already have this in your library. Condition Zero is essentially single-player CS1.6, and if that interests you then by all means!"
1354,"Even though it's old, for me it's the first experience that was great, as you see 7h of nonstop playing is saying something, learning all the key binds and such, isn't hard at all, bought with cs bundle.

Basically, recommended."
1355, VBNBVNVBNVB
1356,"This game's singleplayer mode is pretty good. I don't know about multiplayer, though."
1357,Good
1358,Amaaaaaaazzzzziiiiiinnnggggggg! Only for nostalgic multiplayer though
1359,You can shoot people in it
1360,"this game is good !


"
1361,"Old but gold, should have born earlier."
1362,Si jocu asta a fost candva foarte fain!! :3
1363,"So I've only played the original CS for like 5 minutes so I can't really make any comparisons between that and CZ. This game is fun. I haven't played multiplayer yet. I've just been enjoying the gameplay for the solo missions. It feels kind of like the original Rainbow Six for the PS1. Good buy, so is CZ: Deleted Scenes."
1364,Yes Good Gam
1365,Better than sex
1366,"It's been 20 years since I started playing CS... my computer is still rather old, so can't play nearly as well the latest GO versions. CS:CZ works pretty well in my 2012 Mac Mini
"
1367,I can recommend it!
1368,Not good as CS 1.6 4/10 only bcs missions
1369,Gud
1370,"Its just kinda meh.

I understand if someone likes to play this for the nostalgia factor but the missions are just kinda meh in every way.
not recommended at full price. Buy in sale!"
1371,good campaign
1372,ye
1373,the best csgo
1374,good
1375,1.6 but better it has also a campaign and public servers.
1376,very very easy and simple
1377,"Probably the most underrated counter strike game of the whole series and also the only counter strike game with a great single player campaign with challenging bots that will definitely test your skills and quick reactions , it's definitely still worth purchasing because of the campaign itself and also the great multiplayer and online mode which is always active , definitely go for it if you love FPS games , you will never get bored of it as it will never be quite easy even if you are a typical freak in FPS games."
1378,Community servers are kinda dead. I mostly just play this with my gf on a LAN game with bots. Lots of fun regardless.
1379,gmae
1380,super !!!
1381,with bots
1382,All round solid FPS game that has stood the test of time. Not many people playing this old game now but those that do have been playing for years and keep coming back as I do.
1383,I love this game.
1384,yeeee
1385,I wrote a negative review of this product because it is a very bad product.
1386,lol nsb
1387,"Why do i have 3 hours on this and only 87 minutes on source? Smh.

1388,ok cs game

1391,Very cool! Bot Bob top frag.
1392,Classics. Missions are good. Definitely  better then the CS 1.6.
1393,"what the fuck did i saw, my old review is cringe, just check this one instead



good game."
1394,"Actually very good. I like the Missions.

It's some time now since i did it.. But Completing it on the Expert, with the Bot-Team, took quite some time.. xD

Mostly, because... It's botZ!. :D"

1401,"good game 
single campaign with arcade thing... 
no achievs
no cards.. 
feel like this game is forgotten"
1402,the game is the best hands down
1403,10/10 made me cook food
1404,Yes so game i have Counter Strike
1405,EPIC GAME
1406,so cool~
1407,pretty good i guess
1408,Anime boobs are shown on maps
1409,"It¬¥s okay to play, underrated game."
1410,pretty fun when bored and is also a slight touch up from goldsrc as it came out 6 months before source and uses upgraded versions of the maps.
1411,"The zombie server is very gud
"
1412,worst cs game
1413,Classic
1414,beast
1415,"The problem is that neither the physics nor the graphics have aged particularly well; if you're looking for a next-gen FPS, this is not it. It is, however, a decent update to one of the best titles of yesterday."

1417,"(Review of Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes)

OK if bought in a bundle that includes other Valve titles, but not worth the money if bought separately: The game lacks the usual Valve polish and can only offer uninspired gameplay, poor scripted events, and occasional bugs. To my mind, the ""Single-player Counter-Strike"" formula doesn't work: The development team should've tweaked the gameplay so that it wouldn't feel like a regular bot match."
1418,"800h on it , +/- 20yo game but still fun with the old good community :)"

The only downside about this game is that the AI are really stupid, and can't aim. I have also found that the ""Kill 3 enemies with a tactical shield"" challenge is a bit bugged, as only some of the kills count. overall, i highly reccomend this game, 10/10."

1517,This is really nice game. I've played a lot of hours in CS:CZ and CS1.6 and I think these games are better than popular CS:GO.
1518,classic :)
1519,Why even get CSGO when this is still available
1520,"There's a certain cold, functional simplicity to this campaign which in any other IP might just feel ""generic"" but somehow feels right at home with the Counter-Strike name - it really does feel like a Counter-Strike story mode through and through. I don't think this game will really blow you away necessarily, but it's a very enjoyable experience with a certain comfy feeling to playing it."
1521,played since middle school...never gets old
1522,fun but my brother refunded it because it had alot of pixels and to big for the screen but it still works i loved it
1523,good

1528,"Nostalgia is a powerful emotion. This game was one of the first I played on PC and was the catalyst for me searching out Counter Strike: Source and creating my Steam account. I remember spending many hours trying to grind out challenges, only for my AI teammates to seemingly throw rounds to keep me playing. It hasn't changed a bit and I wouldn't ever want it to. No regrets picking this up, highly recommend."
1529,Best single view but multiplayer game in the world

1568,fun play just to shoot stuff
1569,It's CS 1.6 but with higher quality models and textures. Still uses gldsrc engine.
1570,I love it!
1571,Maverick is the MVP of Condition Zero
1572,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero takes the classic gameplay from the original and cranks it up a notch with updated character models, weapons, and map textures. Many of the original maps felt like new and even the sounds were changed. While some of those changes were not necessarily better for the game, the concept of a new Counter-Strike at the time was really exciting to me. One of the most interesting parts about this release is that it included a single-player campaign. It's age definitely shows now but there are some hilariously silly moments in that campaign because of a few glitches and animation hiccups. This game doesn't hold up well due to its low player base but I will always remember the fun I had, especially when I ran one of the few active surf servers from the time. If you are looking for a piece of Counter-Strike history to remind you of how things used to be, then Condition Zero is no less than that. Game on."
1573,My dad really likes this game
1574,Nice time killer.
1575,This game led to cs:s and  cs:go so I WONT knock it too hard. But really it's oh so bad. But if you play it and you gain a GOLD MEDAL then you are honestly a pro cs gamer!
1576,VERY NICE !!!!. (THE HOSTAGES ARE TOO SISSY BUT)
1577,"Playing since college, love at first sight."
1578,‚Äé
1579,<3 since 2000
1580,"It is an excellent game which is running OpenGL game engine that is much faster than DirectX games. This game is very similar to CS 1.6 and it is easy to play but its graphic is better than CS 1.6.

I think I will never get tired on this game. Highly recommend!"
1581,Great game. Decent Campaign and multiplayer is good.
1582,nice game
1583,"If anything, the single player experience is extremely fun to play. The condition zero missions are very cool and there are custom ones to download as well!"

1586,classic cs was more fun than csgo even with bots. the actual drug of fps lovers
1587,gud
1588,decent but I still prefer source
1589,its a very good game i played it for like 15 years.
1590,I really prefer CS 1.6 over this.
1591,"Single player counter-strike experience, with multiplayer component? Nostalgic, worth the pennies you pay for it in the Valve Bundle on Christmas."
1592,"mod it, good for health"
1593,better than global offensive
1594,Good old game.  :)
1595,Good
1596,"Old school game that is still fun.


Now that i have wasted many hours of my life after this game was huge, i would say stay away LOL. Cs GO is SO MUCH better. I would keep 1.6 and csgo and delete this version. only like 10-18 servers with people playing."
1597,gut.
1598,Mam this is the one of the best game ive played when i was having a internet problem but it was a great game to play with
1599,Its a nice game to practice playing before CS Go. Boats here are really expert can play at per with human. They have good skill and intelligence. Its a nice game to become pro in counter strike. Good thing one can play offline. Good for refreshment after work.

1608,Classic format. Fun and no pay to play to fuck with actual skilled players
1609,It is really old school and get it when its on sale. I would say get this game if you have a bad computer or just want to have nostalgia. Its good and brings a lot of fun but try looking at other games first.
1610,this game owns
1611,"Good gaem
"
1612,it ok
1613,really old game but stiil very good.
1614,Is fun. Fast casual fun in single player and multiplayer is just like CS 1.6 but with a bit of a special flavor
1615,"I highly recommend this game because i was able to build my Dream Team with P90's and Igor was on lead. I'm so proud of him... He know how to use P90 like a real pro. If you will be building up your team, don't forget about him. That guy will save your entire match. Igor deserves to be mentioned in my review. He is the real MVP.

Works, is still fun to play, nice sounds, classic"
1631,"Very Fun Game, Would Recommend To Play This Game."
1632,"This is without a doubt my favorite game in the Counter-Strike series. I've liked CS ever since I was first introduced to it (rather late, circa 2007). The thing is, I always preferred playing with bots or via LAN with people I knew (ideally in co-op against bots!) instead of having to deal with toxicity of online players and shaky Internet connection.

Then I discovered CS:CZ, a full-fledged Counter-Strike, but with extra single-player components. Introduction of bots was nothing new to me, because I was already familiar with Source (where bots were present), though bots must have been a great new feature back when the only CS was 1.6. It's worth to mention that bots in CS:CZ are actually very good, I wouldn't be surprised if Normal difficulty in CZ was harder than Expert in CS:GO. I spent a lot of time playing the Tour of Duty campaign and a-little-bit-generic-but-fun-anyway Deleted Scenes, which other CS games never offered.

What about multiplayer, though? Well, as I said, it's a full-fledged Counter-Strike. The multiplayer component is still there, almost the same as in the 1.6 iteration, but better. Improvements from 1.6 include better graphics, customizable weapon loadouts (you don't need to type 43828383 everytime you want to get your regular loadout anymore!), one extra faction (skin) per side and the aforementioned bots. Unfortunately, CZ is lacking in the most important aspect of multiplayer: players. With the game being very much forgotten, it doesn't have nearly as many players as CS 1.6. If I were to choose CS:CZ or 1.6 for a multiplayer match on LAN, however, I'd go with CZ any day.

Condition Zero is basically an expansion pack to 1.6, focusing a lot on single-player, but also polishing the classic multiplayer experience along the way. It fills a niche no other game in the series does by catering to solo players.

Sorry, CS:GO. You're just not my type."
1633,Imagine a Counter Strike game with storyline. That is exactely what this game is about. Upgrade your team and face new missions on several places around the world with this classic FPS game. grapphics are apropriate for the era and the gameplay is impecable. It is a remarkable and fine example on how counter strike should adapt storyline with the competitivety on its matches. I recommend it.
1634,OLD But [G]OLD
1635,I had not played this game for a long time. I bought it originally around the time that half life 2 came out. I enjoyed it more then because I was younger and was into first person shooters more. I installed it today from steam. I didn't expect it to work because of its age. It works really good. It even let me set it to 1920 by 1080p just by the settings in the menu. I installed this to play against bots. Not really interested in online multiplayer. I am not very good at it. I installed this version because it takes up less room on my hard drive than counter strike go. It works well and is fun for me for these purposes. The control options are good with a mouse and keyboard. The graphics look good for its age.
1636,childhood memories
1637,nice game D:
1638,i like valve games :)
1639,"Condition-Zero is the expansion to the original 1.6 experience. While not as accomplished as 1.6, this is still a competent game with re-designs of original maps and new guns, skins. Servers are kinda dead so I would recommend sticking to the orignal, but for completions sake it is a competent and well done game.
7/10"
1640,Call Of Duty Condition Zero.
1641,Classic 3D shooter with basic goals and bot enemies
1642,"CS:CZ is like that first girlfriend, You will always remember them and have a special place in your heart for them."
1643,yes
1644,"It's like the classic 1.6 you'd know and love, with enhanced graphics and a ""tour of duty"" mode that pits you against bots of varying degrees of challenge. Be warned, the expert bots are like skilled human players (always going for headshots and such)
You can also make your own campaigns quite easily"
1645,legend
1646,CS 1.6 but for introverts
1647,Pretty much 1.6 with bot support
1648,Almost that first CS that I played first time...
1649,"Condition Zero is the dark horse of the franchise. It was meant to be a Counter-Strike game with a proper single player experience, but sadly, the development hell it went through made that very hard.
In itself, it is not a very innovative game: the graphics are average (especially compared to CS: Source which was released shortly after) and the shooting mechanics don't change that much from CS1.6. But if you want some single player experience, then this is the best game of the series.
The single player campaigns are interesting, atmospheric and challenging. Some gameplay mechanics and graphic features also improved, though not very significantly. The additional missions in Deleted Scenes are also quite a nice bonus. Overall, the game is quite good, despite not improving much in a gameplay and visuals, and you still get a game with a nice multiplayer mode.
It is not a mind-blowing game, but Condition Zero might be fun for people who are looking for a more casual and solitary Counter-Strike experience."
1650,"Like 1.6, slightly better looking with QOL improvements"
1651,I liked the solo mode player
1652,This is really fun idk why people dislike this
1653,"Still one of the games that I come back to when I get bored of any others. Yes there are much better games available including PUBG, Fortnite and CSGO but this remains my first love in FPS."
1654,Why the game will jump out to the windows and it is laggy
1655,All time classic.
1656,Classic and unique CS series
1657,oldtimes
1658,"this game is pretty great, although the multiplayer itself not as good as its successor, but the Singleplayer thing is really good. 

as for condition zero deleted scenes itself, it's really good though, but it's hard as heck even if it's on easy difficulty."
1659,terrorist solo would be nice but eh its still good
1660,"Is game has an great community and that is what this game is all about. You don't play this game for the graphics nor the mechanics. Considering how old this game is, it's surprising how good of a community it still has, an absolute banger for the buck when it costs only 1$ when at sale."

My knee bends, and I lean on the door frame.
Symbolic.
I'm leaning on this community again.
She rushes towards me.
And like a child I stop her.
Some dignity. Please.
I didn't choose this Condition.
And there are Zero individuals here that know how to treat it.
There used to be around 3 thousand in the community with this condition.
Now.
A little under 800.
She knows this.

She asks.
You're complaining, but why did you stay here for so long?

No.

I drink the last of my Eagle Rare.
I toss it at my Counter.
The Strike it makes is dull.
I wipe my mouth.
And continue.

And this condition is what taught me.
I even found my companion.
Her face morphs from sad, to confusion, to wonder.
Before she asks, I know the words.
And whistle and yell, ""Come'ere Bull.""
A pup darts out from the back office.
And sits in front of me.
My good boy.
Her face seems solemn.
[h1] Did you Ever Finish Your Missions [/h1]
She asks.
I nod, and lift the pup into my arm.
I did.
They wanted an Expert.
And I did it.
It was fun. 
It felt near impossible at points.
But it was fun. 
I say turning back towards the door.
Can I at least walk with you?
She begs.
Sure, but...
[h1] I Don't Know What More to Say[/h1]
We begin to walk.
We reminisce about our younger years.
What brought us here.
Snoop Dogg's Drop it Like it's Hot.
A kid screaming to get off him.
Some Flavour.
There's silence.
Do you honestly think you'll return.
I chuckle.
But a sudden wave of realization flows over me.
I pass the pup to her.
I run back to my office.
I forgot.
I hadn't Deleted the Scenes
[h1] I Reach my Office [/h1]
I was so stressed, the keys dropped as soon as I opened the doors.
The computer illuminating the darkness in the office.
I delete every scene, the case is closed.
I finished my missions, but I'm not doing the paperwork.
I hear my door close.
Janitor.
Noise begins outside.
I walk to my door.
Locked.
I reach for my pocket.
Empty.
The keys are on the other side of the door. 
What kind of world must this be, for something as soft as this.
To lock me out.
Disappointment sets in.
The noise outside is louder.
I walk over to my window.
The mods.
They're back.
I never did find out where the source was.

1715,"This is the greatest Counter-Strike game in the series. You have the awesome gameplay of 1.6 with extra content. A single player campaing, challenge mode, bots, two new characters to play as, and new maps. Yes, this has a single player component, which was sadly not brought back for CS: Source and Global Offensive. It's great, and underappreciated. It's not as linear as many seem to say, but it's still a bit linear. There's bonus missions available in the world map, so it's not over once you finish the main ones. It's a very good experience, and one you should definitely play.

As I said, the game has new maps. It also has new versions of 1.6 maps, along with their original incarnations. If you prefer 1.6's Italy, it's right there for you. Of course like 1.6, you can download custom maps to play on. There's a ton to choose from online. This game has a challenge mode called Condition Zero. You choose a map and select your teammates. It's a ton of fun. Like with multiplayer maps, you can download custom challenges. 

Definitely get Condition Zero. It's a complete package that's spectacular. :D"
1716,Fun

1722,"I don't know what to say about condition zero....
It dosen't have players and that's a big -
I mean it's not the game fault, but this game is  just Counter-Strike 1.6
Nothing special, but since it's tehnically free, you buy 1.6 and get this in a pack.
Dosen't worth wasting time, but I will give a positive review."
1723,"I'm not going to shit on Counter Strike: Condition Zero. It was probably too late (even if it was released on time) to be any kind of retail replacement of the original mod. [i]Like, they invented Steam so they could patch Counter-Strike automatically.[/i] Furthermore, CZ was shuffled around to various developers, blah blah, and was basically used as some kind of business bargaining chip in the later days of the Valve/Sierra entanglement. See the NoClip Half-Life documentary for that.

I didn't really dig the Q3A style bot match part of the main product, and I don't think I've ever hopped on a CZ server. Nicer graphics aside, I don't think anyone would want to have two competing versions of (GoldSRC) Counter Strike, and they should have just shipped the single player stuff, now known as the 'deleted scenes'.

The deleted scenes are what you should take a look at. It is some damn fine looking GoldSrc. Awesome geometry and clean texture alignment abounds, in realistic looking environments. I haven't played some of the great GoldSrc mods yet, but I've played enough to be really impressed with what I saw. While the texture resolution isn't as high as you would like, it's all detailed and proportionate. Pick it up for 5$.

1725,"[h1] Counter-Strike: Condition Zero [/h1]

An Iconic title among the line of the legendary series of Counterstrike games. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero (CS: CZ) a first-person shooter, action, multiplayer video game and the sequel to the original Counter-Strike. The game was released in 2004 via both retail stores and Steam and uses the GoldSrc engine. Published and developed by Valve. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1906154053

Unlike other Counter-Strike games Counter-Strike: Condition Zero (CS: CZ) comes with a single-player mission pack with the player unlocking maps and more. 

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was originally designed to introduce a single-player Counter-Strike experience and therefore it has more in-depth single-player modes available than other entries in the series. In addition to two different single-player modes, the traditional multiplayer mode is also available

Even after 16 years of lifetime, this game still gets a daily player count, Which surprises me every time I look at that player stat. 

The gameplay I anything to write home about after so many years and playing throw all the Counterstrike titles, but The gameplay still holds up somewhat. 
Counter-Strike: Condition Zero (CS: CZ) was never a perfect game but it did its job well of entertaining us over the years. 
The game has many issues but the nostalgia punch never lets me focus on that. But which might bother someone whose not a fan.

If you're a fan of the Counter-Strike line up, I would say give Counter-Strike: Condition Zero (CS: CZ) ago, you will enjoy this. 
This game still throws me back to my childhood me and my cousins kicking Bot asses in-game. 

Tho someone new to counter-strike won't care about Counter-Strike: Condition Zero (CS: CZ) but this game will always have a special place in my heart.

1731,"What a wonderful game, is really fun to play, and when the AI talk, it makes me feel like they are real persons and in some occasions, i speak to them like a stupid.

100% recommend it"
1732,the awesome graphics
1733,its fun ig
1734,hell yea B)))))))))))))))))))))))))))
1735,"Condition Zero is odd. Aside from graphical upgrades to the base game, it's basically just a reskin of the original Counter-Strike. If you already own the original Counter-Strike and want to try Condition Zero, you'll be left pretty disappointed as I was, since it's just that - a prettier reskin. The single player ""Tour of Duty"" mode is a novel concept but it just boils down to bot matches where you do mundane tasks. I'd love to see that concept revisited in CS:GO with the whole ""pick your team"" thing just have it more fleshed out and meaningful.

As for Condition Zero Deleted Scenes - it's an interesting way to spend your time. It's just anything ""fantastic"", definitely not, but Deleted Scenes is about the only time when Counter-Strike tried to have a sort of ""story mode"". You play through various missions playing for various factions like the Spetsnaz or the FBI, and you simply go through a linear map and clear objectives. It's an interesting idea but the execution is very wonky. Still, if you're itching for something different - give Condition Zero Deleted Scenes a shot!"

1757,"To start out, I've really got more like five hundred hours in this game. I started playing it obsessively long before Valve thought to add playtime records.

It's fun.

The bots are fairly competent as long as you disallow them from buying grenades and the list of maps that come prepackaged far outstrips that of the original Counter-Strike. (They're also far prettier, at least as much as they can be on the GoldSrc engine). Hostages are, as always, somewhat brain-dead, but they're nowhere near as bad as the ones in Counter-Strike: Source--although the fact they all wear identical orange jumpsuits makes me wonder who really are the good and bad guys. Isn't variety the spice of life?
Sound design and quality are improved slightly from the original game and many of the less generic maps lack that kitchen_rats look that's become so indicative of Half-Life's engine, so that's a plus. At the same time, a lot of maps have odd collision detection issues and I'm somewhat bothered by the fact that Counter-Terrorists are as chatty over the radio as their criminal counterparts."
1758,If this game wasn't permanently attached to my account I would've sworn it was just a fever dream I had in 2006.

1761,classic cs game i love it its damn cool
1762,"This is a review of Condition Zero - Deleted Scenes only. Original CS does not need a review - it is a legendary shooter, after all.

Imagine this - it's the beginning of the 2000s. War shooters are slowly becoming the new trend. And then Valve realises that and decides to cash in on their military franchise!
Condition Zero - Deleted Scenes was developed by Ritual Entertainment and released in 2004 to... OK reviews, to say the least. It is understandable - I mean, why would there be a single-player standalone game under the name of CS? The original game is not about the thrilling cinematics, great dialogue or the amazing plot - it's about improving yourself to be more skilled and simply having fun with friends or randoms through the internet.
Still, credit's where's credit's due, this game feels... OK to play today. I enjoyed spending my time with it, but part of the reason is because I actually wanted to beat this game during my childhood - I simply failed the stealth mission in Ventspils every single time. This time around, I didn't.
Besides having just the main missions, there are also ""bonus"" ones which you can access via the World Map section of the menu. There's nothing particularly special about them, just thought I'd note it.
Long story short, then - a simple game for its time which still feels good enough (at least for me) to play. There are worse ways to spend your money, trust me. I'd recommend buying this game on sale or with the Valve Complete Pack."
1763,"Such a cool game, whenever i want to have nostalgia I play this game for nostalgia"
1764,Pretty good
1765,god
1766,"it's a good game, especially deleted scenes. it's the same as cs 1.6 but with slightly better textures.. and it's also singleplayer. the ai is kinda trash though 

8/10"
1767,"[b]WORTH THE PRICE [/b]

This is the perfect game if you like the Counter-Strike franchise and wanna enjoy it on your own. It's a very nostalgic experience. The missions are good, they're not too easy and not too hard. The different difficulties allow you to improve your mechanics gradually as you play and not just struggle from start to end. The graphics are good (within what you would expect) and I especially like that they made it different from Counter-Strike 1.6 with new animations and looks on maps. If you get tired of the missions or just finish them all you can always just set up your own game with bots and not only choose from the CZ maps but also the original 1.6 ones!
The AI is obviously not perfect but it's what you would expect from a game this old AND it actually scales pretty well between difficulties. In expert mode you'll be getting hit by some insane headshots and the bots will 360 noscope you from miles away but it won't always happen, and with training you'll improve your mechanics enough that you can be faster and have a higher headshot percentage.

[b]So overall: It's an amazing game, definetely worth buying. You'll have a good time playing it and the few bugs or downsides are completely understandable due to the age of the game. Smooth gameplay. [/b]"

1781,"I've been playing Counter-Strike since Beta 3.0, which if memory serves was sometime in 1999.  Still playin' the game today.  It pretty much started what everyone else just replicates."
1782,"Interesting out-take, fun to play"
1783,something to play for fun after the multiplayer
1784,"nice

1785,"Counter Strike Condition Zero is a very good game with bots. However, Deleted Scenes is why you should consider picking up this title it has an immesenive campagin with amziang levels and voice acting a great masterpice."
1786,yes
1787,headshots arent fair and balaced
1788,good story but its old so some might not like it
1789,nice game :)
1790,"I like that CS:CZ brings two single player mode for those who like CS but don't like competition.
Tour of Duty features normal CS gameplay(with bots),with some condition must fulfill in the play.
Deleted Scenes ask you to complete the missions you choose,sometimes with special gears you can't seen in normal CS gameplay."
1791,"Condition zero franchise was shaded away because it was released the same year as source and half life 2 unfortunately. Living in the shadow of source it didn't got the attention it deserved and it got called out by community that it sucks. it becomes usual trend that people just say condition zero is lame without even trying it. This game has a Story campaign dedicated to it called ""deleted scenes"". The name is misleading thus many thought it's just normal condition zero but another version. The story campaign is just like a COD game but in Counter strike style, focusing on times where terrorism raged. It might sound bad but it can easily suck you in it with it's character development.  Gameplay is smooth although tbh it's an old game you may get frustrated in it but I never had problems running it on modern systems which is a really good aspect I might say. Each mission is located in different parts of the world where you are a different person assigned to certain mission to complete. It has smooth progress but in some parts although it is very very rare you might get confused. This game is worth every penny especially in sells. I am kind of disappointed that we didn't get another CS game like this. The deleted scenes alone is worth it. Now we get to the normal CS:CZ, it's improved CS 1.6 but didn't last long cause of source release. Valve killing their own game tbh. It's got fun CO-OP campaign missions where you assign a team from npcs which have their own cons and pros so you have to pay attention to that and go on vs terrorists and complete the challenges to progress, in each different map. This game has got so manyyyy maps! many you didn't get to experience in CSGO. It's worth playing in community servers for the sake of nostalegica, not other than that just like every game. Just imagine the whole thing as: Deleted scenes is the main game while normal CZ is a nice addition to it."
1792,"The campaign is pretty bad, it's actually good because it's bad. ""We could always throw icicle at intruder, HOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO""

the guns feel horrible though. wish they fixed that"
1793,Old school favorite!
1794,"Good old memories with this game. Because of this and Half Life addicted to computers in general. Great game to spend time with your buds or make new one's over the internet

1834,"[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review [/h1]

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a game developed and published by Valve, and is the sequel to the classic FPS shooter

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero overall, however, is a fun game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a very good action game and to play in short bursts

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

1839,"Condition Zero came out in March of 2004 after development since about 2000. Then Counter-Strike: Source came out in a handful of months. Also, Counter-Strike 1.6 had only just been released less than a year earlier and was still enjoying being one of the most popular online games ever, and would continue to be so for the rest of the decade.

So this game unfortunately was really overshadowed, despite being effectively 1.6 but with much-improved graphics and hit registration. The real gem here are the singleplayer modes. 

The first is ""Deleted Scenes"", a Half-Life-like singleplayer campaign in which you're a single counter-terrorist going on missions all over the world. It's a fantastic little campaign, a bit of Call of Duty 4 before its time, but unfortunately Deleted Scenes is just not worth playing unless you're on Hard or Nightmare (skill 0). On a higher difficulty the game actually begins to play like Counter-Strike: challenging, every resource counts, twitch aim mania. I have no idea if it was Valve who ruined the game's tuning and balance, but it's just ridiculously easy and boring on anything below Hard. 

The second is ""Tour of Duty"", and it's basically a large series of bot matches in which you go through each difficulty campaign at a time, building a team of counter-terrorists with unique attributes in order to fight terrorists on the classic CS maps, while meeting certain mission objectives (""Kill 4 enemies with the AUG""). This is actually pretty fun and amazing practice for actual online Counter-Strike.

Both campaigns are amazing and despite not being made by Valve (Ritual and Turtle Rock, respectively), are fantastic little experiences and great attempts at transforming Counter-Strike into a solo play experience. For this, the game is worth it even in 2020."
1840,Classic chilhood games
1841,cs 1.6 with better textures and bots
1842,not a bad remake
1843,gg
1844,Recommended to people that doesn't want to play with other human being and just simply wants to play with bot with different level skill.
1845,"TLDR: An underrated classic!

General info
‚ö™Ô∏è GENRE:  FPS PVP and PVE team and objective based
‚ö™Ô∏è GRAPHICS: Like OG CS but slightly better, typical beginning of 2000s game graphics 
‚ö™Ô∏è STATE: Fully released in 2004, still has a small community
‚ö™Ô∏è SOUNDTRACK: Typical shooter music with trumpets 

Pros
üü¢ Cool Tour Of Duty campaign mode with many missions and challenges 
üü¢ High variety of weapons and maps 
üü¢ Can be played both online and offline
üü¢ Easy to run
üü¢ Bots are quite smart (more than CSGO) and can really help you win
üü¢ You can download additional campaigns and even make your own! They even bundled the game with a guide 
üü¢ All the other pros of CS 1.6

Cons
üî¥ Old and outdated (not a fair con but important nonetheless)
üî¥ The game can be repetitive at times
üî¥ Some sounds are quite annoying (especially with the tutor)
üî¥ The UI is not very intuitive. Beginners may need time to get used to it
üî¥ Most servers are empty. Some are still active though
üî¥ All the cons of CS 1.6

üü¢üü¢üü¢ More pros than cons, but I‚Äôm trying to be equal :)

Final rating: 8/10 If you liked 1.6 you‚Äôre gonna love this!

Thanks for reading my review!

PS: I nodded the fuck out of this game. Go to gamebanana.com/games/7. It makes the game even better ;)

Having only ever played Counter-Strike as a child on Xbox, moving onto PC in my later years and revisiting this game is not only an honour and a privilege, but also mind-blowing. The scale and breadth of this instalment to the Counter-Strike series is killer. I hope to one day see a modern take on single player Counter-Strike. Playing Condition Zero and Deleted Scenes puts Call of Duty to shame, it's a very impressive; technically and graphically speaking. There are many missions here to give a try, so what are you waiting for?!"

1875,Best Memories ;)
1876,its nice
1877,"I play all my games in solo, so seeing this game recommendation from a friend, I though I'd go ahead, and give it a try. Before I knew it, I became very fond of it. It had all the ingredients I judge a game by.

It's challenging, story immersive, graphically appealing, and the music score is fitting to the game, and its scenes. The combat is most challenging, and takes a great deal of practice to become a true pro:)"
1878,nostalgic!
1879,(y)
1880,just dont
1881,this game AI is better than CS:GO
1882,the deleted scenes are better
1883,too hard
1884,"[h1] Counter-Strike: Condition Zero [/h1]

[b] A Very Sub-par, Single-player Focused Counter-Strike [/b]

[b] Counter Strike: Condition Zero [/b] sounded somewhat appealing to me on paper - a set of tactical missions with a customizable squad and loadouts filled with CS-style tactics. What I encountered instead was a very lackluster set of squad-based missions with irritating AI and a very pointless customization system.

This game has some nice ideas within it that should be a part of any modern day CS-style game. A squad-style mode with cooperative missions would be awesome to see in any title, especially one with the Counter-Strike gameplay loop. In this title, it is squandered on insanely irritable squadmates and very basic tutorial-esque mission setups. While there is some customization in terms of loadouts and squadmates to choose from, the standout guns remain obvious and overpowered while the AI proves itself redundant, serving little more as a meat-shield for the player to hide behind.

The map design is essentially just playing on every map from the base game. There aren't really any major changes as far as I could care to look for, and it felt lazy. Sure, they played alright, but why would I want to play on these maps with AI when i could play with real people? (Note: there were no multiplayer servers available to me that had less than 200 ping, and I live in NA region)

The audio is at least pretty good, and the arsenal is also pretty interesting to play around with. With more polish and work put into this title, it really could have been a stand-out, smash-hit for Ritual, Turtle Rock, and Valve, but alas it was squandered and remains as a very forgettable CS experience. In the end, I would [b] Not Recommend [/b] playing [b] Counter-Strike: Condition Zero [/b] unless you are a very big CS fan and are desperate for some old-school content.

[h2] Final Verdict: 3/10 (Poor) [/h2]

1885,yes
1886,Best counter strike out there
1887,"of course i would recommend, im a huge fan of all counter strikes, if ur collecting this one only to have it like i did, sure go for it, it is only 89 cents when its on sale, so why not, but i wont recommend buying this for actual playing it only if u got friends that also play this but that would be unreal, the community is small and it's becoming smaller every day, it is an old game guys"
1888,"this game is fun 
"
1889,"Fun way to play classic Counter-Strike if you can't find people to play with. Won't have the same feel, but it works. Has some bugs but so did the original..."
1890,"me like spray enemies with my load
"
1891,pew
1892,great
1893,cs 1.6 with a single player mode. pretty good
1894,good
1895,"Best classic fps game 
"
1896,this game made me break a few keyboards back in the glory days.
1897,Decent campaign but no story.
1898,condition isnt zero
1899,"so nice
"
1900,Good game reminds me with my childhood :)
1901,good game
1902,"been playing for years, one of my favs."
1903,Now is possible !!!
1904,"It's alright, if you get in in a CS bundle then worth playing, but if you just want to buy one best CS, then the original one is the most reasonable choice."
1905,good game
1906,best
1907,"The best (and only) single-player Counter-Strike game (I'm speaking for Deleted Scenes here).

A multitude of different missions, stealth, hostage rescue, bomb defusal, mini boss fights, storylines for each missions, the list goes on. Not only does it have a lot of replayability, it's also great for a quick time killer.

If you complete the missions and want more, people have made their own mission packs you can download and play. You can also make your own!

Remaking this in Source would give it more life and probably a larger player-base than ever and give the community better tools to use and create with. Recovered Operations aims to recreate this in Source, although it seems to have gone quiet for a year or two now, so not sure what's up with that.

Anyway, this is a fantastic game and definitely worth buying (worth even more if you get the whole Valve Collection for ¬£7)."
1908,"Nice Game, just couldn't figure out what condition zero stands for here"
1909,"The game crashes sometimes, but it is simply really fun to play, especially with bots. The ""story"" mode is pretty cool as well. Overall, it's a simple yet fun game to play if you feel bored."
1910,The graphics look better i guess
1911,yes is good
1912,I know people say this is shit but i really like the missions
1913,"Best version of the ""Counter-Strike"" series."

1932,Best
1933,its a videogame.
1934,"great
"
1935,"CS:CZ: its alright, cool concept, makes playing cs alone a bit more fun, i like most of the models in this version, besides one or two.
CS:CZ:DS: should've been in the main pack-in for CS:CZ, so much care and work, stories wonderful, was fun to enjoy.

ps: if you dont call it by its full name (half-life: counter-strike: condition zero: deleted scenes) you are doing it wrong."
1936,This game is really nice! The graphics are nice everything is nice and some guys might say its easy to make a headshot but it sure ain't! Because of the recoil and the lack of aim of some players.
1937,its dope
1938,10/10
1939,yes
1940,i really like this becouse it has so much more then 1.6 but 1.6 is good but this is much better but if you dont like cz well its your idea

1960,recently discovered this platform for online gaming...its seamless easy and great fun
1961,"One of the best CS games. I spent most of my childhood on this game, definitely recommended. The missions pack is just perfection I really enjoyed the Tour of Duty and I have completed it many times because it was fun and challenging. Panther is a pain... Maverick is probably the best... damn so many memories with these bots...
[strike] Edited for the badge [/strike]"
1962,"daniel  cool
"
1963,best
1964,NICE GAME FOR TIMEPASS
1965,"This was supposed to be the next Counter-Strike. I can look back and laugh at it now, but it was a disappointment at the time. By the way, this was released just months before Half-Life 2. It's CS and you can play single player... So yeah, let's give it a thumbs up (just barely)."
1966,Nice game
1967,It's good for when you have no internet
1968,Where's the break room in de_nuke?
1969,ok !
1970,Stupid bots only  in my team
1971,COUNTER TERRORISTS WIN!
1972,nice game
1973,"I played CS:CZ after very long time and I didnt regret it :D I heard that people really disliked or even hated this game and I am absolutely not surprised . Counter-Strike: Condition Zero didnt even have to exist . This game is just some kind of a ,,MOD¬¥¬¥ for Counter-Strike 1.6 :D It has maps from 1.6 and also some more maps I guess , but they are just more detailed with better looking textures , a little different movement mechanics and also some completely useless additions to them like ( random crates , boxes etc. ) on many places . I was just shocked that people still play this game , even on STEAM :D As I wrote before , this game didnt even have to exist but ... it does :D  and it will be a part of CS Franchise forever , even when it is completely dumb and weird . If you want to just goof around with your friends even alone , I highly recommend this game to you . Oh , and don¬¥t worry , this game plays good , it is just a Counter-Strike game ;)"
1974,play the deleted scenes there better
1975,"The game is very strong, this game marked my childhood and I will not be able to forget it. It is worth the money, especially for those times."
1976,.
1977,"still great as a singleplayer game
the only ever campaign mode in the counter-strike franchise
many details are enriched as compared to cs1.6"
1978,"Most people don't like Condition Zero, but I didn't think it was that bad.

It's pretty good as a single player Counter-Strike game."
1979,"very funny game
"
1980,for cheap why not
1981,Non Stop Action
1982,I lost my young adulthood to this game :P Great fun
1983,"It's not a bad game at all, I think it's underrated actually. A nice little CS game that can run on potato. Can't say that for CS:S."
1984,"This game is classic, and provided the foundation to many other FPS games today. What still makes it a great game is the fact that it is light, dynamic, and fast. It simply reacts well to user inputs. You don't need cutting edge hardware to play it. You can play on several built in maps, or you can play on custom community maps that are downloaded to your PC automatically once you connect to a server. You can send voice activated messages to your team. The game also allow you to create and publish your own maps, mods and tools. The bad side is that some servers (that are private, not owned by valve or steam), have cheaters and these servers rely on admins being online to ban those cheaters (VAC doesn't do a good job here). I have played it for 15 years, and I still enjoy playing it."
1985,"the BEST Counter-strike game for the series
"
1986,its a fun but its have a texture bugs
1987,cool game
1988,never gets old 16 years in and it still is fun

1997,"best then 1,6   and also best the cs go , ofc cs go  is something else .5 star coz here everyone play steam one and less cheaters  then 1,6"
1998,"it good 10/10
"
1999,"Well these games are legend for me XD. Counter Strike history!!!! Whenever i play this game, i remeber my childhood. Great game would recommend to buy it. Very cheap for the bundle if you buy it during sale. Must have game for cs lover :D. Good game to play even to this date. Just download it and enjoy a lan party. No matter how old it gets will always put a smile on your face whenever you will play it and in the end that all  matters!!"
2000,This game sucks nuts thanks
2001,my childhood game :) such memories
2002,"Classic.
The only bad is the stupid algorithm which controls the bots, sometimes causing them to stuck."
2003,old school Love u should play if u hvnt tried ! its best for fps beginners
2004,"Always come back to this classic, challenge yourself to complete it without the help of bot teammates. Can be fun to play when you don't feel like doing pvp."
2005,"Brings so many childhood memories.
Just bought this game to restore my childhood waking up in the morning going to school and after coming back playing this game for whole day <3 <3 <3."

2018,Very Nice old game
2019,old but gold. ;)
2020,It's fun bot missions for counter strike. Some of the challenges are really tough!
2021,Honestly I'm more used to CS1.3 but this version isn't that bad. I like it better than CS:GO 100% fun to play when the servers in my region has players. AI isn't bad as well. Brings back great memories :)

2034,It's like Global Offensive but better
2035,"Hella fun to play, this was my childhood. I 100% recommend it!"
2036,"Used to play in college days, Joined after 12 Years during COVID lockdown... everything in this game is still the same.. Thanks Steam for giving this platform"

2038,What to say about this one? You all know about this game right? Just buy it for fun and completing your collection.
2039,....
2040,"Like snake and tetris some games lasts forever. CS zero is maybe not an graphical wonder (unlike snake and tetris) but offers great gameplay and hours of great entertainment not only online on the many of the onliner servers with great diversity but also i single player offline mode.
"
2041,"I bought this game, because I saw Pyrocynical play this in one of his vids like 4 years ago"
2042,wow
2043,One of classics... Still good for playing... :)
2044,lov it
2045,CS and cs:condition zero were the experiences that dominated me and many of childhood friends lives. Like we used to steal money from our parents and get together and shady cyber cafes in india to play this! Good times~!

2075,My first FPS game.
2076,"challenging  game , only hate people that cheats"
2077,"I hate to give this game a negative review, but it's got so much bad going for it, I can't give it a thumbs up.

To give an introduction, this game is all about building a team to fight terrorists. The further you get in to the campaign, the better your team gets and the stronger your foes are. It's an interesting twist on Counter-Strike, a gimick worth trying out for sure. On the surface, you've got a solid, casual game, but as you delve into the more dificult settings (which, I mean, if you've ever played Counter-Strike, you will), the problems become hard to ignore.

First of all - the AI is ludicrously stupid. And I mean STUPID. It's the worst feeling knowing that most of the rounds lay on your back, even if your 3-4 teammates are against one guy. I'd give it a pass generally, but this game was released back in March of 2004. Soon after on November of 2004 you had Half-Life 2, a game with remarkable AI. I refuse to believe this game couldn't have solved some of the incredibly broken AI features, such as:
stopping defusal close to completion when you see a small part of an enemy hitbox;
walking backwords into areas and not paying mind to your surroundings;
soon after the bomb is planted, running to an opposite bombsite (like B) after your teammate said the bomb carrier was on another (like A);
throwing nades randomly;
camping the bomb from weird, obscure, far away angles;
not being able to see through transparent, shoot-through railings;
walking around obscure parts of the map, ignore the main goal;
and so on...
This game has got too much going wrong with the AI to give it a pass, especially when it's such an integral part of the game. Anything below expert handles well, the AI doesn't give you an aneurysm, but expert does. Not to mention the challenges, which become luck oriented on later levels. Finish the round in 45 seconds? Sure, just hope all the bots stack up on your location and don't decide to sit around an area. Kill 3 guys with a Scout and don't die? Sure thing, unless you pick off only one and you're left alone against a .1 second reaction team, which knows your position. The bots are dumb, but in the end - they're accurate. Don't think it'll be cakewalk carrying your whole squad against a squad of expert bots.

Calling this bad and telling you to not play it would be wrong from my part, because I still enjoy it. After all, you probably didn't buy it and just have it in your library, so give it a go. A piece of advice would be to try hard dificulty first and then go for expert, just so you get to enjoy it first, then kinda grind it later. Trust me - the worst feeling is watching the bots ruin a round you were sure to win. You've got to play just to experience that.

Also, screw Cutter."
2078,"its fun for me because my computer is kind of crappy, and its fun on multiplayer matches."
2079,"A good old fashioned fps game from the early days. Simple good guy bad guy scenario. No DLCs ,no skins,nothing. Just load your guns and start shooting."

2121,Classic
2122,smooth and ever realistic
2123,okay game but not the best game
2124,"A visual upgrade from 1.6, with some of the official maps remade and also a lot of single player content. If you had trouble installing bots from the internet in 1.6, this one solves it. They also added voices for the bots so it feels like you're actually playing with someone. Skirmish mode is a bit more challenging, you play the official maps but you only win if you beat the challenge that is being asked instead of just killing your enemy. There is also a campaign included."

2144,i dont know what to say just its not better than cs:go1.6 but its amazing too

Condition Zero engrossing single-player campaign takes you around the world, putting you in the shoes of counter-terrorist operatives. Even though any hard core gamer can finish the campaign in two or so sittings, this deserves a play."

Nowadays, this is just an interesting piece of history. There's no reason to buy this unless you're curious. You know if you want to buy this."

2213,its an old game. Probably was good back in the day
2214,dead but fun
2215,"This game is a bit weird. I've never been a fan of Counter Strike, but I do enjoy playing against bots. The progression of objectives with increasingly difficult enemies and smarter team mates is interesting as a game play loop. Perhaps this game is best for those new to Counter Strike as a whole and want to understand the game mechanics more before jumping into 1.6, Source, or Global Offensive."
2216,"It's the second Counter-Strike, it's lost quite a lot of popularity over the years, since now everyone plays CS:GO and forget about the old ones. This one is a little bit different, it's a singleplayer Counter-Strike with the attachment of multiplayer, this is what makes me enjoy the game.

It's got a team selection system as well, you have points, you start with few and work your way up, your team members have different levels of skill. Most of them have different levels of Bravery, Co-op and Skill. Your team members will start with a low level of skill, and as you get further into the game, their skill levels will grow higher.

I'd give the game a 8.14/10, because it's singleplayer, and it's old."
2217,yes
2218,"The case with [i]Counter-Strike: Condition Zero[/i] and the deleted scenes portion of it is that it offers semi-valuable content, but it is baffling as to why [i]Valve[/i] thought it warranted a separate release.

I am very conflicted on this release, as I find value in the single-player missions present in the base game and even some bit of enjoyment in the campaign added in [i]Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes[/i], but as many have complained about during the launch of this version of the original, there isn't enough content here to warrant a separate price tag, and arguably a lot of what they added here should have been present in the original [i]Counter-Strike[/i] release, or added as a free update. Instead, [i]Valve[/i] released this three-and-a-half years after the original's debut, and failed to add enough substance to make up for this confusing and seemingly money-grabbing release. There isn't much here the original doesn't have, and what it does have either isn't worth the money or should have been in the previous installment initially. Valve seemingly backed off on this release after they realized the negative feedback and ratings far below their expectation, but in abandoning this project, much of what could have been improved was instead left in mediocrity, and so this game never got the redemption it could of had.

Although it doesn't have a coherent campaign in the base game, the eighteen provided missions separate from one another are actually not too bad of quality, I found myself enjoying them personally, and they also helped me hone my skills initially before going online and facing other players in the other games. This and this alone is a great part of the release here, but again this is really all there is good that [i]Counter-Strike[/i] doesn't have. The campaign in [i]Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes[/i] is not very good, or should I say it lacks a certain quality and motivation to keep the player interested, which makes the value of this drop even further down. This single-player campaign is not what [i]Counter-Strike[/i] is known for, and it shows us just how bad taking the focus away from multiplayer really can be. Since this game often comes bundled with the original, if you do decide to purchase it, you may as well take advantage of practicing on a few single-player missions, but besides that, this release will likely end up useless to most, and therefore is not worth the money.

[i]Counter-Strike: Condition Zero[/i] is a very confusing mess of a release that not only adds little to nothing new to the player, but came out years later and still had almost nothing to show for the time spent in development. Unless you are an avid fan or think you will find some value in playing through this, it would be best to skip out on this installment.

2243,Good gane
2244,"I love the feel when you feel in tune with the game and the skill it takes to shoot the guns along with the movement speed.  Its a little bit of a faster movement than cs go and the community with condition zero has always been more mature.  I could play this game 24/7, and im addicted to getting headshots with the Ak."

2253,"Counter Strike: Condition Zero is the forgotten game in the Counter Strike series. Not many people remember or realise this game existed. Does it deserve to be forgotten? Absolutely not. Condition Zero is different to all the other Counter Strike games because this is actually a single player game. I actually enjoyed the campaign i thought it was pretty fun. 
While it is a good game it does have some issues. I've had countless bugs and glitches along with poor game design. Like in some parts of the missions you are forced to take damage and enemies spawning in front and behind you.

I actually liked this game more than the original Counter Strike. Well that's because I have no friends to play with.......

One of the most successful Online games, all of a sudden, releases the same game but Offline. I liked it regardless and it was honestly a fun time.

Deleted-Scenes is another story. The game is completely different and it's even more interesting than the regular Counter-Strike: Condition Zero. One of the things that has always interested me in Counter-Strike as a whole, are the spaces or the lore behind them and it's amazing to have a game that emphasizes on that."

Thank you minh lee for this epic game"

2338,It's probably one of the best Call of Duty games I've ever played
2339,"This is my third FPS game after IGI and CS 1.6 , that I played when I was 7 or 8 years old.  This game came just after CS 1.6, but still people forget about CS CZ most of the times and say that after CS 1.6 , CS S was the game that came out. 

Actually this game is the modified version of CS 1.6 with improved graphics and weapon models , with newer maps , and a new mode which is campaign missions( a mode where u have to complete certain objectives in a CS CZ map with a team of bots which are to be chosen by the player).

I bought this game in 2019 to refresh my memories, and yes this game is worth the purchase, the original AWP sound, the MP5 unsilenced, M4a1s with 667 ROF everything is here. When I get bored with CS GO , I play this game with bots and enjoy my life, rarely I play in community servers because there are very few servers near India so I cant get a decent ping for playing on those servers, and some servers dont allow players with high ping to join, so they kick me . Although I played very little on community servers, I can give a 100% guarantee that this game community is non toxic, and there are no scene of hackers, and people in the servers enjoy the game and have fun.

Although I am no longer a pro CS 1.6 and CS CZ, player I would definitely say to the CS fans and to those who are hesitating to buy this game, just buy this game during any of the steam sales, this game is worth the purchase."

2351,"Despite all the delays, Condition Zero didn't really disappointed as it's the 1st CS to include official BOTs and map call-outs. It could've been better, just like how Gearbox wanted it to be. But maybe it's for the best, otherwise CSGO would've been a game where you can wear suicide belts and use RPGs & gas grenades or maybe not, who knows. Still, a good game."

2372,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a reskin of Counter-Strike. The only new thing added being the missions, which quickly get very repetitive (especially if you try to 100% complete them, it's mental torture)."
2373,"The forgotten middle child of CS. (And Source was the druggie that eventually got kicked out)
Got some okay matches out of this when it still kinda had a community years ago."
2374,"you dont need a good internet connection,so yeah buy this game"
2375,awesome game huge variety of maps and features always players online and almost no hackers ever. its an older game but its also faster and more reliable than any current fps also you can have !free! custom skins.
2376,"very nice, dont know why ppl hate on it
"
2377,it's basically cs 1.6 but with shit futures. Don't buy it
2378,Actually pretty fun to play!
2379,a
2380,A very enjoyable game if you have no internet
2381,nice game
2382,"This is the next version after Counter-Strike 1.6. The gameplay part is completely same. We have addition of bots, single player mode, some new/revamped maps, and better player model."
2383,.
2384,"The single player campaign (Condition Zero Deleted Scenes) gets bad rap and I can't wrap my head around why - you get a world tour of counter-terrorist missions, played in anthology fashion with each level having a self-contained little story and premise (as a bonus, you get to see all your favourite B-action movie cliches of previous century)

It also has classic level design behind it by legends who've worked on stuff like Duke Nukem, and each level is having its own unique and strong thematic feel (albeit very stereotypical, when it comes to characters' regional accents and tongue in cheek writing). Good sound design and texture work that holds up surprisingly well - just make sure to type ""gl_round_down 0"" console command in-game or add it to autoexec.cfg file.

You get to snipe a stealth bomber with AWP rifle - what else do you want out of life?"

2387,"The classic we all loved and played I have over,a 1000 hours on this offline."

2390,One of the best games for low spec gamers try using multimod Sv too
2391,just buy it
2392,This game is a great example of simple is better.  Sounds are a bit out of date but your able to zone in and walk for example and to have an edge on a player alot of fun.
2393,"COOL OLD STYLE GAME WOULD RECOMEND  TO OTHER PLAYERS.

2395,Oldschool nostalgia masterpiece LAN Party 2005
2396,"Helps we unwind and after many hours, knowing where best to snipe from or when to use grenades really helps.  Even though I don't always survive every round, I would hate a game where you never lose."

2405,"An good game with a very troubled development, it has on ok single player mode called ""tour of duty"" its not great but not terrible

The best thing in this game are the multi-player bots, because now you can play offline/have no friends"
2406,nice game
2407,"classic.
has bots too, +"
2408,"For a game this old, its better than Fortnite and PUBG. A game that people can actually play on a cheap office PC at good FPS and Graphics. Pretty good. Better than Fortnite, that's for sure."
2409,its great game
2410,ok
2411,old but gold
2412,"better than CS:GO *Shots fired*

If you like old style CS this is the way to go. if you like whatever the new crap is... well then don't."
2413,"The single player campaign that Counter Strike needs in CS:GO. This was really fun, not really story oriented but each level had a certain challenge you had to complete in order to advance to the next country. All in all it was a short campaign but it was a welcomed one."
2414,good
2415,looks like a good game i guess
2416,You shoot stuff
2417,"The bots are a bit 'funny' but they do get the job done some of the rounds. Bigger downside is that the multiplayer is dead. But overall, its a better version of Counter Strike 1.16. Enjoy because it is worth it (When on special ;) )"
2418,"Underrated Gem. 
This game was quickly forgotten due to the release of Counter-Strike: Source half a year later. It has been seen by many as a ripoff, due to the lack of brand new content. I will contend this by saying this is the best way to play Counter-Strike on the Goldsrc engine. It features everything that made 1.6 great, with more content. First, you can get the single player, which while not very long or in-depth, might be fun to go through. You also get bots included with the game, no mods needed. This is nice, because both this and 1.6 are lacking in players, and most of the servers have undesirable addons and plugins.

Maps are all intact from 1.6, and they also include versions of some of the classic maps that have updated graphics and art,  taken from the XBox version of Counter-Strike. New models are also included. Old custom maps designed for CS 1-1.6 will work great in CZero. Bot support can even be added in. Overall it's got enough new stuff that I would recommend it to anybody looking to experience classic Counter-Strike, because it has some advantages over 1.6 while still having everything from it available."
2419,"good game .OLD IS GOLD
"
2420,OLD BUT GOLD
2421,What a chore.
2422,good
2423,"This game will take you back to your childhood (if your childhood consisted of playing cs 1.6 against bots that is...). If you never cared much about competitive gaming and if playing with bots never bothered you, than this is the game for you.
The bot AI is very competent (unlike CS GO's) and will behave like normal players in a lot of the classic maps featured. you really can't go wrong with this game, plus it will run on basically anything with a CPU in it.

Didn't care much about the ""campaign"" aspect of the game though, but from what little I've played, I can say that it's pretty fun."
2424,Great game.
2425,Tough challenges btw.
2426,Nearly the same as 1.6. One of the only differences is that you can play offline.
2427,Yes as this game has great functions and controls for a game that is older than myself.
2428,Good game.
2429,"I had so much fun in this game back in the days, and its nice too see it still alive with people playing.
Would say i grew up in the HL universe..so this is a must have! :D"
2430,Good

>Easy win"
2433,WOw
2434,"I doubt this will be too much of a
generalization if I say that almost every gamer in the world has played or seen
Counter-Strike. You take on the role of 1 of 4 characters from either the
counterterrorist or terrorist team. In each round, you and your team members
must seek and take out your enemies with the use of gun power and tactical
maneuvering. The first team that is totally wiped out loses, and the round
starts over. Your performance in the prior round, such as number of kills, will
determine how much cash you have to spend on new guns and equipment. Besides
eliminating the other team, terrorists can plant bombs in key locations for
detonation and counter terrorists can defuse the bombs or rescue hostages."

2454,"The CS:CZ is not bad but isn't more significantly improved to the original. The new bumpmap textures, training camp, new models and maps are fine, though.

As for the Deleted Scene part, I would consider it as a bonus DLC for CS:CZ. The Deleted Scene is generally a Single Player game based on CS but it contains a cool Fibre Optic Camera attached PDA and a blow torch to sneak and peak inside enemy lines.

If you are a huge CS fan, buy it and I find this game OK but maybe a waste as CS 1.6 and CS:CZ are almost identical."
2455,"Remember the time when the internet was in it's infancy, and you had to have all  your friends meet in one place and have a LAN party? This game will bring back those memories! Heck, just go ahead and have an old fashion LAN party! I have been playing this game off and on for nearly 20 years, its still just as entertaining!"

2468,"This game is more valuable for playing single player with bots than other Counter-Strike games. Not as popular as the other CS but it is worth to play if you are creative enough to make enjoyable Tour of Duty. The Delete Scenes is not great because it has mediocore gameplay with frustating checkpoints (sometimes, you died 1 second after respawn from last checkpoint due to attacked by chopper), but the features for the latter are decently interactive."

2473,"Good Game. I like the single player Campaign.  CS.CZ does present a unique challenge that's different than most FPS's. Specifically, The opposition is a little more challenging than most & keeps you on your toes.  (They don't just stand still and wait for you to shoot them).
That said it's nice to be able to learn the rudimentary skills of the game around Bots and develop offensive plans.
  I figure once I can consistently top frag the Bots...I might look into joining a team.

2477,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is quite hated by the Counter Strike community, and I can understand why. The game was released just a small time before Half Life 2 and proved to be way behind its time. However, comparing it to the original 1.6 one, this game is a nice improvement. Much better graphics and sounds, bugs fixed, better maps and a decent buy menu, I would definetly play this over 1.6. However, even if you have no internet, you can always play the campaign, which has challenging and fun missions, with interesting bots AI and a lot of different great maps, competitive-quality. Even though the game is pratically dead, there are still some nice servers running on it, so you should definetly check it out.
Rate: 17/20"

2502,"Deleted Scenes was a great SP campaign. It was an actual challenge at times on Medium with the bots having very sharp reaction times quite often.

One very annoying fact is the balancing of health and ammo. Some games I have more ammo than I could ever dream of, other times I'm scrounging for every last bullet. Same with health."

the mechanics are nice and robust with the only difficulty being my own skill (which is awful btw)
and the bots are nice and responsive for that single player action

although it has became obsolete by CS:GO because CS:GO is free to play and has substantially better mechanics, CS:GO on the other hand has worse single player content while the multiplayer mode is better supported.

If you're looking for a single player CS experience, buy this game or CounterStrike Source"

2527,"Condition Zero marked part of my childhood and even now I have lots of fun re-playing the history mode, the rebuild of the maps (compared to 1.5 - 1.6). 

I would say this is a perfect evolution and antecesor of CS:GO. If I have to rate it from 1 to 5 stars or from 1 to 10, I will always give the max score.

Btw, as today, november 15, Im reinstalling it again."

yea but still g-old"
2587,"Good old days man, love this game...<3"
2588,"The campaign mode for Counter-Strike. Not much more to say really.  The ""Deleted Scenes"" are just a story mode, and Tour of Duty is a good way to get to know the maps. Multiplayer is surprisingly active, if that's your thing.  Overall, pretty fun little game that's a bit off the beaten path."
2589,"its just counter strike.

theres no reason to even buy it. you should already have the other ones by now. 

THAT BEING SAID, the delete scenes are baller ass"
2590,Games outdated wont play it anymore but it was fun about 20 years ago.
2591,I actually do like the campaign aspect of this game.
2592,Good!
2593,The game before CSGO...that bring my friends to gather.
2594,Ehh
2595,"Counter-Strike:Condition Zero is an interesting one. At a glance, Condition Zero (CZ) looks similar to CS 1.6 but with better looking weapon and player models. However, the game actually has a few differences in terms of content.

There's the classic multiplayer mode that has official bot support for the maps that come with the game. This part of the game should be familiar to those who play CS 1.6. You can install new maps and the game will attempt to generate the navigation mesh for the bots. If the bots aren't playing well on custom maps, you can finetune it manually too.

There's also a Tour of Duty campaign mode where you are given ""scenarios"" that are using the multiplayer maps with specific victory conditions. Clearing scenarios gives you points, which you can use to recruit teammates who join your team as friendly bots. This mode is actually moddable as well, so you can create your own campaigns.

The bots can differ in their difficulty as well, which is kind of nice. Being older now (Man, has it been that long since CZ came out?), I always appreciate it when games have bot support. Sure, it can't replicate the experience of pitting your skills against real players but bots are great for warming up or for days where you just want to chill or mess around to relax.

Outside of multiplayer, there is a decent singleplayer campaign, called Deleted Scenes, that revolves around individual counter-terrorist scenarios, allowing you to play as the different CT units that are portrayed in multiplayer such as the SEALs, GSG9 and SAS. It's actually pretty fun, all things considered and it answers the question: ""What if Counter-Strike had a singleplayer campaign?"".

Despite being on the GoldSrc engine, there's just something about the pre-Source Counter-Strikes that I really like. Maybe its the nostalgia glasses here but I prefer the responsiveness of the GoldSrc engine to the floatiness that Source seems to have at times. And maybe its because I grew up during the GoldSrc era and I've gotten so used to the look of the game and the other GoldSrc games.

If there's another reason why I've stuck with CZ and CS 1.6, it might be because that unlike Global Offensive, one does not need to pay money for skins just to customise their game. One can go to dedicated modding sites to find weapon skins, player models and maps to enhance their Counter-Strike experience. However, do take note that because CS 1.6 is its predecessor, CZ has lesser mods available for it.

Overall, if you already have CS 1.6, CZ's multiplayer mode doesn't really add much but if you are interested in the singleplayer campaign, you could get CZ just for that."
2596,oldy but a goldy
2597,"To be honest, I didn't really like this game and I wouldn't recommend you to buy it, but it comes with the CS:CZ Deleted Scenes which is more fun to play and enjoyable. 

Rating:
Counter-Strike: Condition Zero: 5.5/10
Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes: 8/10"
2598,I recommend this game.

2604,better to crack the game tbh.
2605,"This is the one! The one I couldn't stop playing until I finished it up back in early 2000s when it was released. Epic CS only finally with a solid, intriguing, bare-metal Counter-Strike on story-based single player with missions that take you around the globe featuring special forces like GSG-9, Specnaz, SEAL Team 6, etc.!"
2606,Storyline of the deleted scenes are really realistic compared to other Counter-Strike series & the release of Condition Zero without the deleted scene has no story modes & its no where to be found at all.
2607,I Enjoy this game always as the first time that I play it a few years ago. Even more thant the last versionthat I like it too. Good people around the network to learns and enjoy
2608,Yes

2612,A really interesting premise and I only wish it was developed further.
2613,"I've never been a major fan of CS, but I really do like single player games, this is probably my favorite CS game because I simply don't have any experience with the others.
It's very difficult, but it's the kind of difficult that makes you feel so good."
2614,A fun singleplayer addition to the Counter-Strike franchise that may help you get better at the goldsource games without having to embarrass yourself on multiplayer servers. The team picking mechanic is also very engaging. I saw no reason why this was the black sheep of the CS franchise. I'm having plenty of fun!
2615,have fun playing with BOTS
2616,"I loved this game, but the story mode can be boring sometimes. I'm glad I got it.
"
2617,its cool !
2618,Better than CS:GO
2619,Awesome game
2620,Very underrated game. I recommend it highly for the Singleplayer campaign.
2621,"It's fine if you enjoy a really repetitive single-player, and the usual repetitive multi-player, but I wouldn't outright recommend it, when there's updated versions of the game available, with more to offer."
2622,the only counter strike game that has a story lore.
2623,"love the bot 
love the story mode
hope csgo can bring something like that in the future"
2624,bruh !
2625,basically a Counter Strike with Single Player
2626,"Playing this just reminds you of how bad single-player shooters could get back in the day. What may have been ambitious at one point is now dated, old, and what was dated at it's release is now completely archaic. Some things are obviously bad because it's an old game, like the enemy AI, but there are also avoidable annoyances like the spawns of most enemies and the ammo given in levels. Not to mention level layouts which are kind of a mess. As it is, it's an FPS time capsule that I don't think most people would want to open up."
2627,Boring

2629,"With its extensive Tour of Duty campaign, a near-limitless number of skirmish modes, updates and new content for Counter-Strike's award-winning multiplayer game play, plus over 12 bonus single player missions, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a tremendous offering of single and multiplayer content."
2630,one of my fav games i play this all the time
2631,Old school
2632,amzing i love it
2633,"This game scratches the itch for old school counter strike. By no means is this 1.6 in it's heyday, but it satisfies the nostalgia of a long dead game. If you're a loser like me with no friends to play with or skills to speak of, pining for a bygone era, then this might be for you. Cheap, easy, nostalgic."
2634,good game
2635,This game is and never will be as legendary as 1.6 but the singleplayer campaign is a fun time at least.
2636,it gud
2637,pew
2638,Classic CS Baby!!!! Really love this game!!!
2639,A little bit new But still Oldschool <3
2640,updates just for the steam awards thing.

2642,also a classic
2643,"No problem, we could always throw icicles at an intruder. HOAHOAHOAHOHO!"
2644,"It's a good game, but it's kinda cringe. But, at least it looks pretty good on PC."
2645,Great Game
2646,"CS maps in singleplayer with bots as enemies and bots as teammates (which you can choose).

You get a good sense of how to use the various weapons and get a sense of the maps if you never played them.

You have to achieve certain tasks with each map.


Even on normal you have some challenge. Bots sometimes are clever - sometimes outright stupid.


Worth trying it...when it is on sale"
2647,"I've never been a fan of CS, I've never understood all the mass that are able to move (and it's admirable), moreover, as a gameplay point of view doesn't add anything new. 

In my opinion, the only positive thing that this game brings, is the ability to allow the community to let the imagination flow, allowing the users to play football, golf or any sport in certain servers, which is nice."

2658,CSCZ is counter strike with a story mode. Highly recommend if you don't mind early 2000's graphics.

2661,counter-strike: story mode
2662,Old but gold
2663,condition zero friends
2664,Good old CS.
2665,"[h1]This game is just Counter-Strike 1.7[/h1]

All these people saying Condition Zero is bad or worthless are being a bit dramatic.
Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is practically Just Counter-Strike 1.7, if you know what I mean. There's literally no reason to say this is the worst Counter-Strike game in existence because it's just the original retail 1.6 but with some improvements. Also keep in mind that Counter-Strike for the XBox existed and it was a nightmare to play.

Condition Zero added HD reskins for all models, detailed textures, new high quality maps including original maps from 1.6, a bunch of little bug fixes and most importantly, improved bots that come with the game so that means you don't need third-party mods to install for bots. Would I say the bots are amazing? It's better than most bots I've seen on multiplayer games and it's pretty competent when properly noded and programmed for a map. It's fair enough but could be better especially when the game has a campaign based around fighting with offline bots.

This tour of duty campaign is boring, to say the least. It's a chore and there are loads of to-do-lists to complete. Some of the objectives you have to do are really specific and hard to encounter, making the rounds go over and over and over. Play it if you're so lame and have no life, but I'd rather do something more useful with my time. Let's be real, it's not like you were going to write the album of the generation by the time you could finish the tour-of-duty campaign. However there is one thing I did notice with the campaign that caught my attention. It seems to be that all the bots have different personalities and behaviors in game but it isn't explicitly described in the menu for some reason. Some bots choose to flank, some bots choose to run head first at the enemy after seeing a fallen comrade and some just camp and run away when seeing too many enemies. That was a really cool feature but it ultimately just gets obscured by the fact the the campaign is a load of baloney.

As for the multiplayer... it's just Counter-Strike. They literally did not alter the game mechanics in any way like they promised to do in the early previews for Condition Zero. No Molotov Cocktail, no CS Grenade, no Gas Mask and no LAW Rocket Launcher and so on. A lot of exclusive maps were cut from Condition Zero for no good reason but managed to leak into the internet and they're posted on Gamebanana and other mod sharing websites. Some of these things sound familiar to some and that is because they were reused in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Deleted Scenes.

As for Deleted Scenes, that game is a colossal failure. No wonder why it's called 'Deleted Scenes'. Valve didn't properly give the developers enough time to create what was going to be something new and interesting for Counter-Strike multiplayer but all of it just got thrown away. There was a campaign to go along with the fresh new Counter-Strike game which is now called 'Deleted Scenes'. It's really boring. It's bad because of so many reasons. The weapons don't feel satisfying or good to shoot anymore and the combat is extremely boring and whenever you're doing anything that isn't combat, it's worse. The story for all the missions are bland and boring, the voice acting and presentation is dull, playtime is short and the graphics considering it's release time is really outdated and unacceptable considering it came out the same year Counter-Strike: Source did. So yeah, Deleted Scenes kinda' blows. The only thing I found to be kind of great about Deleted Scenes is that it has a variety of locations unlike a lot of other shooters at the time.

I feel like if Valve and their developers got their sh*t together they could have made a good game. I believe based on what leaked materials came from the development of Condition Zero we could have had something like Global Offensive back then but Valve had failed to promise."
2666,WORST. SEIRES. OF. FPS. GAMES. ON. STEAM. EVER!!!! ITS THE SAME AS CS 1.6 BU WORSE!!!!

2670,"My name is odinN, and I recommend this game that must play everyone!"
2671,C + 2 =ENEMY SPOTTED ! thank me later
2672,"No, just no.

I played this game for 3 minutes, then waited 2 minutes in the main menu so i can $hit on this game in my review.

I would rather be playing CS 1.6 with bots all day then this game. It is very bad, probably the worse game in my library.
Everything that exists in this game is bad. Worse 3 minutes of my life, i enjoyed staring at the main menu for 2 minutes though.

"
2673,Its really good
2674,"Well, it might was a good game back then. Single-player campaigns are just really bad. Terrible voice acting, non-sense mission objectives, very bad AI etc. 

No wonder why Valve ""deleted"" these ""scenes""."
2675,One of the best games ever. Played for 1800+ hours and counting. U can understand why its awesome. Give it a try and u shall never leave it.
2676,"Single Mission>

I'm playing level of expert, and remain only 3 maps.
It's just refusing to yield, not a fun. very boring...(why am I doing this....)

Basically, bot(computers) has aim hack and wall. Or auto respond to your movement. Even if you are careful on your foot sound, bot always know your approaching. So, just play again and again, and memorize enemy's appearance. It's the only way to win. But.... If you rush with your teammates(bot), the enemy would always fire on your head first haha. It's not your head size!! Don't blame on your head. The enemy is just hack.

Furthermore, the true enemy is your team, not the terrorist. They'd buy a flash bang and grenade in CT's home after buying a main weapon(rifle), and start to run just holding a FB, HE grenade though. Unfortunately, They have so so bad skill as compared with your enemy. Ten to one, terrorist could wipe your mate out easilly, and fool guys miss a grenade on his hand. If you running behind them, boooom!! (it's not a joke) Don't stand in front of team, They could kill you, not your enemy... (saddly, it's not a joke either.)

Terrorist force can make 'stick together' and our team mate couln't. Maverick guy is the worst above all. Maverick is the best shooter, but he is childish teenager... When the C4 ticking on A site, our team rush to the B Despite guarding B shortly before... OMG. And yet If you earn the point hardly and can employ level 5 guys, don't be upset on their terrible telant. Situationally, level 4 guys more useful than 5. Of course, The 5 point guys could cooperates more than 4 guys, but sometimes they interrupt your view and block the way. (Bull Sh** the ""Lead the way, sir"" get away from me plz!!!!) So, If you confident to your shooting, just let them go in the start point.

And... In the hostage resque mission, the command ""hold posion"" could help at the beginning because TR force is so strong and CT's not.

Wish your luck guys....... Delete the game is the only way to survive...

I've had so many unforgettable memories with the game although I don't play them any more after CS:GO release :("

2704,Interesting..
2705,"I like the game overall! It is nice because it has both multiplayer servers, and local server content. You get more of you money with this one than Counter Strike and Team Fortress Classic, which are just multiplayer games with servers and no other content!  Overall, I recommend getting the game on sale like I did, it is not worth paying $9.99 for this old game. I got the Counter Strike Complete Bundle on sale for $1.28, and it was cheaper than all the games combined on sale! So, please just wait and get it on sale! It deserves a 8/10 for the game!"

Pros:
-Easy LAN using mobile hotspot without data
-Somewhat seemed 'realistic' at the time.
-Details such as weapon weight, info etc are real

Cons:
-Weapon Accuracy sometimes are just outrageous
-Bots are either kinda stupid, or Ultimate Pro (1 shot from them kills you)
-Sometimes AI's get stuck and ruins the game
-Multiplayer only (No Campaign)

2847,"CS Condition Zero could be considered the retarded middle child of the Counter-strike series; loved by gearbox and finished by turtle rock studios while they were finishing CSS. Ignored by Valve. In its current (and final) state, the game boils down to CS 1.6 with bots and some might say [i]improved [/i] graphics, but I'd say they're different, even though they might be higher resolution.
The other part, the deleted scenes are an interesting experiment, being a single player campaign for Counter-Strike. They're alright, but not groundbreaking.

This game is only 0.99c on sale, cheap fun.

Comes with missions, modes to test you.
Has an online player base still.
Bots are retarded as hell sometimes but funny.
Has a vast array of maps, unlike CSS, CSGO, or 1.6
hip firing isnt point accurate like in CSS.
Hostages are funny. They can move about on their own.

You recruit your team based on the points you earn and then basically play a Counter Strike bot match with some additional challenges you have to complete. The AI isn't the smartest and your ability to issue commands to your team is fairly limited but overall it's still a enjoyable experience. I have not tried the multiplayer, but it seems to be Counter Strike with some additional weapons and gadgets.



The real ""fun"" however hides itself in the Deleted Scenes. There you get a weird mix of short, kinda over the top story missions played on some of the most confusing maps i have ever seen. It is pretty much a given that you will find a spot per mission where you will just wander around trying to find a way to progress. Some random computer you have to activate to open a door, going along a small path by jumping over a balcony, having to go back to where you came from without a clear indication to do so, jumping on a barrel to get over a fence that doesn't look like your supposed to get over and so on. Your ammo is very limited, resulting in a few situations where your just running at the enemies with a knife in your hand, hoping to survive. The enemy AI is pretty much nonexistent , they either stand around not reacting to gunfire right next to them or just run straight at you. To top all of that off there is also pretty much no delay for them to start firing at you, causing such fun situations where you go around a corner just to be immediately shot by a sniper or rpg. Going through a mission without running low on ammo and health seems almost impossible.

But somehow the absurdity of playing a Valve published Counter Strike single player with such bad game design makes this whole experience kinda enjoyable, at least when you bought that game cheap on sale."

This game is purely just tours of duty throught the cs maps, makeovers and new maps. playing versus diferent variety of bot levels and assembling your own team

CS:Condition Zero Deleted Scenes: 
The real deal, this is the game you see in the pictures of the store page, you get to play counter-terrorist missions all over the earth"

2962,"Let me say, that i never expected to play a single player version of counter strike...no, wait, all my counter strike games are single player since i do not have friends and i play with bots...kek.

Anyway, the game is actually pretty good, minor AI stupidity apart, it is pretty detailed, has entretaining missions, some easter eggs here and there, AND THE NUKE IS ABOUT TO DETONATE, DEFUSE THE BOMB.

2993,Better then hl2
2994,"Back when Counter-Strike tried a campaign mode.

The game is a series of mini-objectives against bots on various maps, while the Deleted Scenes extra is a full blown CS campaign with many elements of the online game being brought in with solo FPS gameplay mechanics (such as equipment) to make a fun and hilarious game (the stereotypical russian accents make me laugh every time).

The multiplayer part is quite similar to the original CS but with slightly better textures.

Overall, this isn't a game for people who like CS:GO, it's more for the fans of old school FPS games and OG Counter-Strikers. I do recommend it nonetheless, but keep in mind that the game is over 10 years old."
2995,Still one of my favorite games. I just love to come back to it just to play the campaign. 6/10 but back in the days it would have gotten a higher score!
2996,"An absolute classic. Sunk many hours of my life into this, be it on LAN with friends, on the missions, or online (still some active servers in 2019, 15 years after launch). I personally find some of the graphically updated maps clearer and overall more beautiful than in the original 1.6.

V E R Y affordable during sales, it's a (by today's standards) simple game that you won't regret buying. As it is older (some may say ancient), it runs even on the worst of OS potatoes, so that may interest some buyers."

3024,"Counter-Strike - originally a mod to Half-Life, created by the well-known Minh Le (then a CompSci student spending more time on the mod than on his own studies) is best 
understood as a formula for a game rather than as a game in itself. It's a formula so ingrained in FPS games for many years afterwards - competitive, repetitive, harsh, unforgiving, simplistic, multiplayer/team-oriented, wrapped in a modern military flavour at that time only prior seen in a few games such as Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (1998) and Le's own ""Navy SEALs"" Quake mod. Later, gamers would see how Counter-Strike's game modes and style would be copied by common games such as Sudden Attack (2005) and CrossFire (2007). In many cases, these games would even copy Counter-Strike's map layout, e.g. Sudden Attack's ""Desert 2"" is clearly a remake of Counter-Strike's de_dust2. Often these games are referred to as ""clones"" or ""ripoffs"" of Counter-Strike, even though they are quite distinct in their own way - especially in being geared towards a ""pay to win"" model, and blurring the lines between in-game currency and real money. Counter-Strike became a Valve product once Le and co-creator Jess Cliffe were hired by Valve, and since then, subsequent titles have been conservative (changing little of the gameplay, with most of the changes being graphical improvements) innovations on their original work, though CS:GO effectively ""monetizes"" the Counter-Strike formula as the various Asian (especially South Korean) ""clones"" and ""ripoffs"" have in the past. 

The premise of these games is rather simple - players are random combatants on a team in a series of brief military engagements (a match) repeating themselves in the same map. Each match is comprised of multiple rounds, and the team winning the majority of these rounds wins the match. After each round the map is effectively reset. In Counter-Strike, each match begins with players joining the T (red/terrorist) or CT (blue/counter-terrorist team). One team has a goal, the other team's goal is to effectively prevent them from achieving that goal. For example, in maps marked ""de"" (Bomb Defusal), such as ""de_dust"" or ""de_dust2"", a random T will spawn with a ""C4"" object which must be planted (by any T) at one of two bombsites. CT's must prevent the bomb from being planted (by killing the carrier before they are able to plant it, or defusing the C4 within 45 seconds of its successful planting). In Counter-Strike, all players start each round from a practically clean slate except money or weapons carried over from a previous round - there is no long-term progression or persistent items. Instead, items are bought with $ accrued from winning/losing rounds, killing enemies and other in-game actions. Some of these items differ by team - e.g. the illustrious AK-47 (weapons are known by different names in-game) - is exclusive to the Terrorists. Generally a unique item on one team will be countered by another on the opposing team, e.g. the M4A1 is exclusive to the CTs. 

Counter-Strike is largely about the speed and precisity of one's aim - weapon accuracy is heavily reduced by movement and automatic fire, and body shots are significantly weaker than headshots. This means that the game boils down to shooting heads as fast as possible. More proficient players will increase the chance of their team winning the round, and they will have higher incomes to attain better weapons and gear. This means that matches are hard to turn around once a team has an upper hand - since a losing team will largely be confined to weapons that are arguably underbalanced, as evidenced by the fact that only a subset of the game's content is frequently used, and players begin quitting due to the notable lack of respawns till a round's end. Most players will stick to a handful of weapons and new players will find themselves encountering players who use part of this subset almost all the time - the AK-47, M4A1, P90, AWP and Deagle in particular. Some weapons like the Grenade and MAC-10 are so useless that sticking with default pistols likely gives players are a better chance, especially as refraining from buying weapons whilst being on the winning team is likely the fastest way to accrue $. 

As the second iteration of Counter-Strike, CS:CZ uses the same, aged GoldSrc engine. There are minor map changes unique to CZ, but the game otherwise retains the same graphical ugliness largely missing from its sequels. CS:CZ includes the little known ""Deleted Scenes"", several single-player missions with no connection to eachother. The game can't run higher than 100FPS without issues. Sounds are largely Jess Cliffe's intentionally muffled voice along with low-quality gun sound recordings. UI is minimalistic and utilitarian. I have found no obvious stability issues. There are no ""safe spaces"" to allow new or deficient players to self-segregate, no tutorials. However, CS:CZ (unlike CS, but like CS:S and CS:GO) include AI opponents (""bots"") which allow players to simulate most of the aspects of online-gameplay without the hassles of embarrassment, lag, long waiting times upon death (use bot_kill once you are dead), etc. Bot matches allow players to gain familiarity with the weapons, game modes and maps. Game content is all upfront - no DLCs, nothing locked by paywalls or time. I have not played enough in recent times to comment on the level of hacking/glitching or whether CS:CZ has an active player base. 

In general, CS games are likely best enjoyed with friends playing cooperatively. There are reasons that I might recommend CS:CZ when it's highly discounted - if you're a fan of the CS formula and curious about the series' origin, you don't mind underwhelming single-player content and ""Deleted Scenes"" appeals to you, or if your hardware is too deficient to play modern games properly. CS 1.6 was after all very popular in countries with low rates of computer ownership, where ""net cafes"" tend to be bustling. However, most players will be much happier with the better-looking, more refined Source Engine found in CS:S, or if a large player base and an in-game market are more appealing, then you should simply go to, or stick with, CS:GO. In the vast majority of cases, I recommend any curious reader of this review familiar with the later CS iterations to remain with them, and to instead sate their own curiosity with a YouTube video rather than a purchase they will likely regret. Here are a few of my own (note that the Elite bot difficulty is very punishing in CS:CZ), though there are plenty of gameplay videos that will suffice:

3061,"What Is Counter Strike: Condition Zero ?

Useless, an utterly useless game, people who want the classic CS experience will go to the original 1.6 version, the ones who want a more modern and polished version will go either to Source or Global Offensive, this game, Condition Zero, is the ""middle ground"" that had no reason to exist, its primary idea was to be an improvement over 1.6 and look where it all went to, Source back then took its place just a few months after its release and left it with nothing, because CZ is what it is, a lazy game, the whole multiplayer experience is the same with slightly improved graphics, other than that the game gives you something new: singleplayer content, one is a series of matches with bots with objectives to complete which just sucks and the other is a campaign which probably inspired CoD and other games we have today in terms of campaign, you do a bunch of missions on different places around the world, playing a different nameless character, with something set up in the background like why the mission is happening, each mission goes into completely different concepts, some are stealth influenced, other are full assault, the thing is while some set pieces are good looking for the game, it just feels rushed and broken, there are so many bugs, AI pathfinding issues, the handling of the weapons here are horrid, the enemies you fight are horribly designed, there are issues with a mission fully glitching itself making you unable to proceed and start all over again, it just feels like a rushed experiment that failed at every possible level, a really bad thing, thing is, Source, came just a while after CZ and people play CS for the competitive experience, so all this singleplayer stuff is low-quality waste of time, Source did the competitive better, it picked the foundation of 1.6 and built a more modern and new take on it, CZ just copy paste it and did some minor improvements, today, it has the lowest playerbase of the 4 games and to be sure, theres no reason to waste your time with it, just skip this one its pretty crappy."

3073,"This part mainly is for the Deleted Scenes. The first game isn't really special, the maps were pretty cool though.

This game is one of the biggest suprises of my Life.

I owned this game for years and I'm sure thousands of people just ignored it like I did.
I completely played through the original yesterday, so I was still in the mood for some new maps, so I decided to play this game expecting the same simple Gameplay of the first one.

But this game blew everything out of the Water.

The Maps were really interesting and it looked really good in 4K 120 FPS. (On a 1080p monitor).

The Game has a lot of charm, especially the Voice Acting. So many different accents, from German to Japanese, I love this stuff. If you know some of these other languages, you'll have a fantastic time.

If you're looking for a challenging game with a variety of map locartions, this is for you.

Graphics: 7/10 For it's age it looked really good. It was fun to explore every nook and cranny.
Gameplay: 9/10  I always wanted a campaign of CS, and I never thought of this game.
Story: 4/10 Every Mission has it's own story, there really isn't much to say
Music: 7/10 It definetely fits the game. Was nice to listen to and never distracted."

3122,"(THIS REVIEW COVERS MY THOUGHTS ON DELETED SCENES ONLY)

Fun game in general. Should be treated as a basic tutorial for 1.6, but it's got some issues

>Some levels require you to use specific grenades and specific spots. Since the game refuses to give you any more than what you spawn with on Difficult (This is the only difficulty I've played on), and since some missions such as 5 have the player placed in a position where you feel inclined to use them, if you do, you gotta start the entire mission all over again.

If you have shitty aim, the mandatory SSG08 sections will absolutely get you to hate this game. Since I have decent aim these aren't a problem for me, but I can see how these will make some people angry.


There are occasional spots where you can get killed because you got stuck in the map.

The Arctic Avengers had a lot of missed potential to develop a story to this game. I think the reason why this game wasn't successful was because it had no story. The first opening missions could have been an introduction, and then the Arctic Avengers stronghold and more missions themed around their plot could have served very well.

Other than these, the game feels and works pretty solidly. Its just playing with bots on Half Life maps. I wouldn't recommend it though, just buy Source, GO, or 1.6. and have fun on those. All have great communities and workshop community gamemode support (except 1.6, maps and stuff for that game are a little less straight forward due to the age of 1.6)"
3123,Back to childhood
3124,"Good game.
Would recommend."
3125,"The game is old yes, but it's still good to play. Strongly recommended such a good game to go back once in a while to play. <3"
3126,"CS 1.6 but with bots.
Counter Strike Condition Zero Deleted Scenes is way better"
3127,Nice Game
3128,When did I get this game again?
3129,I recieved this as a gift. Thank god! This pushed my pro career.
3130,condition yes.
3131,shit was lit back in the days. 10/10
3132,"pretty fun, but is laughable in a bad way. It looked like Valve tried to go ModernMilitaryShooter-ish on this one"
3133,Come On what do I say different about this one except it has a cool Idea
3134,das ist eine watermelon
3135,I cannot recommend this game enough.
3136,Campaing for original Counter-Strike
3137,the only counter strike game with a campain.
3138,"This is an Amazing Game, love it best ever, graphics sounds, 100 times better than starting 1.6"
3139,Single player CS with bots a little strategy involved. 8/10
3140,Found this one from an offer and I was actually pretty impressed. It has taught me a little about the whole counter strike offline thingy which is why I think the game is good in it's own regards.
3141,"After playing this game for a few hours there is two different components to this game. Tour of Duty (TOD) and Deleted Scenes (DS). I got this game in the Valve bundle pack and decided to give them a shot because they were just sitting in my library. 

[b]Tour of Duty:[/b]
This game is absolutely horrible! I'm not a great CS player by any means but I'm no stranger to the FPS genre so I decided to play it on hard. It's rather frustrating from the beginning as you're allotted points to assemble your unit with attributes such as skill, co-op and bravery which rank by a strength ratings bad, low, ok, good and high. As expected playing against bots your team is pretty much garbage while the A.I tracks you and kills you like a rabid dog while going against another A.I it's like watching Stevie Ray and Ray Charles having a gun fight. It seems that if you use commands the A.I responds to them. However, being that most of us use mics online I never bothered to learn CS commands. 

Missions requiring you to save hostages can be frustrating as your team A.I will seem to deliberately get good at finishing the round before you can save them. If you rescue them one or two at a time it appears to go over better than collecting all 4 in one go. On that note, the  requirements to pass a level are rather tedious. kill x amount of enemies, kill x enemies with [weapon] Finish round in x amount of time. I guess for the time this game was released it would have served as training but being that most people probably play GO the TOD didn't hold up to the test of time.

Apparently, there are some fun Zombie mods in this game and might be a selling point to you but that aside this game isn't worth getting.

[b]Deleted Scenes:[/b]

I actually had quite a bit of fun playing the DS. It's a linear CS story game where the story didn't make a any sense really just that you go and do a bunch of salvage, rescue missions. On the highest difficulty it's still pretty easy (funny how I complained about bs aim bots for TOR) The best way to describe it, is that it's a CS half-life game. With Puzzles, linear paths, and stuff you expect from half-life games. Is it worth buying? I wouldn't waste money on it alone but if you're going to buy the valve bundle pack it's a fun linear fps game."
3142,is good
3143,plz make a single player campain in cs:go becouse that would be amazing
3144,"it's a great game but what really annoys me is when i get killed by someone (in singleplayer) then the screen turns black when i'm trying to spectate someone and i will be stuck in firstperson perspective which is worse. i'm not sure if i'm going to have the same problem in multiplayer mode too because i never even tried to play the multiplayer mode for some reason but yea it's a good game though

EDIT: my issue has been solved, if you're having the same issue then please look at the replies!"
3145,"Just like the simulations with no salt and all terror. 
Map making can be better done but cmon, its the early 2000s.

I cannot wait for an updated Source/GO edition of this, that would be cool."
3146,YE-es
3147,"Amazing!
The single player aspect helps improve your skill along with the multiplayer servers with the striving community. I would recommend this toy everyone especially if you like FPS games. 10/10 excellent work again Valve. If you like: FPS games; Valve  games; Or just a great strategic gun game in general this game is for you!"
3148,"The game is old yes, but it's still good to play. Strongly recommended such a good game to go back once in a while to play. <3"
3149,"damn, nostalgia hit me hard"
3150,"better weapons graphic. shortly better graphics. I used to play when I was a kid. i remembered this all good maps, except stadium one is bad. :( 

but challanges is not enough and usually same things.

the bots not balance. sometime you can die directly. sometime wait 5 seconds after shoot doesn't matter. but even so it was good times.

deleted scenes is looks like amazing. i will return after finish.

yeah i was right. it was good but artificial intelligence is not like normal condition zero."
3151,"Not many people know or really play this game. It's extremely similar to cs 1.6, which is obvious, but it's from a time where the game could be loved more if CSS had not came out the same year. Both are great games and I have many memories from both."
3152,Suuuuuuuuuuucks
3153,BEST CHILDHOOD I EVER HAD aside from GTA SA
3154,Ohhh such nostalgia...
3155,this is half life but you cant bhop
3156,good old vintage game
3157,"More-than-satisfying mindless fun. The missions are varied, the action is bloody, and you get to shoot terrorists all over the world.

7/10"
3158,"The campaign was shifted from the main game to Deleted Scenes, just so you know."
3159,I shot the bad guy and he did the die thing
3160,Conditon zero looks like a mix of cs 1.6's game physics and cs go's realistic weapon sounds yet it's still a good counter strike game to play.  :-D
3161,"The forgotten child, the black sheep of the counter strike games. If you think about it, CZ is similar to the original Half Life's  Blue Shift. Also deleted scenes, fine little addition
"
3162,"Counter strike condition zero is a multiplayer optional tatical fps, so everyone knows the first real esport title, at least the first so well know by everyone, I know quake 1 and rts games was also esport games well know, but counter strike did more, moba somehow got some of the mmo fans, but the game still around, and I still like it a lot, most of it because its playable in single player, I hate the multiplayer part of this game entirely, there is a lot of coop gameplay to it, but I'm not talking about the sequel here, ""counter strike go"" have deathmach mode, and its all that matters to me in a mmo fps, this one in other hand only have the ""bomb mode"" where both teams have a goal, mixed with ""last man standing"" mode, I don't like that because you get stuck without gameplay for 10 minutes or more, but since this game have a single player mode, you can restart the match any time without many problems, loading times don't take much long, and in my opinion the graphics still holds up very well, biggest problem with this game is the sniper reloading animation using the quick scope technique, that being manually making the reload pressing twice the ""Q"" button, it doesn't looks good like in ""counter strike go"" it looks much much better in ""counter strike go"", definitively my second favorite counter strike game, and it could be my favorite counter strike if it had ""free for all"" or ""deathmach"" modes in it, but it doesn't, so second favorite counter strike game.

+many weapons to choose
+single player mode included
+cool main menu
+evil and good are the same? what?
-no soundtrack, ok there is one music... one

3163,why am i  buying this game on 2019
3164,fucking terrible
3165,comes with the steam release of the original so its alright
3166,Pretty cool. Feels like you are playing MW3 Single Player on a Nintendo 64.

3172,I have been stuck on the same level on hard mode for 2 years
3173,"i dont play it much,but i think if you can handle old graphics quality then it is a good game"
3174,"A counter strike game with single player missions and some plot.
Got it from the valve complete pack."
3175,"Basically Counter Strike 1.6 but with improved graphics and the addition of bots. The bots are amazing considering when this game was released (they're still inferior to human players). In addition, the bots are a great way for beginners to learn about the game in a more relaxed environment. There is also a singleplayer Tour of Duty, which is basically regular counter strike missions against bots, but with additional challenges (example: kill 3 enemies with a sniper rifle). Sadly, the Tour of Duty missions are Counter-Terrorist only. There are no Terrorist missions."

3179,Counter-Strike: Condition N
3180,Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a fantastic game. It gets rid of all this modern junk and just gives you a gun and grenades. You have to win using purely your skills. The guns in this game feel great. The maps are good and you can get a ton of workshop maps. The game is far from dead with full servers and a decent playerbase. If you are looking for a great classic FPS shooter then Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is for you.
3181,"CS:CZ Deleted Scenes are still pretty fun to play. In '05 I played it first time and I really liked it. After 15yo I still like to play it. It's very easy to play and story is not that gripping but if you like it as do I, You won't mind. I like those short stories."
3182,"Another classic, more singleplayery but still fun"
3183,<3
3184,cool game
3185,yes
3186,"this game is not dead, (yet) '-'"
3187,I tried to update it and my antivirus said that is said that is a virus
3188,"Random head shot simulator, now with a repetitive campaign mode containing a marathon of choke point maps. 

Even though this is the best game for new people who would want to learn the quirks of Dumpster-Strike, I would recommend that you should stick to the Easy or Normal difficulty missions of the campaign mode, if any higher then the game would just cleave your balls off and shoot you twice in the back of the head, the difficulty spike in this game is honestly staggering. 

Can't say anything about the online servers, since I already experienced the horrors of Dumpster-Strike: Source firsthand, so I guess it wouldn't be any different.

If you're still interested in playing Dumpster-Strike, there are honestly way better first person shooters out there. Highly skill-based or not, a game should be fun to learn and yet in the Counter-Strike series, it doesn't let you do that; it's not fun to learn at all. There's a difference between being challengingly fun to being plainly unfair. 4/10"

3192,"This version of counter strike is really the bastard child of the counter strike franchise. it came out at a time when source was out (or around the corner depending on where you were) and while cs 1.6 still had a thriving player base. if you are buying it today and are expecting an active player base i'm sorry to disapoint but you wont really find it if you live in North America. If you want to play an older Counter Strike game with an active player base than try CS 1.6 (known as just ""Counter Strike"" on the steam store) or try Counter Strike Source as both still have a thriving player base and many active servers from the Americas as well as Europe and Asia. In terms of the game on its own it is essentially an updated version of the origional counter strike with some better visuals as well as a single player campaign (something that wasn't seen before or since this game)"
3193,<3
3194,"Nobody plays anymore, but still good to chill on"
3195,"[h1]Singleplayer CS[/h1]
So this is basically the original Counter-Strike but you: 
- Select your team members (bots) of differing skill and cost
- Play through different maps completing challenges during the rounds
- When you complete all the objectives you move onto the next map so they are as short as only a few rounds per map

Interesting twist on the counter-strike formula and not very long, only a couple of hours to complete. 
Nice relaxing break for any counter-strike player who just wants to play the game without having to rely on braindead teammates.

Multiplayer for this is dead so play regular CS if you want a Multiplayer experience.

Also Maverick is GOD."
3201,Counter-Strike Story Mode.
3202,One of the best game to bring back your childhood memories.
3203,"Personally, a great addition to a great game, I would way, way recommend this over CS:GO, only because in this game your not going to find a snotty kid impersonating a russian  then telling you to (insert insulting word here) off, I also like this game because, at times, the AI starting a single player game can be fun, even though they are half the times idiots, it can make you feel like your playing back when it first came out, but many have forgot how this is, saying things like ""oh it was good in my childhood but its dead so yea go play cs:go"" and I really am okay with you disliking the game, but have you ever played CS:S? or another one from the series? (please don't play nexon though) I advise people to give it a try at least even if it is dead. I don't play it all the time, just at least sometimes."
3204,"One of the best games I have ever played, There are no 9 year old russian Igor's in their moms basement screaming ""RASH B CYKA BLYAT"" and the ones who still play are really nice people."
3205,"The single player part of the game is really badly done. I like challanges, but when the AI has aim boot extreme on hardest difficulty it's not so fun. I wished they would have done it in another way. Not only that the AI instantly kills you 95% of the time (in the mission with the heavy machine gun for example), they also tends to turn around instantly and together with the aim boot and they can smell you (they always know where you are) you are completely screwed. It feels your only hope is your luck. It's time to uninstall this crap. There are lots of other games (new ones) which are much more enjoyable like Day of Infamy, PUBG, etc..."
3206,Been playing this game from my childhood. Definitely one of those games that require pure aiming skills.
3207,"No please, if you have money and a brain don't buy this.

you can shoot someone point blank in the neck or even head and nothing happens (and this was in singleplayer) and
it happens so much.


this game is trash and if someone said you should get it they are lying hard to yo ass."

I recommend to everyone !!!"
3213,"Ahh, what a breeze that was.
A lot of people don't know what's different between this game and CS 1.6, the key is that this one is the latter on sterodes, slightly better graphics, definitely better vocals, and more balanced gameplay, plus a shocking but welcoming campaign mode. What is that you say? A bunch of missions that you have to complete alongside checking all of the side tasks required to pass each mission, a fun a and challending process none the less.
This is what CS 1.6 should have been. But still, that one has the nostalgic element to it."

3236,"I love playing single player creations in the goldsource engine, since I grew up on Half-life, but condition zero deleted scenes was pretty awful. I can't believe people actually got paid money to create such a shoddy product. Sure the maps were very well done and the art direction was pretty reasonable considering the tools they had to work with...but the rest was way too cringe-inducing to make up for it. The voice actors, for example, have the most cheesy accents for whatever region of the globe the mission is in. the IRA is my personal worst favorite, followed by the Ruskis in a close second. The training mission was more basic than the one in Half-Life. The gameplay was very predictable, with all the enemies showing up exactly where you expect them to. I'm almost glad Valve put a stop to the project and gave it to another studio, to finish up a proper update to the original CS. If CS:Source hadn't come out shortly after this, Valve would've been a laughing stock.

That said, I very much enjoyed the maps and the art, and the comedy provided by the crap voice acting was enough to make me lol. Would recommend to anyone who likes playing in goldsource."
3237,Thank you for making this shit game free. Matchmaking is filled with illiterate shits and is impossible to play this shit game. Fuck yourself valve. PEACE.
3238,no
3239,another og of a game. great when people play but its sorta dead.
3240,"This game uses GoldSrc and it came out 2004. I won't be talking about Condition Zero Deleted Scenes because I haven't played it too much, but eh. Anyway, Condition Zero is the same thing as the first Counter-Strike, just with missions. I won't talk about the multiplayer mode this time but I will talk about the missions.

The missions are simple, do 2-4 tasks and some of them are actually pretty hard, like, kill 2 enemies with the sniper rifle. I usually always get it but the enemy AI always is hard, no matter what you change it to.

The maps and guns are all the same. So there isn't much to speak about.

Final score: 50% 

I didn't mention multiplayer because it is bad. People cheat, VAC is broken. Also the missions are extremely messed up so this game is pretty much unplayable, it works at some points which is mostly going to happen but it really doesn't do it too much.

Upsides:

- In-game sounds are satisfying
- It can run on a potato
- It is very fun
- A single-player mode (jk lol its garbage dont play it)
- Bots are included with the game, allowing newer players to help familiarize with the game

Downsides:

If you love a stressful single player campaign packed with dumbass AI (my final teammate killed the final terrorist with the bomb ticking down and went across the entire map looking for more terrorists with his knife out) and awkward weapons that somehow ruined shotguns (with my personal experience, the shotguns are more effective when its being use as a sniper rifle because at times, at arms reach, I clearly shoot the terrorist and it did bugger all as he shoots me with one of the shotguns, its a one shot kill. Also head shots are about as broken as TF2 crits). Then this is just perfect for your self loathing ass. Tell me to ""get good"" like a mentally handicapped robot with no free will. But that would never change my opinion. Even though this stuff is pretty objective, to me at least."
3261,still didnt find out the purpose of this game
3262,"It's counter-strike but with single-player missions, fun, challenging, the multiplayer isn't completely dead but it's questionable why is this not a DLC for the original game"
3263,This game its very very old but its good.
3264,B L Y A T  Speaking Course!
3265,good if you have a crappy computer and some time to kill
3266,Better than CS:GO
3267,"reminder this game was made around when the original far cry came out but the graphics look like a solidified piss stain of a mismatch of source and 1.6 graphics, gameplay wise far cry mogs this game to oblivion too 

the new maps are nice though i guess

bad, not far cry"
3268,MY CHILDHOOD :(( <3
3269,"Remember community server (furien, deathrun, base builder, etc)
Godlike game."
3270,"a garbage version of 1.6, dont be tricked by the better texture resolutions and models, there's a riot shield and a dead community anyways"
3271,nc i love this game <3
3272,"I enjoyed this game in all its glory. It's nice to see what Counter Strike had to offer back then. I hope to see more entries in the Counter Strike Series. Thanks for the Linux support, I personally didn't have any issues."
3273,An old nostalgic game! love it!
3274,cs z questami? no tak srednio bym powiedzial
3275,"This is the shit right here,i enjoyed the death animations,well you can find them in funny positions,also i like it because there is still tactical shield here.The weapons,they have cool loading animations especially the M4A1."
3276,CS 1.6 with improved graphics. Underrated game. My first counter strike game I played was condition zero 1 year after it's launch. Sad to see very less players now.
3277,"Works PEREFECT with Intel Pentium Silver, 4gb RAM and integrated graphics!"
3278,"AMAZING!!!!!

3279,Khelna hai khelo merko kya
3280,"It's basically just Counter Strike 1.6 with bots for lonely people like me. It also gets rid of that ugly yellow haze in Dust2, so it's good in my book."
3281,best
3282,I post videos of it
3283,üòç
3284,Nice
3285,"its a good game , but i wonder if weaponary balistics is real , for example the machine gun looks to be weak , america s army game looks to be more realistic and it s totally free !  also team fortrtess game has more beautiful colours  ,,, i hope that my opinion wont offend you , i am not a gypsy pedophile lgbt black magic criminal . eternel yours sincerely !"
3286,"I like missions in this game!
But besides that, It's quite simular to CS 1.6

For Deleted Scenes, the campain is ok, nothing crazy honestly but still nice to try."
3287,I love playing this game !
3288,DO NOT PICK CHARACTERS WITH LOW COOPERATION WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE!
3289,Muito bom esse game.
3290,Gun go bang but :::Condition Zero
3291,It has bazookas and Ventspils. Recommend!
3292,i kinda wish this was in the originall cs but it was still fun but you can kinda complete it in a day its konda short
3293,The second STEAM edition of Counter Strike. I really like the coop tho
3294,A hidden game with lots of replayability potential and fun.
3295,"Great game, I really suggest playing it."
3296,GG
3297,Best
3298,Essentially the same thing as Counter-Strike but now also included a single-player campaign that can be played.
3299,Why not make this game 2/3 eus? Best one without hackers/lamers
3300,Ini juga good gameee
3301,"+More realistic in terms of actual guns
+More options than the rest of the Counter Strike Series (Night Vision, Shield, etc)
+Bots are actually challenging (unlike CSGO where if you want challenging bots you need to go Extreme mode)
+A lot more maps
- AN ACTUAL GOOD FUCKING MINIMAP

Meh, 7/10. Could have been 10/10 and better than CSGO but the Minimap just made it a lot worse.

(for context the Minimap in all Counter Strike Games are supposed to display diffrent Bomb sites, Hostage Release points, etc. But all it shows in CS:CZ is your teammates location. Yeah its supposed to be more realistic but when you make a game too realistic it dosent become fun.)

Just like the old days back in my crappy laptop when i am still a kiddo... just the same as how i remember it...

What a trip of nostalgia it is

Despite the game is definitely outdated, it is still run smooth on new engine, unlike most old game that not compatible with new engine and software. Oh also i love this game despite how bad it is to my eyes.


Definitely GOTY for all people who ever played this game back in the old days! 10/10"
3318,does anyone know how to fix the screen I accidentally zoomed it in does anyone know how to zoom it out again on this game?

3326,"In Condition Zero is like retextured 1.6 but with new features u can buy this game cuz in pack u have singleplayer version and singleplayer version is really good.
I recommend Condition Zero."
3327,Beautifull game even for 2018!
3328,It's a good game if you want to see the development of counter strike. Not really worth buying if it's out of sale.
3329,Go it ____ verry cool : ]
3330,wait this isnt cod?
3331,"Ships with a broken OpenGL renderer that doesn't support detail textures. Valve removed the old D3D renderer a couple of years ago, breaking the game. You're better off torrenting this game (as you're likely to get a fully functional release) rather than buying it, as Valve decided to push a broken update.

As for the game itself, it's pretty much the same as original CS, but with HD models and bots (the reason to get it if you don't like playing on servers with 200 extra sounds and models that change the game completely). There are new versions of some maps with added clutter that makes them worse, but original maps come with the game as well. Deleted scenes are there as well, but it's just a generic single player FPS with horrible AI and weapons and recoil from CS as its only saving grace."
3332,Better bots than CSGO's bots

3349,"Counter-Strike.... No bots.
Condition Zero.... Yes bots.

After my experience with the emptiness of CS (review [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198141201307/recommended/10]here[/url], I tried CS:CZ. The first thing that popped out of the game is the mission. I checked it out, and discovered CS:CZ has bots! At last, I've found company.

Back then, I lack the dexterity required to play this game. Even easy feels so hard to me! But I don't give up. I eventually completed all the missions... on easy.

Thank you, bots. 10/10"

3371,"Counter-Strike -- classic counter strike action and multiplayer

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero -- simple missions (difficulty can be adjusted), play with NPCs or online players.

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes -- Interesting campaign, very hard missions. Some missions have glitches. Graphics are very low-res and hard to distinguish at times. Level design: medium/medium-low quality.
Gameplay feels very rough and unpolished, so play this ONLY IF you are very CURIOUS, or doing a research."

3388,"The missions are really fun, and challenging, you have to balance your team for the map, difficulty and because of the limited points they give you, is even more challenging."
3389,"Close to the first CS experience but with tutorials missions, works great on actual pc but don't play deleted scenes expansion it's a mess."
3390,"I really do not understand the purpose of this game. Yes, the graphics are better, all maps and textures are nicely re-designed but besides of that the game does not bring anything special or inovative compared the previous issue (CS 1.6). My conclusion is that if you are searching for a better looking CS 1.6, this is game for you, but if you already own a copy of the CS 1.6 and wants something more, rather invest into new Source engine based CS¬¥s.

3396,This game has the speed and the feel of an old-school shooter game. The community is still vibrant and therefore I highly recommend it.

Deleted scenes are better than the main condition zero.
Has interesting mechanics.
Fun to comeback and play after some time.
Graphics are great for its time.
Has some issues like ""where the f*ck do I go"" in some missions.
Some times spooky stuff happens like a suicide bomber explodes behind you like a creeper in minecraft.

3463,"Imo CSCZ's idea was amazing. The idea of a CS-style fast shooter with real-life police siege tactics was so good, but CSS overshadowed CSCZ, simply because CSS had a new engine and CSCZ was using the original Half-Life engine. If CSCZ was actually a Source game, it would be so popular, but it isn't. If someone makes a new Tour of Duty CS game, it would certainly become very popular. You have to keep in mind that if we had a CS game with both singleplayer and multiplayer, you didn't have to complain about the gamemodes, you had lots of options. If i wanted to play with bots in CSCZ, i usually made my own server, added bots and simply just made it more fun and i used non-Tour of Duty maps such as 747 or Vostok and it was so much fun. But what was the past is kind of forgotten. I like that people actually are nowadays interested about CSCZ and its deleted scenes, it shows that old forgotten games can be even more fun than the hyped games. 

not to forget that this game had one of the best CS soundtracks/theme, unlike CSS which didnt have absolutely nothing.

3502,"This game is VERY VERY different to the other ones. I feel this one kind of lacks gameplay wise, as (Spoilers) Its just a bunch of minigames each night (Not the shooting ones). valve has clearly put alot more dedication into Story for this one, and while i feel thats a nice turn from the rest of the series, i personally don't like it. 

Overall, really nice effort with the minigames and voice acting, if valve ever made another cs game, however, I think it should go back to the old gameplay style, while keeping similar elements such as voice acting.

Reccomended if you like Deep stories."

3507,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a bare bones, single player focused mod of the famous Counter-Strike mod for Half-Life. There are a total of 18 missions (not including ones made by users) that you can tackle along with 4 difficulty settings. Each mission is set on a different map and the variety of locales is definitely a plus. There are three objectives for each mission and in order to complete the mission you must accomplish the objectives AND beat the Terrorists by at least 2 rounds. However, the AI can be completely wonky at times which is more of a detriment to you than the opponent (especially on the later missions when the teams are unbalanced, e.g. 8 vs. 6). It can be pretty infuriating losing because the AI spent 30 seconds crouched in a corner then walks right by a person from the enemy team without even noticing them. Due to this, trying to complete the later difficulties is an extreme undertaking and requires a great deal of skill to carry your team to victory while still accomplishing all the objectives. Especially since the objectives change with each difficulty setting and some of the later ones are ridiculous (e.g. ""get a kill with a knife and survive the round"", or ""kill an enemy blinded from a flashbang and survive the round""). Overall, it's a fun unique experience for fans of the original Counter-Strike that are looking for a more single player oriented game, but that does not make up for the lack of content and poor AI. 

6.5/10

Now as for the Deleted Scenes portion....that part is fantastic. You play through 12+ missions each with specific objectives and settings that are surprisingly detailed (for the time this game was released). The set-pieces and little reactions some of the enemies have as they die, such as plummeting out of a window to fall on and be impaled by a spire, are really a great touch. This is where the love and care went when this game was made. Fans of Counter Strike should definitely check it out.

When I got this game, I thought it was going to be something like ""Source"" or ""1.6"" but this is totally different, I find this game's singleplayer to be very enjoyable with minor difficulty, picking your own bot team with their personal stats is very cool and I would love to see something like this in ""GO"".

3520,"This is a review for CS:CZ: Deleted Scenes. This game is 14 years old and is better than most modern military shooters, you actually have to give some thought and solve problems to progress in the level sometimes. Steel crates can be moved by holding the E key. I got this with the Valve Complete Pack. Well worth a play."
3521,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a great game, it's a great multiplayer FPS and everyone knows it, so I'll just talk about the 'singleplayer campaign'.

It's just bots, you and bots vs some bots. It's very simple. But, I enjoyed it a lot since building your team up from just you and a few chumps is fun, I like the basic little stats system, and I think it's a shame that the game gives you so much money to play with that you never need to do eco rounds or anything, and it seems that there's no 'campaign' for terrorists, just CTs, but... ultimately, it's fun.

As long as you're interested in just playing some bots for a while, it's fun, maybe a good warmup. Very simple. I beat all of the 'tours of duty' and none of them were very hard, I think the AI tries to make up with its lack of skill with quantity, so you can very easily counter them by picking the highest skill level guys. If you're lucky, they can even solo rounds for you, as long as you do teh challenges.

Below is my review for Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes

Pretty fun singleplayer campaign, but it gets pretty repetitive and it feels like instead of the developer plotting and planning out a long string of missions to put together, everyone in the team just made a bunch of assets and then everyone went off and did their own thing.

There's a few issues.

The difficulty across missions is just all over the place, there's no ramp, some missions are hard, some are super easy. It's rare, but sometimes you'll actually just have to keep reloading saves or even reload a save from earlier in the mission if you have a hard time with something you didn't expect.

One example is the missile launcher guys. One shot from those guys is enough to basically force you to reload your save, either because you just died instantly to them or because your hp and armor are so low you're about to die anyway. The only instance I found this wasn't the case, I think, is the very last mission where there's a few missile launcher guys, but all of them are firing at you generally in locations where they won't hit something behind you. The real problem is the GIGANTIC explosion. It's just a pain since often you'll be reloading more than a handful of times.

The missions are all designed pretty well, I think, but again since it was clearly just a bunch of guys building a random assortment of levels, there's actually a lot of overlap between missions. There's quite a few missions where you have to chase down a target and shoot him until he dies. In one case, you actually have to cheese him by like nudging left and right while in cover so he doesn't fire on you while you just repeatedly headshot him. There's only a couple of stealth missions and they don't even remain stealth for very long.

The tutorial outlines a very large variety of gadgets that they want you to get accustomed to, like things such as remote detonated explosives, the defusal kit, a radio, a fibre optic cable like in SWAT for peeking under doors, and maybe one or two other gadgets I can't remember. Most stuff isn't really used that much, and not super well, the explosives are generally only used to open up a doorway so you can continue progressing, which is a shame since they could have been used for different and more interesting things, perhaps.

The M60 is absolutely busted. It has almost perfect accuracy, way better than any of the regular Counter-Strike weapons, and it recovers fast and does huge damage. As befitting a big LMG, but when in the hands of the AI it's just absolutely ridiculous, if you let them fire on you for more than a few seconds at any range, you're probably dead. While not every mission even has this gun, a few missions have them just all of the place.

A few missions are very railroaded and walking off the beaten track is either punished or impossible, but in more than a few of them you're all but required to do it just to find more stuff to keep on going. Sometimes it's just more ammo, but in some cases it's as much as a weapon drop, and in Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes, each mission only has each weapon ONCE. If you miss a weapon, that's it, you're not going to find it along the way if you didn't manage to find where it was hidden. It's not really a big deal since you can complete every mission without them, but it does make it a bit trickier when you're being given ammo for weapons you don't have.

The way armor/HP work is very punishing. Armor is usually difficult to come by, and with it most enemies will do next to no damage to you, but as it decreases, damage to your HP will rise, until at 0 enemies can kill you from full HP in only a couple of bursts if they're lucky. Headshots on you seem to sway the screen in such a way as to throw your aim off, which is extremely frustrating if you're just trying to shoot a guy and your shots all miss just because he keeps tagging you in the head.

The repetitive nature of some of the missions really kind of makes the game a bit of a struggle, and by the end they REALLY got carried away with the parkour. Having to crouch jump up a whole pile of crates to get to a ledge so you can get to a door so you can continue with the level, that's fine, but it's just weird to me that this kind of thing seems to be in ALL of the missions, numerous times, so often it feels like you're spending most of your time, most of the game in fact just jumping around cramped environments.

I have a lot of complaints, but honestly despite them all it's a great, fun singleplayer campaign, if you ever were thinking 'Counter-Strike would make a great singleplayer game' well, here you go, this is probably the best you'll ever get."
3522,"Honestly, this game is really underrated. It's like a ""Campaign Mode"" for Counter-Strike. There's a lot of effor put into everything here."

3524,i love counter strike and this is very good or the series it should be more well known
3525,"not a Review, just a memorable little story of this game

Since i was in Junior Highschool grade 7th (2010), there was one classmate named Bustomi has an Installation of this Game (CS:CZ), then in Friday we got a Computer Class, so we got around 25 PCs, Tomi already installed CS:CZ half of them, around 12-14 PCs (hope i remember), all my friends (Boys only) are so happy coz the Teacher absent, so our class got a chance to playing a game freely.

the game is begin, everyone ready in main Menu, Fortunately someone told the LAN Cable connected to each other's PC (with Internet connection) so we got to play ""Lobby"" together, then The ""Lobby"" is work! , hahahhaha the map we started was in ""Cs_havana"", i got Terrorist faction, i forgot my teammates, but i remember all my classmates who played that match, no matter what factions they got, They're Alfi, Bustomi, Dany, Rohandi, Anang, Nanda, Ian, Ryan, Rohman,& Bondan. the most Pro in this game are Ian, Rohman, Bustomi & Nanda. the most deads are Anang & Rohandi coz only camper & cant aim xD . the Pro got an special ""abilty"" like Bustomi always great at Rescue the Hostage, Ian has a good Tactical & Rohman has a good aim. we played so much Fun, Best moment was Bustomi only Last Man Standing to kill all enemy Team (in this time it called ""ACE"").we all shootin' then die and repeat until 3 Hours passed, Win or Lose it doesnt matter for us, coz we got so much fun, sadly next week the wireless cable was Disconnected coz the teacher mad to other Class for Opening Porn in Computer class LMAO,

Those day i miss so much, it doesnt matter i got win or lose. only laughing at funny moments, camping without reason, dying then no blaming to each other, all i get is fun & fun. but Things changed since CSGO, there was a raging kid, toxic player, rush B & ""—Å—É–∫–∞"" words"

3530,"counter strike condition zero is a good game, despite the fact almost everyone hates it, its a great game to get in the bundle with cs 1.6, it features all the classic maps from 1.6 including updated versions as well, you get the ability to play against bots   right out of the gates instead of having to mod bots in like in 1.6, it features a mission mode, and it also comes packaged with the deleted scenes, which are 12 story mode missions that are quite impressive for the goldsource engine, and the guns have higher quality models, all in all this game gets a 10/10 from me as well 
its a must have for people getting cs 1.6 and condition zero bundle

This title has age a lot but not without some feel good memories, graphics are something out of a standup arcade system like Area 51 but was pretty good during it's release.

Game play is good and level design cared for, a nice throwback.

Sound engine lacks refinement and you will hear the age of this title.

Get CSGO or get this on sale."
3535,"The official sequel to the revolutionary game Counter Strike 1.6, made by Valve, the game has single player challenges with bots so playing offline is an option along with new weapons. But the main selling point is the single player campaign; deleted scenes, it takes place fighting terrorism across the globe in exotic locations. Simular to 1998 Half-Life, the campaign is still fun to play and it's story is alright.

Recommended to people who like classic games, people who play multiplayer, and people who like Half-Life style games."

3554,"Its counter-strike 1.6, but it has bots."
3555,"
The tactical squad-based shooter franchise Counter-Strike has had a long and storied history from humble beginnings as a GoldSrc deathmatching mod, to years of loyal followers as a title officially picked-up and supported by Valve, to the massive gaming icon and economic powerhouse that the most recent instalment - Global Offensive, has become. While having been surpassed technologically by more recent instalments, in this lowly reviewer‚Äôs opinion, Condition Zero remains the best in the series.

Controls and gameplay ought to seem familiar to most-anyone who has played a Valve title or have looked at a first-person PC game in this last two decades; all very basic and easy to learn - WASD to move, mouse to look, and a handful of other simple buttons to do things like bring up the score table and such. These simple controls and gameplay mechanics belie the massive upper skill ceiling which has kept Condition Zero veterans enthralled with the game for more than a decade. 

Gameplay objectives remain much the same as they were in CS1.6, pitting two teams of fully armed terrorists and counter-terrorists against each other across a number of tense bomb-disposal and hostage rescue situations in a test of strategic communication, flick reflexes, and tactical fund management. Where Condition Zero unquestionably excels over its peers is in all aspects of the singleplayer experience. CZ brings in full native AI bot support, and these cutting-edge-fourteen-years-ago opponents remain respectfully challenging in both organisational intelligence and in moment-to-moment gunplay. Furthermore, Condition Zero provides a new ‚ÄòTour of Duty‚Äô campaign wherein the player advances through eighty-four scenarios designed to test their mettle across every map and type of weapon. 

Despite a not-uncomplicated development cycle and sales figures actually along Valve‚Äôs lowest at release, the recognisable excellence of Condition Zero has ensured a healthy fanbase and playercount more than a decade later, and given the inexpense of this game, either bundled alongside the original 1.6 release and an admittedly poorer expansion-sequel, or as part of the Valve Complete Pack, this is definitely something to look out for during any one of Steam‚Äôs frequent sales.

Very thoroughly recommended.

3569,"CS:CZ has a long story so sit down and get some cup of Tea/Beer and Relax. CS:CZ has been Black Sheep for Counter Strike Family for a long time. CS:CZ¬¥s development had alot of issues. Rogue Entertainment started the development in 2000 but because of it¬¥s CEO or like that the Company went Defunct, Meaning the Development Was passed back to Turtle Rock Studios. Valve didn¬¥t really care much about CS:CZ because they were focusing more on Source Engine. Turtle Rock Studios did a great job updating Goldsrc engine¬¥s graphics. What do i mean by updating? It means they updated lighting,shading,shadows and gave Textures new breath by adding New Texture Compression Techniques. Counter Strike Condition Zero is split into 2 different Games: Condition Zero And Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. Ritual Entertainment had Deleted Scenes for their work and Turtle rock studios had normal Condition Zero. After it finally got on Audience¬¥s plates in 2004 ,They still didn¬¥t like it very much because of it¬¥s old Graphics and it felt similiarly to 1.6 . Valve Fixed this by releasing Counter Strike Source in late 2004. On the Bright side i find the campaigns/tour of Duties Entertaining and i recommend this game alot."
3570,"Excellent game to spend it with friends and have a good time with good Latin, American and European servers that have animated and friendly people, simply a work of art."

I could not be bothered with the multiplayer because I knew it was going to be exactly like Counter-Strike, sone.And somehow this game was worse than the previous one. I would only recommend getting this game in the valve bundle because that is one of the most essential things on steam. plus Valve made it and they also made half-life wich is a review for another time."
3575,This game hate wasn't warranted at all! But  i understand people just want to stay on 1.6 until Source came in.

3601,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero really isn't anything noteworthy. It is an upgrade of the original game, having minor improvements in sounds, vocal performances and other regards. The main factor which separates it from the other Counter-Strike entries is it's singleplayer campaign, which is comprised of multiple missions and challenges to complete. These missions only offer similar gameplay scenarios that can be found in multiplayer.
Many of the top reviews found here consist of people's fondness of the game due to nostalgia or the missions and challenges. I would recommend this game to those who may enjoy completing challenges and missions otherwise overall I would stick with 1.6 as there are more people currently playing it.
I would not recommend this game to you if it were required to be purchased seperately from 1.6 although since this game comes with the original for a total of $10 I would recommend that you purchase this bundle to experience both entries for yourself."

3606,"Sadly this game was cut down and made into a 1.6 HD reskin. The original plans for CS:CZ looked amazing, the idea of a molotov cocktail, the Galil and Famas all came from CZ's development. CS:CZ is an interesting piece of Counter-Strike History and a 'must play' for everyone interested in that."
3607,<3
3608,"Liked this game. Multiplayer and single player map challenges are nice.
Enjoyed the Deleted Scene campaign very much.
Recommended for FPS fans."
3609,Basically an updated 1.6
3610,If u play expert or hard mode you can be toxic easily.I can understand all of bots can be dangerous on this game.
3611,Really fun and reminds me what games where like in the past! I really reccomend this game to people who love old school games!!!
3612,nice
3613,this good

3615,"Valve: well ritual i made it despite your directions.
Ritual: ah company valve. welcome.
Ritual: i hope your prepared for an unforgettable game design
Valve: yeah.
*Ritual enters the game design studio and their deleted scenes is scrapped*
Ritual: OH EGADS! MY GAME IS RUINED
Ritual: but what if i were to share the development to another studio? delightfully devilish, ritual.
*Valve enters the room*
Valve: RITUUUAAAAAALLLLL
Ritual: valve! i was just uh totally stretching my team on the development. isometric studio exercise, care to join me?
Valve: why is the design still being worked by you?
Ritual: uhhh its turtle rock, game from turtle rock studios were having, mmm deleted scenes.
*Valve leaves the backroom* 
Ritual: phew
*fast forward 2004*
Ritual: valve i hope you're ready for deleted Scenes
Valve: i thought your not happy with that?
Ritual: d'oh no.
Ritual: i said Deleted Scenes
Ritual: thats what i call this.
Valve: you cal- you know what? okay.
Ritual: its a new dialect.
Valve: uh-huh, from what studio?
Ritual: uh, gearbox software.
Valve: really.
Valve: well we know gearbox, and i've never heard anyone use the phrase ""Deleted Scenes""
Ritual: oh not in gearbox, no its a turtle rock expression.
Valve: I see.
Valve: you know, this ""deleted scenes"" are quite similiar to the ones they have at turtle rock studios.
Ritual: ohhh no, patented ritual style, old gearbox design.
Valve: for Deleted scenes?
Ritual: yes.
Valve: yes, and you call them Deleted scenes despite the fact that you arent happy with it.
Ritual: ye- you know one thing i should- excuse me for one second
Valve: ofcourse.
*Ritual goes to the backroom and comes back in a few seconds*
Ritual: ah well that was wonderful, good game was contributed by me, im finished.
Valve: ah i shou- GOOD LORD WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THERE? 
Ritual: six unreleased missions.
Valve: unreleased missions!? at this time of the release in this part of the game localized entirely within your studio?
Ritual: yes.
Valve: may i see it?
Ritual: no
J.C: RITUAL THE MISSIONS ARE REMOVED!
Ritual: no sir thats just unfinished.
Valve: Well ritual you are an odd fellow but i must say you steam a good game."
3616,"The worst one of the series, yet the graphics are alot better than the 1.6 version."
3617,The only Counter Strike campaign.
3618,"Very good, but 1.6 still better. About Deleted Scenes -> Good fun for a afternoon, weird at first to play a Counter Strike game in a campaign, but it works and it's fun."
3619,awesome
3620,Nice
3621,This game is lub ‚ù§üòõ
3622,sd
3623,"Nostalgia. The first game I ever purchased and as a reward for myself after the Chinese middle-school final test. As a kid who had not been exposed to much games, I still remember the feeling of ""enlisting"" myself in the military game genre, despite that CS had been around even by the time I purchased it. Oh also, I bought it in my country China, where everyone plays pirated version of games. So yeah, It's obvious how excited I was with the game. 
And I wasn't disappointted. Despite several levels that have stupid design and had me stuck not knowing where to go(even till now I get lost in the first level), I am generally intrigued by the game and I had a good time playing with an old friend of mine. Good time, good time."
3624,"simply amazing and multiplayer is good 
also can play with bots"
3625,"Guess I'm the last person on Earth to get into CS
Freaking addictive stuff, delete it if you have deadlines."
3626,cs is like any other arena mp game with teams in a military theam to me. all boring
3627,"The worst of counter strike series, but its dirt cheap on sale, so recommended."
3628,begin starting game why can't play. are u seriosly lie me?
3629,Good Game
3630,"I got this game while the valve complete pack was on sale, so it was basically free. I've enjoyed it so far, the multiplayer is dead, but the singleplayer features are still fun."
3631,"i was straight out of college i had no family no job no wife no dignity and especially no house. but this business man went up to me and said this could be mine for 2 bucks. i happily obliged and now i am in serious hell. i was expecting a kinda dirty apartment with a small microwave and a ok kitchen but what i got sucked, it was filled with pit vipers and boa constrictors. they doubled teamed me and now i am getting the choke a boa constrictor offers and the tissue dissolving and necrosis a pit viper offers. this is great, i always wanted to die at the ripe age of 22. dont fall for this scam it is not worth it. icpfan no.1 out if you want to spend your money just buy a vinyl copy of the great milenko album by icp, that right there has some hardcore songs on it."
3632,No russians are there
3633,Fail
3634,"I personally think that this remake is better than the original one, sure okay, the original one was made by valve, which means it is uncomparable, but to think that an amateur company is able to do this, makes me realise that somethings just can never be remade, but they sure did one hell of a good job recreating and even adding. Waiting for the Xen release like a dog waiting for food :D"
3635,SEBELUM MAIN CSGO MAIN INI DULU KL MAU JAGO !!
3636,great game for cheap! 10/10
3637,"Story & Campaign: The campaign? You do the same thing as your normal day to day game, unless you need to complete some challanges to proceed that gets harder and harder

Rating: ( 3/10) But, no one does judge CS based on story so I am going to let this one through 

Gameplay: This is as basic as it can get and no, I am not talking about the 1.6 version because it does not have bots if you want to play offline 
Rating: (10/10)

Soundtrack: No one does judge CS based on soundtrack 
Rating: (Not Applicable/10) 

Graphics: As great as a glass of old wine, to think that this game came out in 2004, it does hold up great against newer CS games like Source & GO
Rating: (9/10)

Final Rating: (8/10)

This game is old but gold. A great start to be one of the biggest game series in the gaming industry. Even against all odds, there are still matches played online in this game and I recommend get it while on sale


"
3638,Left college lectures bunked classes learn abuse from this game in various other languages cuisines totally worth it to spent whole life playing this game üòç
3639,For people who don't have internet
3640,"I don't know how nobody knew this Counter-Strike game existed, good game though."
3641,"3rd best counter strike game, but the single player mode does get really repetitive but still a game to play once in a while 8/10"
3642,"I love Condition Zero simply because there are missions. It's as if you're playing CS mixed with a linear-styled game. I would recommend this game as there are various missions, teammates to choose from, difficulties and challenges to complete."
3643,"Thia game has stopped working on its own, we are unable to update the game or play it, can you help us with a solution to this issue!"
3644,This is my second FPS game i've played to be a gamer when I was 11 years old. I was playing this game (pirated version) everyday back then and today finally I can buy the original version.
3645,its ok its not better than cs 1.6 and csgo
3646,"10/10 PUB servers, DM servers are still active!, Impressive!"
3647,‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ
3648,"It's 1.6, but with prettier textures and different reloading animations and sound effects for some reason. I guess people didn't like the single player mission based gameplay."
3649,Fun when you want to play solo or get bored of online games. Highly recommend it
3650,1337
3651,"The game is a 5/10.
I've made pros and cons for you to see.
PROS:
-Weapons are remastered
-Sounds are better
-Vocals actually sound like normal people
-Movement sounds sound better
-Good character modeling.

CONS:
-Stupid npcs
-Bad map making(i was playing the story mode and i could not find the fucking point,i could not find the place i had to go to,i nocliped everywhere on the map)
-horrible m4,the weapon is mde ugly,sounds are shit,and the looks are just horrible.
-Stupid stories,they have no point at all,that run mission was stupid,you could not find the place you had to go to.
-HD models make the game harder,you cant distinguish betwen ct and t with the hd models on.play with them off.


the game is a 5/10.
People like it some people dont.
if you do like it than have fun.


I recommend playing multiplayer,its least worse than the campaign."

3658,best cs if you wanna play with bots
3659,"Never Played this game Online but the ""Campaing Mode"" is awesome. What's good about buying this game is you get CS 1.6 for free!! I love Deleted Scenes they are the best in my opinion."
3660,GG 10/10 would play again
3661,"Amazing game. Even playing this game in 2018. Good Old games never die. 
But I think in the Condition Zero missions why are all the snipers lower skilled than the others bots. and please remove the sh*t tactical shield challenges and from BOTS like Travis or Brent! Shield su*ks. Also CPU players in my team never purchases defusal kit. Sniperers and Machine gunners sometimes goes mad and start shooting rapidly without enemies. 
And last of all challenges in the expert mode are stupid. kill with knife???
One more unfair rule in missions. All of the terrorist opponents use (mostly) Ak-47. But in my team there are only a few players with rifle. What we have is shield???"
3662,Nadie conoce esto
3663,i love the old cz
3664,"I was surprised by how well-made this game is, it's very fun as well. I got it for $0.99 in the summer sale, which is an absolute steal. The A.I. is advanced and ahead of its time and it feels relatively realistic (note: this game was released in 2004). I highly recommend you get this game, especially if it's on sale."

3681,"I know that this game is dead but i can't resist it, all my friends play here so i stick with this. there is not much difference in cs 1.6 and cz but i must say 1.6 is better"
3682,is a shit game
3683,"It is the black sheep of the Counter Strike series. However, I found it more enjoyable than CS:GO."
3684,Such a rip off from csgo!!! dont buy omgggg >>>>....<<<<<
3685,Very Good Game ! I recommend everyone to buy it !
3686,I first tried CS-CZ back at college and was immediately addicted. One of the most beloved and popular games of its kind. I recently ganged up with my colleagues for a competition and was naturally hooked up again! Way to go CS!
3687,cool
3688,:/
3689,just play 1.6
3690,very nice and lot of fun
3691,"With Source coming out a few months later, poor game didn't have a chance, it is not a bad game, just missunderstood."
3692,OK
3693,this game is very good
3694,"Its a great expirence for me rigth now..
Its fun to play the DELETED SCENE 

in hard mode sometimes it gaves me head ache because of the game itself..

but its fun"
3695,It's like Counter-Strike 1.6 but with better graphics and crosshair is actually useful
3696,My father still playing until now...A mission focus FPS game might be very good for causal old timer.
3697,Dead game but fun game
3698,"2nd generation of counter-strike series, the gameplay is good but they like removing wallbang spot that make a sense, and with the better grapich and performing a new colour of counter-strike.."

3700,One Of The Oldest Game But Its Like A Gold ..!! xD
3701,Very nice storyline and good cutscenes combined with a nice gameplay <3
3702,"Now as a surprise for me, this was my favourite game of the Counter-Strike series so far, I played the game with no hopes since I don't like the CS series, but this one is different because of the missions tab which I like a lot, I like challenges and missions. So yeah, if you are looking for a counter-strike game that you can also play with fun singleplayer, you should pick this game up!"
3703,im just playing it because it reminds me of swat4
3704,Best Childhood Game...

3709,"[h1]Play counter strike but now with Riot Shields![/h1]
A campaign singleplayer (and online multiplayer) game, where you and your team of npc's fight against terrorists who want to destroy the entire world!
8/10.
As me, I love this type of games, wish there was coop."
3710,"Great Counter Strike Bot game, 10/10 when I played it 16 years ago.

When I came back and played it again, it was a reminder of the classic game dynamic of 1.6 cs.  This is a great game to learn how to play cs against bots, it also gives you the opportunity to view maps that are no longer available in matchmaking rotations for majors.

This game can be purchased for very cheap in an orange box bundle, in a cs bundle, or by itself during winter sales.  Keep an eye out.

I have hundreds of hours on my old Sierra games account with this game - played this game again for 5 minutes to review almost 15 years later!

If you start to have problems on the hardest difficulty against the bots;
Remember -  sv_gravity 0, and sv_gravity 1000 kills all the bots and wins you games :)."
3711,CROWNFUL 5 Quart Air Fryer
3712,its ok. its basically like playing Bomb Defusal Missions but with bots. the Deleted Scenes are much better and have a story to them.
3713,best evergreen game. still not bored.
3714,"First of all, It's counter-strike so its very diffuclt. But it has a lot of bugs, like how you have jump on a pipe to progress, or how it autosaved above two enemy's while I was at low health. But I loved it. (And yes, I hate the multiplayer.)"
3715,Shhh... your not supposto be seeing this its a deleted scene!
3716,ok
3717,Classic
3718,The new 1.6. It's fine I guess.
3719,"ADDENDUM: I just realized that this game already comes when you buy the original and vice-versa. So..... Just get this shit already!

Counter-Strike Condition Zero.... what can i say about this game?.... well it's.... Counter-Strike (Original) with some added seasoning. Would i reccomend it? Of course! But let's crack it down a bit more. 

GRAPHICS: Great.
The graphics on this game are reworked versions of the orginal CS versions. They look fantastic and it's hard to belive this wasn't a source game.

SOUNDTRACK: Un-rated.
For obvious reasons, the soundtrack is limited to the main menu and shit. Because during the match every footstep is valuable information and music can get in the way of hearing it. So i'm not giving it a rating for the soundtrack since this isn't a game that should require a soundtrack. 

GAMEPLAY: Great.
The gameplay is about the same as the original CS. Which means it's great! 

CAMPAIGN: Eh..... it's ok...ish
Now here comes the kick in the nuts.... The Campaign of the game is just the same thing as regular matches with the added seasoning of Challenges like: 
""Kill 5 enemies""
""Kill an enemy with a sub machinegun"" and stuff like that. 
It's nothing special. They could have gone for so much more, yet they decided on so little. 

STORY: Un-rated.
The game is story-less which means i can't rate it. Well ""story-less"" the story you all know, a team of counter-terrorists is sent to ""negotiate"" with the terrorists in an area. Same old shit, but it works. 

CONCLUSION: 10/13
The game is a great game and a worthy addition to your steam library..... unless you already have the original game, in which case, you are just buying the same game twice. If you don't have the original, get this one. If you have the original, Don't get this one, you're just wasting your money. Maybe not like that.
 
NOTE: Multiplayer was not taken into account when writing this review."
3720,HUJOWE
3721,YEAH
3722,the undisputed champion of all fps games. all time favorite. runs everywhere.
3723,"You can tell that they tried their best to make a good shooter but failed. Oh wait, its from 2004, the year when SHREK 2 CAME OUT. There is no excuse for this terrible game."
3724,"True classics never die!
This game got me into LAN gaming. 
The campaign is true nostalgia that i relive now and then.
(Y)"
3725,Classic
3726,very good
3727,Original.
3728,"The good: 
-Bots are amazing and are better then those in most modern shooters
-The maps are very well designed,I never felt like I was playing the the same mode twice
-Intresting team building idea, alllows a user to have a team set-up to fit there preferences and getting one more point after completing a mission feels progressive and rewarding.
-Easy to access settings for local multiplayer with bots, for example if you want to have a massive machine gun battle or have a Sniper battle you can easily do so
-In the multiplayer there's is a vast selection of maps
-Runs well on terrible computers
The bad:
-Bots won't defuse if your alive and all the enemies are dead, this is my biggest criticism of the game as even if there are 7 bots on the bombsite yet your all the way across the map, they still won't defuse
-Bot performance is very inconsistent, for example bot Tex was extremely good on one mission, so I kept him in my load out for the next mission where he only got four kills
-There is a lack of diversity in the challenges you are required to do, they always involve either getting kills with a certain weapon, hostage rescues and total kills.
-The game seems to lack a proper skill curve, as certain earlier missions end up being harder then ones you receive later on.
-The last three sets of missions are overwhelming difficult because for some reason friendly bots performe very poorly so if you do not get 1. 4 or more kills per round and 2. Lucky these missions are almost impossible

Overall I would recommend picking up this game even with it's flaws, and would rate it as a 7/10 for it's genre


"
3729,Reviving.......!
3730,Good
3731,NICE
3732,good
3733,"atleast it has some different mechanics than the original counter strike. but the sounds and graphics are not that good. 3.5/10 would play again tho.

edit: ok i just realised that this review is for condition zero deleted scenes too so here is a review on deleted scenes:
pretty good but again the sounds and some graphics are awful. the missions are funny to play tho. the dumb thing is that there are no checkpoints, if you get killed you need to start over."
3734,Ok
3735,good
3736,its my life
3737,waawa
3738,Good game. No hacker cheater unlike CSGO. But very boring ...

3743,reeee

3745,very good
3746,I did this for XP
3747,g
3748,Shit
3749,This is by far the worst counter strike ever produced. It is barely a game
3750,call of strike : counter warfare
3751,Good game! Atleast there no no hackers
3752,"This game is pretty good, but it's definitly outshined by counter strike source and counter strike global offensive"
3753,"A bunch of dirty boys try to make a huge mess and hassle people, so these nice policemen have to set them straight, but the competence of the entire force depends on one single man and his decisions."
3754,I bought this game on sale mostly just to play the campaign it has. It was a very enjoyable campaign overall I recommend if enjoy half-life era campaigns. The actual story is in the Delete Sceen game that comes with it and not in the main Game.
3755,no bhopping allowed in this game :-(
3756,From the best fps game
3757,"actually a good cs game


10/10 it has story"
3758,"Good company game, but lil bit unfinished m-player)"
3759,Looks beautiful and offers different gameplay settings and features various mechanics and a nice storytelling
3760,cool for me
3761,Worst CS game that exist
3762,"Only try this game when you are a counterstrike fan and want a good laugh. The game is complete shit and the terrible attempt at what is supposed to be a story feels just painfull. Drunk it is a solid 8/10 and but you need to pay me a good amount of money to touch this sober. There is a great number of games out there that aged well, but this is not one."
3763,"The old days, man this game is great. Wish CSGO had a story mode."
3764,idk
3765,gay
3766,"1.6 but single player based, with missions."
3767,"Not really a fan of it , i preffer CS 1.6"
3768,"This is a review for the 'Deleted scenes', because Steam won't let me review it separately.

Fan of the old CS games? Try this out.
This game is pretty much just a singleplayer game, but with the textures and physics of the original CS:CZ, hence the name.
Now I won't go in depth about what happens in the game in order to not spol it for anyone, but the beginning has to be my favorite part. A helicopter drops you off into the desert, and stuff goes down.
Positive sides would be mostly nostalgic, but don't get me wrong, it's a pretty good game. Just not by today's standards.
The AI is clumsy and at times very annoying. Sometimes you have no clue about where you should go, what you should do etc., which isn't necessarily what you'd expect from a game in the Counter-Strike series. It's not a puzzle game, it's a shooter. Or is it?
Overall as the game is, I'd give it a 3/10, because while it's not a complete piece of garbage, it just doesn't work as we nowadays expect games to work. It's an old game."
3769,You have to play Counter Strike Condition Zero to review Deleted Scenes
3770,the game is dead
3771,muy bueno
3772,nice
3773,.
3774,"Bots Beginner level = They can't get one kill

Hard = They seem like aimbot lmao"
3775,"I found this really fun, if not a bit confusing on the multiplayer side of things. Runs great on any computer post 2000, so if you can't run CS:GO, this is pretty good. Singleplayer campaign is really fun, and the bots are pretty smart compared to others I've seen"
3776,the earth is flat
3777,nostalgia
3778,its Counter Strike 1.7!
3779,Good game. Especially the Tour of Duty is awesome
3780,One of the most best plot lines of Cs games.
3781,Shit
3782,Pretty good I guess
3783,this game is good and this game has a thing that csgo doesn't have that is throwback
3784,This game is amazing af. Totally recomended 10/10
3785,"I don't like story mode but is OK, just like 1.6"
3786,"I actually like this.
Dont buy it on steam lol ;)"
3787,"It is a more refined and updated CS: 1.6. This fact was very disappointing when it came out because it was very outdated by 2004 standards (Same year that Half Life 2 and the Source Engine came out), but for today it acts as a vastly improved time capsule of early CS history and nostalgia with the added benefits of native bot support and a neat little campaign against challenging AI. One thing it has going for it is how much smoother the game is compared to 1.6. The graphics are a lot better, and basically everything related to gameplay has been improved. I'd say it is worth your money more than 1.6 only if you like playing with bots and want a better experience with that. Condition Zero does not have nearly the same playerbase as 1.6 does and there are not many servers. Great game nonetheless.
(Btw I have a lot more hours on this game that predate me grabbing a digital copy)"

3792,"Rating: 9/10

This games is good because it has kind of like a campaign which is fun, and different. You can play against bots of all difficulties in normal scrims too. The guns also feel much more accurate and smoother than the original counter strike, that's what i like the most. I can't give it a perfect rating because the servers are definitely far from populated which lowers it's quality."

3799,"[h1]COUNTER STRIKE WHERE YOU KNOW WHAT SHOULD YOU DO[/h1]

Normally, counter strike is a fps game that you only need to bang-bang-and-win. no need to have spesific weapon to win. [strike]you can get your P90 and RUSH B! or get an AWP and stick in the base[/strike]. in this CS series that typical player will not able to finish all missions. fyi, there's a mode called mission mode. it has 4 AI-Brains stupidity (lol) and you must do some phew-phew-and-boom/or sort of [i]""follow me sir""[/i] things to pass a level/map. Anyway, this game is recommended for people who want to reminisce with old-school game.
[b]Pros:[/b]
(+) Mission Mode
(+) Good graphic (for 2004's games of course)
(+) Multiplayer mode never die!
(+) can play through LAN
(+) there's many maps

[b]Cons[/b]
(-) old game (from i wrote this review in 2018)
(-) too much hacker
(-) there are no more update (the last update was mid 2017)

[b]SCORE
9/10 for 2004's game
8/10 for 2018 standard[/b](though it still has a good gameplay)"

I may have played this game less on steam but I had the game on another account in which I have played over a 1000 hrs.
I finished the game's  career mode multiple times and nothing has been able to meet that experience.
No other game is better than this one.

3813,"The missions have so many moments that you don't even know what happened. NOT REALISTIC AT ALL VERY SHITTY Not to mention how stupidly fucking hard it is to figure out were you're going sometimes. Another thing is how when you die if you're shooting you spawn back shooting, you lose ammo and IT HAPPENS VERY OFTEN."

If you're wanting a gold source engine era counter-strike, this is the one for you, just don't expect much people to be on."
3819,Good Game
3820,"This game is incompletable, on the second mission its almost impossible not to destroy your computer at the sheer unrealistic feacures of this game. You shoot an enemy at point blank range with a shotgun he doesn't die, you shoot him in the head he doesn't die. Don't bother wasting your money on this game, its old and its just going to make you rage."

3850,"Dated and buggy. Maybe it was a fun game back when it first came out but it feels very underwhelming, considering this was released the same year as Source.

I had a quick go on multiplayer but I was actually interested in trying out the Deleted Scenes (campaign mode). I abandoned the campaign during the second mission. The level design is confusing and the hit detection is practically broken. The graphics are also really ugly (even for 2004).

Just get Counter Strike: GO and don't waste your time with this one.

Gameplay: 3/10
Graphics: 4/10 (for the time)

Replay Value: 1/10"

Well, this was fun when it came out, and I played it again just for laughs March 2018. It was still fun, but playing CS-GO several years now,  it would be great if Valve can modernize this instead or dumping another useless case on the community. Maybe one day, but to me, this was just fun for one last run through."

Still it's cs 1,6 with better gun and character models.
Definitely worth if you'd like to Practice with bots unlike from 1.6 which they don't have it.
or even Play the story if you're into stories like Half-life etc."
3869,???
3870,"I got this game mainly for the single-player campaign, The Deleted Scenes. As a first-time Counter-Strike player, it took me a while to learn the shooting mechanics, but I found the game quite entertaining and only now can I fully understand why the series is so popular. Granted, the graphics are dated and the AI can be brain-dead at times, but the missions are diverse and the objectives are generally fun.
Then there is the base game and its tour of duty missions, with challenges that I found boring, and of course the multiplayer mode. I only have a limited CS multiplayer experience, but the servers were easy to find and the game itself was fun.
Despite some of its shortcomings, this game is definitely recommended, even for the Deleted Scenes single-player campaign. And besides, what other games let you play as a left-handed character?

3903,"I have been playing Counter-Strike since before the days of Steam and I can say that for me (I know, no one cares) CS:CZ was the very best form of CS. I may be biased because I was heavy into the community many, many years ago and played it competitively at the highest level, but generally I just think that the maps were the best, the models were the best, and the game felt the absolute smoothest any CS has ever felt. It's essentially 1.6 but less wonky and better looking (Though I know that doesn't really matter because we never loved CS for its looks). The nostalgia I feel for this game is crazy. I just discovered today that this game had trading cards produced back in the day which are selling for 30 bucks on EBay and I might just be crazy enough to go buy them xD If you are at least a little curious about the hidden gem in the CS franchise history and haven't played around with this yet, I recommend you do so and at least check out CZ's take on many maps (like Dust2_cz and Inferno_cz), it will not disappoint! #topcz"
3904,Nostalgia Trip
3905,"Holy f*ck, those aren't deleted scenes, this is a whole game! i liked condition zero, but this is a big step up in animation, story, missions... way more complex and exigent. amusingly, missions are close to the kind of things we would find in a CoD, just a bit cheaper :) just get a pack : cs, cs:cz, cs:cz deleted scenes on sales, you won't regret it"

3945,"It's not the best game in the franchise of Counter-Strike, but the thing I like about this game is it's Singleplayer Campaign. I really wished CS:GO had a singerplayer mode with missions and all that, and this one does. Now, I am not talking about ""Deleted Scenes"", but the offline game with bots you can recruit before you do the mission. It really gives this game a little bit of replay-ability, replay-ab--, reoeroierjgoeljpji, or however you say it.

The animations are not bad, and the overall gameplay is really nice. I was expecting more to be honest but, the only thing we got for this game is some new models for both factions, new animations, sounds, and maps (by that I mean the fact that the maps looked different, but they were pretty much the same.

The thing is: is it worth buying? Eh.. if you can, try to buy it when it's on Steam Sale or something, since I won't pay ~10 euros just for CS 1.6 with Singerplayer Missions/Campaign. I really love the maps in the campaign, though it feels a bit inclosed for me. Would've loved if they were a bit more opened.

It's just Counter-Strike Classic (aka 1.6) with a singerplayer campaign. I'll give it an 8/10"

3960,"This game is very similar to the original Counter Strike, however it has some additions like bots, remade maps and slightly improved graphics. The game also has a single player campaign which took me around 27 hours to complete (across all 4 difficulty levels). It's nothing special, just 18 maps with bots and specific challenges that you must complete in order to pass the mission, however it's still a bit of fun and something to do when you have free time. The multiplayer of this game is not as popular as the original Counter Strike's, so if you're looking for populated servers, the original Counter Strike is the way to go. Overall this game is great - it's the good old Counter Strike, with some welcome improvements."
3961,SOLID GAME..
3962,"Easily the worst in the series. Counter-Strike Condition Zero is a buggy mess that has so many problems it ruins the gameplay for me. I tried to give it chance, but it keeps frustrating me with all its deffects. Was the game rushed? Or did the devs just not care. Well, it's been over 10 years and it looks like that's the answer! If this game has been patched I'm afraid to ask what did it look like before the ""fixes"".

It's only saving grace (although very buggy, too) is the Tour Of Duty campaign mode and the abilty to make custom campaigns yourself.
If you wanna enjoy a Counter-Strike game- go play CS 1.6 or CS Source, GO, etc.

p.s. I was wondering why almost no one of my friends owns this game and now I know why."

3981,"You should own one a long time ago, why not?"
3982,CS 1.6 + campaign = CS:CZ
3983,"This game includes another expansion pack free, Counter-Strike: Condition zero Deleted scenes. I'll Review the main game first.

""Counter-Strike: Condition Zero"" 5/10

CS:CZ Is a bot oriented game, And the bots are smart too. So exploit their tactics, It'll be a rinse & repeat if you die once.
But Overall, It's somewhat ok, It does have Exclusive maps to this game. So You could port it to CS 1.6.

""Counter-Strike: Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes"" 9/10

CSCZDS. A Very long short version of the title, But I works. Or CZDS. But This is my Favorite.
CZDS Is a Campaign based version of CSCZ, And It's amazing, You should think of it as Half-Life. But here are my descriptions of the Diffuculties.

Easy: I Want to kick ass at my own pace.

Medium: A Euphemism for normal.

Hard: 1st Person hotline miami.

Also, There are soldiers with rockets too.
Thank you to the Develepors of CZDS For making this awesome expansion!! :steamhappy:

3984,Beschdes Game ever
3985,good
3986,So let me make this a quick review. First of all if you love cs1.6 and idk if you are tierd of playing online (or maybe you have no interent access for a period of time) you are going to love this game ! Personaly I love to play this it does not have the best graphics it's defintley dated but you should give it a try becuse it is so much fun ! 9/10 would spend 5‚Ç¨ again (btw you get the story mode and cs1.6 if you buy this so it's a win win situation)
3987,I like this game very much because this game is fun.
3988,Even not a great game but it still a masterpeice of this game
3989,"This review mainly applies to CS:CZ Deleted Scenes, as CS:CZ just adds bots and objectives like ""Kill 3 enemies with a sniper rifle"" and is generally alright.

As for Deleted Scenes: This is the most confused & confusing version of CS ever.

Walking through the training mission, everything starts out like you'd expect for a single player version of CS, standard M4A1 intro, AWP and grenades. Plus a RC wall explosive (why not...), a radio that you can only use in specific locations (which makes it more like a phone booth), a camera that follows the same rule, and a fiberoptic device to spy on people through keyholes (think Rainbow Six, but it only works on select doors).

Then the game starts, and it's a mess. A heavily stereotyped mix of guys in a white turban starts yelling in what sounds like Arabic and attacking you. Some of them are basically Psychos from Borderlands, attacking you with machetes. Others are snipers, but they first aim at you with a laser. You may be familiar with these concepts from literally no version of CS ever.
They go down like flies, as any good bad guy should, and then you get stuck because the level layout is fucking awful, 90% of doors don't open and of those that do, at least half lead to dead ends (after you've gunned down the enemies behind them). The first friendly ""sniper"" you meet then tries to melee enemies with his AWP and dies, failing the mission instantly.

This is not a good game. If you want a CS single player, play the regular CS:CZ or just add bots to any other version of CS."
3990,Beautiful FPS game i like it so much
3991,Good game. It's that bad tbh. Good for those with low end pc.
3992,"COD done right by Counter Strike

3993,Its just HL2 but with a bad campaign.

4010,"In a world full of sophisticated games, this gold and simple game keeps entertaining me every hour so far :) Visit the hack guy on youtube"
4011,"A sequel to the venerable Counter-Strike, only this time with upgraded graphics, a singple-player campaign, and the introduction of a few new maps, essentially what Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is. I must admit, I was bewildered as to why such a game existed as it came in a Counter-Strike bundle I had ordered for ¬£7 - which included Counter-Strike, Condition Zero + Deleted Scenes, and Global Offensive - so when I booted up the game, I was in for what I could only describe as the story mode version of Counter Strike.

The game presents Tour of Duty missions, each in their own unique maps, and gives you the ability before the fight to assemble a team, with each soldier having their own statistics which will affect their behavioural and combat abilities. Once you get into the mission, there are different objectives such as ""Kill an enemy with a sniper rifle"" or ""Rescue a hostage"" which compliment the gameplay and add a unique sidequest while you actively seek victory for your team you compiled.

Being the sequel to the exalted Counter-Strike, there is still a multi-player option available, just don't be surprised with the lack of active servers, for that you'll want to return to Counter-Strike 1.6 or go up a generation altogether.

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a polyphony of single-player and multi-player, with a wholesome single-player campaign which doesn't steer away from the game's core mechanics.

If you've never touched a Counter-Strike game before and want to have a go at one, you can't go wrong with picking Condition Zero as the starting grid to your Counter-Strike journey."

4013,very good! this is a nostalgia! back then i always play on my Dad laptop. i really want to buy it (cause i played on the cracked one) and finally can buy it cause -90% of discount! recommended!
4014,"counter strike is best bought in a bundle or on sale
while it is a good game with pretty awsome single player mode with missions and challenges along with team customization,
for the full price i dont think it is worth it now but the single player in my opinion $2.99 and i would happily pay that price just for the single player"

CS:CZ has good bot support and a VERY good single-player campaign that isn't even DLC.
When you download the game Deleted Scenes (single-player campaign) automaticly apeares in your library.
To be honest, the single-player campaign is probably the best thing about the game.
This is a very good game, and I hope valve would take inspiration from this game with their new CS game."
4036,good
4037,Its a decent game but its fun seeing how much detail they put and funny seeing how they made their maps. I think the gameplay is outdated.
4038,gg
4039,the bots are better than most csgo players.

4052,"Best game ever , more than csgo"
4053,"So basically. This is 1.6 with better graphics. Same gameplay, same everything really. But still I recommend it to everyone."
4054,"Counter Strike Condition Zero:
+ A little modification of graphics in Gold Source Engine.
+ Good gameplay is fun like the previous  game Counter-Strike 1.6 but less players.
Edit:+ The singleplayer campaign is the first one in Counter-Strike series and is fun to play it."
4055,"I used to play this to practice agains expert bots. Still, can't beat the expert level of it. So, for casual gaming, I bought this for less than $1. Worth every penny. But still, I suck at FPS games. So, This game is a better chooice for me to play casual FPS gaming rather than CS:GO, CoD, Battlefield, or Arma III."

4057,"Another childhood memories in world of PC games. Nice product to have to complete your collection, especially FPS or Counter-Strike fans out there."
4058,"Most people might avoid this game since for one, its old, but it also has terrible graphics
However, the game really is fun to play, because (at least in my experience) its not as ragey as its older brother, cs:go. 
The game is simpler, easier to run, and has not only multiplayer, but a campaign mode which I have been having way to much fun with. I reccomend this if you can handle the graphics. If you're still not convinced, people still play this game.

Bought steam version that cost me next to nothing, having sold 10 winter sale cards

It works flawlessly in linux."
4066,Good game very cunter striek
4067,ONE OF THE WORST version of counter strike ever played even cso has good controls and at least tell you how to play this just tells you thing you already know DON'T BUY WASTE OF MONEY!!!

The classics about the old counter strike.

-Great servers.
-Better hit boxes and guns; Guns arent hyper accurate like in CSS. Killing someone isnt as easy.
-Has the shield. Whether you like it or not, the option I still prefer. 
-Slicker skins I prefer more. I like the skin for some of the characters better than in css.
-WAY better maps and more than CSS. Downed, and the old Assault map, along with many more that were left out or changed in source. Sadly.
-The scout looks personally better to me.
-The guns all dont feel like clones like in source."

4094,I am having so much fun killing everyone and respawn and be killed again. I had enough so much for FPS and it's so loud feels like a never ending war LoL.
4095,"[h1]!!Important note!![/h1]
I have only played Counter-strike condition zero Deleted scenes


[u]What I liked about the game[/u]
[list] 
[*]	A surprisingly long campaign. It took me about 9 hours to complete the deleted scenes. 

[*]	 A Large selection of weapons, which are satisfying to use. 

[*]	The missions take place all over the world. You will Join different counter-strike squads from around the world (British, USA, Japanese and Russia). 

[*]	Plenty of gore and violence; Lots of head popping and bodies exploding. 

[*]	The levels are well designed with plenty of hidden secrets. The levels reminded me of the ones in Half-life. 

[*]	Awesome training level; better than half-life‚Äôs and opposing force‚Äôs training level.

[*]	I liked the equipment you got to use, like the welding torch and the optic camera. 

[*]	Good Varity of terrorists to kill; From a machete wielding nutter or a suicide bomber to a gun wielding terrorist. The A.I is also pretty good.      

[*]	Not overly realistic. It‚Äôs not like Rainbow six or Ghost recon, the gameplay is more like half-life. 

[*]	Good soundtrack.          

[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u]

[*]	Its Shame you can‚Äôt use the iron sights on some of the other weapons, like the M16. 

[*]	There isn‚Äôt really a story. The missions aren‚Äôt connected in any way. Its just different counter strike operations. 

[*]	It‚Äôs a shame you can‚Äôt pick ammo from enemies. 

[*]	Some of the levels are quite short.

[*]	There‚Äôs no memorable protagonists or antagonists. 

[*]	Would have been nice if you could carry your own first aid kit and able to use it anytime you want.  

[u]Conclusion[/u] 

Better than I thought. The single player campaign was longer than I expected. I didn‚Äôt expect much, especially with counter-strike beginning more focused on online multiplayer.  You get three games; counter-strike, counter-strike condition zero and counter-strike condition zero deleted scenes. If you like military types games or half-life, then I highly recommend you play this game. I wish they would introduce a single player Campaign into the later games.  

[h1]8/10[/h1]"

4098,"An internet cafe game classic.

I prefer CS:Source over this because it's CS:CZ with an updated engine but still have that CS 1.6 feeling.

But, it still had a great campaign, so play it!"
4099,it took me 39 hours to realize grenades don't bounce
4100,i dont like it
4101,"The game is Counter-Strike 1.6 with slightly better graphics and a smaller playerbase. The single-player campaign is a complete joke. Basically watching a movie. OOH you can call the radio HERE but if you move two inches away from this dot then you cannot use it at all. There are lots of items like this. This game out THE SAME YEAR AS HALF-LIFE 2. Just get that game instead, or Garry's Mod, or Counter-Strike: Source, or Counter-Strike 1.6, or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, or all of them. Just not this game."

4111,"[b]Intro[/b]
Note: This is a review of the Deleted Scenes campaign only. The content/replayability score does take in other modes however.

[b]The Great:[/b]
++N/A

[b]The Good:[/b]
+Sound design's actually somewhat decent with some really punchy weapon effects and half-decent environmental effects
+There's something oddly enjoyable about Gold Source's engine despite its annoying quirks. I honestly can't put my finger on it, but I'm sure plenty of people can relate.
+There's some bonus levels outside of the campaign
+The combat isn't totally without its' merits

[b]The Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:[/b]
+-The devs actually managed to do some impressive things with the engine. Animating dead bodies to look like true ragdoll as in other games for one, and animating crumpling paper and crushing boxes for some more. I don't know how they managed to do some of it on the engine, but it actually does a good job of mimicking
real physics. It absolutely doesn't save this game's presentation, though.
-+The voice acting isn't the worst thing in the world but it's certainly not good, and the phony accents don't help

[b]The Bad:[/b]
-If you're below 25 health, all you can really do is pray to the RNG gods that both the enemy will decide to miss you and that your weapons will be accurate, which aren't often the case. So sometimes you'll go around a corner and die over and over until you get lucky and the enemies decide to miss and your bullets
decide to hit where you're aiming.
-Hit detection is awful, and I know I'm not mistaking it for inaccurate weaponry
-Reload animations are annoyingly long
-Movement is as slippery as Half-Life's, but much slower. Given how many thin ledges and platforming is required from you, I have to wonder who thought giving the character roller-skates was a good idea.
-The campaign is very short. Under 4 hours even on Hard. There are some bonus maps, however.
-Enemy placement is BS sometimes, but especially on the last level
-There is no story. There are settings and objectives for each level, but they're totally self-contained.
-It's barely a challenge for at least half the game, but then the enemy placements get more annoying and it starts kicking your butt some more
-Music's forgettable
-The stealth sections work about as well as you'd expect on this engine. Thankfully, they're rare and cheese-able.
-There's a really annoying glitch where loading a save makes you fire automatically until you press the fire button yourself. It got me killed many times.
-The FOV is too small and can't be changed

[b]The Horrible:[/b]
--This game came out in 2004... two thousand and fucking four. Yet, it barely looks better than the original Half-Life, which ALREADY looked out of date 6 years ago! To compare this game visually to Half-Life 2, Doom 3, Thief Deadly Shadows, or, you know, ANY game released in 2004, is like comparing the U.S. healthcare
to any other first-world country -- it's nothing but a laughing stock.
--Counter-Strike's trademark nonsensical, ridiculous recoil system made playing this more and more annoying. It's often up to RNG as to whether you'll actually hit anything thanks to random weapon spread mixed with strong recoil. Sometimes you can get two easy headshots without a problem, and sometimes you'll miss
even with your crosshair clearly right on their head and even shots point blank at their body. It's just absurd.
--Incredibly repetitive. Shoot similar types of braindead enemies over and over while planting a bomb or pulling out a gadget every now and then.

Sound: 5.5/10
Graphics: 2/10
Gameplay: 4/10
Content/Replayability: 8/10
Overall: 4.5/10

[b]Conclusion[/b]
Not a dreadful experience, but I can't recommend it. Good for a nostalgia trip if you played this at the time, or just to kill a few hours, but that's about it. I'm sure you have better things to do and games to waste your life on. I don't, that's why I bothered to finish it."
4112,a good counter strike
4113,"Probably the best age of empires game (In my opinion)
- Always good to come back to an old classic,
- Wide range of Civs to play and game mode options
- Only real down side to this game is that the mutiplayer is extremly laggy even with a good pc, fps ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it's self when you do a 8, May not help that i like the pop at 500 but what can you do :')"
4114,"I like this game. My complaint is that the campaign with your choices of troops, and you have to complete the challenges is WAY, WAY too damn hard. The bots in the game are always so perfectly accurate 99 percent of the time they kill you with a headshot. If you are lucky, bots will hit you a little lower than your head, giving you barely enough health to stay alive. I like the game overall, but my problem is really just the bots and their difficulty. 6/10"
4115,"awesome game to paly. easy controls not violent for children and good graphics ,always love to play with friends ,easy to play . Nice game"
4116,"The sequel to Counter-Strike has challenges and a great online player base. This game is still played in many areas of the world, so no less problems about ping. And one of the most important things for an online shooter, friendly people. The people are really awesome! No swearing, just playing."
4117," A good game only took about 2 hours to beat and got all the challenges on my first try. On easy mode, I havent played the other difficulaties yet."
4118,"This is a classic! Played CS when I was 13, now I'm back at it at 26 and it's till just as great! truly doesn't get old."
4119,"i hate it
"
4120,"Counter Strike: Condition Zero 

This is basically old good 1.6 with better graphics and better bots. The bots are a great way to practice cs. There is also singleplayer tour of duty, that is basically counter strike missions against bots. Challenges include for example: kill 3 enemies with a sniper rifle. Great cs. If you liked any cs games, try this.

Grade: 10/10

"
4121,"My Old CS and was really fun when im in play 2005 or 2006 and i enjoyed that year for CS:CZ that Campaign mission was really good
"
4122,"Yes, its a well running game, with no lag."
4123,Basically CS with bots and organized objectives.  Good offline practice for CS.  8/10
4124,"Well... I mean, as an FPS it fails to deliver, and really only lives up to it's potential when you play it alongside the original game. At least then it feels like an honest, if not clumsy swing at a campaign mode. Deleted Scenes did  better, though not by much. 
5/10"
4125,"This is a great game, with a nice mix of missions and online play.  Graphics and game play are smooth on even low end machines, works great on both windos and linux"
4126,+
4127,it smells the quality of this old time <3
4128,"Great game, is better than people think it is. This game isn't underrated tho, it just doesn't get enough attention. 
I really think it's a cool game 

9.5/10"
4129,i love it
4130,Best Game Ever.
4131,"It's 1.6 with better graphics, more maps, and a single-player mode that actually is fun. To anyone new to counter strike and looking for buying advice: It's a fun game, of course. But don't be disappointed if you have a hard time finding people to play online with."
4132,"Its A Good Game......I like itüòò
Play Hard Go perOüòéüòé"
4133,"My summary in 4 sentences:
A game in the series that doesnt get much attention,unlike source for an example.Its the only in the franchise to have solo missions.There are very few players still playing tho,so you are basically buying 3 hours of missions against bots.The Deleted Scenes version has a story and a few more maps,if you can buy only that instead."
4134,I got this from the Valve pack and it's way too old and boring. Also the AI is very dumb.
4135,It is retextured cs 1.6 with missions.
4136,"If you are looking for a great Single Player Counter Strike, CS:CZ is not your stuff because its basically put you & some bot allies vs some bots in a normal match.

2/10 Its just CS with bots

CS:CZ Deleted Scenes in other hand is your stuff, its a set of Half Life like level with CS laws applied and the difficulty only alter the bot's accuracy and reaction time so no AK-47 headshot not instakilling.

8/10 Would kills Army of Japanese Guerilla to save anime thot CS style."
4137,Great game 10/10
4138,"Its good if your an oldschool fan of counterstrike 1,6. Its has some visual updates from the original one and some others features  as well. I like it!"
4139,"Un shooter cl√°sico, con la posibilidad de crear tu servidor para que entren tus amigos, tambien de crear mapas, e incluso algunos modifican las texturas del juego para hacerlo ver mejor.
Un cago de risa sin duda, si jugas con tus amigos, pero no te preocupes, and√° a un servidor publico y vas a ver como te divert√≠s tambi√©n.
9/10 - Podr√≠a entrar a un servidor unicamente a insultar de nuevo xD."
4140,I love this game. <3 #BEST x2
4141,"Pros:
+Better than Global Offensive
+Better hitboxes
+Lesser MM fags

Cons:
-Tactical Shields"
4142,"I think this game is worth a try
although I tried it for a while, but it's worth trying"
4143,One of the best game
4144,niceeeeee
4145,"What this game has over 1.6:

-Slightly better graphics
-Good bots
-Singleplayer

Go buy source you fucking morons"
4146,Old but gold ! I love this game:)
4147,Old and Obsolete
4148,"Very nice game,the bots are better than most csgo players"
4149,"The Tour of Duty mode is really fun and I am enjoying it. The extra detail on the guns, player models, and maps is nice as well.

If you have always just wanted to play Counter Strike 1.6 with bots this really is a no brainer. I waited 13 years to do it, but I paid $1 CAD for this game. It is CS 1.6 with bots and it is actually pretty awesome."
4150,Este un joc bun nu se comparƒÉ cu CS GO dar merge
4151,Throw the bomb off that skyscraper map and there goes the whole t side bots falling to their deaths.
4152,Counter-Strike: Modern Warfare
4153,Childhood games!
4154,awesome game very fun to play 10/10
4155,I love this game
4156,"I played this for full 40 mins and i can happily say that this gaem is veri gut and graifks are much better then the original and its also fun to play with friends (if you have any).And there are missions to play if you are bored so yeah! Have fun nebz (btw you also get deleted scenes for free so its like 3 games in (and you get cs 1.6) and get it fast till its still 99 cents boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii). 
TONY BAMANABONI OUT!"
4157,"Very good game if you dont have friends!!!
Also graphics are better than cs 1.6.
very nice game"
4158,"Okay, so if you buy this game you get 3 games: CS 1.6 CS:CZ and CS:CZ Deleted scenes. I don't think CS:CZ is good, but i think 1.6 is overall a better game, because it has far more players, and maybe 1.6 doesn't look as good as CZ, but CZ still looks pretty bad. CS:CZ Deleted scenes is worth it in my opinion, because it's Counter Strike campaign, where you travel across the world. There are 12 missions in Deleted scenes, but in normal CZ there are missions that are BORING and easy. Overall, i recommend to buy this game for Deleted scenes and 1.6. I don't recommend playing the normal CZ, because the missions are boring, multiplayer doesn't have alot people playing it, and 1.6 just feels better in my opinion. I do NOT hate CZ, i just don't like it."
4159,"Still Better Than CSGO

Less smurfs and more bugs

9/11 recommended for sure"
4160,How to pro step 1
4161,"Loved the game back in the days when i played it nonsteam
I played well over 500 hrs mostly offline missions with hard or expert bots
Now, this game just doesnt feel like a game that i could play for even 30 minutes straight!
Filled with nosteamers and mostly aim-hackers -_-
Awp and ak are trash in this game (especially for online play even with 30 ping)
Would recommend buying m4 and deagle , since most of the servers give u $16000 even if u join late or playing the first round...
I would say you'd rather go for Source or Global Offensive for a better Counter-Strike experience :)"
4162,One of my fav games
4163,Time ... i was 6 when i first played this game feeling old dude
4164,"Got the game for 50c. Probably old af. But, 50c... seriously."
4165,"For one of the most infamous CS games of all time, I still have lots of fun playing it and definitely would recommend it to anyone wanting to try a classic Counter-Strike game."
4166,This game is so unerrated on youtube. Tour of duty is really fun. If you want to play CS and take a break from competitive CS:GO and/or 16v16 madness this is a game for you.
4167,"I find it ironic how a dated game with more-so-than-not pixelated graphics running on an old engine can have more AND better content than both its prequels and other games within the same genre. When's the next time you're going to use a riot shield, or build your own mini-setups in game, or be able to play independent missions that don't require a plot or explanation because they do that for themselves? Yeah, thought so."
4168,CSGO is better
4169,Very nice.
4170,Best !
4171,Nice Job
4172,"CSCZ Deleted Scenes is pretty good, very linear but it has nice gunplay and a large variety in level-setting.

Normal CSCZ is your standard counter-strike, plant bombs, defuse them, save hostages and shoot bad guys.
Just what we all know and love. 
"
4173,Nice
4174,gg
4175,There is some fun missions really old but fun :)
4176,One of the Best FPS game...
4177,"pros: 
no lag 
no toxic kids in multiplayer
singleplayer missions
the people in multiplayer are kind and friendly
graphics are a bit bad but it's still a really good game
CLASSIC

cons: 
singleplayer bots never listen to you
Commander: Hold this position.
Cole: Negative
Sam: Negative 
Kenny: Negative
3 teammates are now dead you are on your own.


"
4178,"Not good as 1.6 imo, But its not bad neither."
4179,The classic !!!!
4180,"-> CS 1.6 with better weapon models, textures and bot support. If you can't find a server for 1.6 and still want to play the 
    game, this is the best way to do it.

-> Still better than current COD Titles

-> Back in time when I didn't have the internet, bots were my friends. ( * _* )

-> The only GAME I knewed & Played apart from GTA series @ My Childhood 
  
-> Posting PC specs would be stupid as CS CZ works ALMOST ON ANY PC !!"
4181,Good game for 1$.
4182,Good game
4183,Love this game
4184,"Lets start by saying that by buying CZ you get three games. Multiplayer Condition Zero & CS 1.6(If you don't have it already) and singleplayer CZ Deleted Scenes. As far as I'm concerned, for multi, it's better to play CS 1.6. Condition Zero doesn't even look that good with ""better"" skins and textures. More people play CS 1.6 so it's easier to find servers too. Also, i think that overall, 1.6 is a better game. Now... it's worth very much to buy this for Deleted Scenes. Everyone who ever thought to themselves how cool it would be if CS had a singlep. campaign... you will wonder no more. You fly around the entire world, there is a mission on almost every continent. It's hard, but good, plenty of meds and ammo lie around so even on the hardest difficulty surviving shouldn't be a problem, rather a challenge sometimes. There are around 18 missions and all of them are good/great. To be honest I expected much less from Deleted Scenes and I was pleasantly surprised. I would recommend it to anyone who still enjoys GoldSrc games. Just remember to switch off that damn vertical synchronisation before you'll start playing. It's on by default, made me move like an elephant with all that input lag ;) 

PS: If you decide to play on hard from the start, just remember to play it like regular CS. Don't rush, pick around the corners and obstacles alot and quick, reload only when safe, always aim heads, shoot mainly bursts or single shots, try not to get shot and this will be a walk in the park. Park full of terrorists that is. Also, after you'll finish all of the main missions, there will still remain few undone on the world map, bonus ones, be sure to finish them too, they are  interesting and a little different than the rest. Like ""Run!"" mission or ""Miami Heat""."
4185,Counter Strike story mode ?! Oh yes picked it up for 99 cent with cs 1.6 a deal if you ask me its fun to play if you have nothing else to play 10/10
4186,DDAAMMNN!!!!!!
4187,"Ok, ready for pewpew? Such plan, much execute. If you think this games not sick af then just try it m8 u'll cry tears of gratitude. You're welcome."
4188,Good game
4189,fine.
4190,"nostalgia...
play it if you like oldschool games"
4191,old and boring
4192,"brings me back to the good old days with my dell laptop in 2005... nostalgia-inducing game. reccomend 9/11, IGN"
4193,Nice game
4194,Old . . But Good :)
4195,"Trying to defuse a nuclear bomb when there's a guy with over 500 HP and a ton of armor armed with an Ak-47 on the hidden max difficulty is one thing, but then Turtle Rock had the nerve to follow it up with an AWPer.

I ship it 11/10"
4196,"Pasha Neo Kuben Taz Loord

Do you know?"
4197,"Back in time when I didn't have the internet, bots were my friends."
4198,Its the best of cs I have ever played!!! Love it!!
4199,I definetely recommend this product because the bots is much better than silvers in csgo period.
4200,bad game.
4201,"CS:CZ is simple, singleplayer Counter Strike fun. Although it's getting on 14 years old, I had a nice time playing this game. The bots are much more interactive and friendly than any bot in CS:GO, and the amount of maps included because CS 1.6 just adds to the diversity of the gameplay. There are also ""challenges"" in each mission, which are more like side objectives, making sure that you are never just running around aimlessly trying to win. You can also hand-pick which pots to get to suit your playstyle, like bots that aren't brave but are good at following directions. Each bot also mains a weapon, so if you need a sniper per se, you can pick one that suits your needs. Overall, this game is fantastic if you want to play singleplayer CS because CS:GO offline can go fuck itself. Definitely worth the $1 that I paid, and worth the $10 normal price."
4202,1st Love <3
4203,Ehhh...
4204,goods
4205,"Best game recommend by me go for it .
It's price varies from 36-370.so a hand on it is must."

4247,"Counter-Strike with fun single player.
 It's a classic. Probably evaluated thousands of times. This is essentially the original Counter-Strike with a single player campaing and AI that will help you beat AI enemies.
 Buy this if you want to play Counter-Strike offline and can't run CS:GO. This works well with low-end laptops. Buy it in a bundle/on sale if you don't have a lot of money. I play this occasionally on my laptop. Got it in the Counter-Strike bundle. I'd say a good experience for a game of this age.
 I'll keep it short and rap it up here. [b]Fire in the hole![/b]"
4248,love it it has great bots

4250,"This version of counterstrike is a dogma for me. The developers made a new-graphic game keeping the same engine (golen source) of 1.6 version.
I still like this game for its singleplayer story, a bit hilarious but funny. Worth product."

4252,Great game.  Old time classic

4262,The names of players bots cpu players the name of guns u buy in shop r not at all visible
4263,"CS 1.6 with better weapon models, textures and bot support. If you can't find a server for 1.6 and still want to play the game, this is the best way to do it. The Tour of Duty mode adds challenges and requirements for completion which add a genuine level of replayability and depth to the same maps we've all played a hundred times already.

Deleted Scenes however, is a horrible compilation of boring, derivative missions that removes all of the mechanics and weapon ballistics that made the multiplayer mode so unique. Utterly forgettable and not worth playing.

4268,I thought this was a really good concept for Counter Strike back in the day...a single player camaign with CS.... dam what a great idea!! this game is real fun...of course its not the CS weve been playing for ever online! but the story is pretty awesome...its pretty much what you would of expected with a single player CS game...it halso has special gadgets that aent in the multiplayer version to get through missions with....also every mission takes place in different countries and the same weaponry that exists in the games are there. its a great take on the CS experience in a campaign mode....i had alot of fun playing this.
4269,Muy bien

4275,ok
4276,This game was nostalgic and fun as hell. Absolutely love old games like this one.
4277,GOOD
4278,"Surprisingly fun single-player missions. Part of the fun in this game is just dealing with your incompetent bot teammates who don't always behave... properly. Aside from the main campaign provided with the game, there are plenty of third-party mission packs out there that you can install, and many of those are fantastic as well. I got a remarkable amount of enjoyment out of this game, despite its age.

Also, Turtle Rock rules! (Particularly Mike Booth. He's the guy responsible for most of the programming behind Valve's bot systems used in CS:CZ/CS:S/CS:GO as well as L4D/L4D2/TF2. That guy is awesome.)"

4306,Classic.  First I've played it in many years.  Still has a certain charm to it.
4307,It's ok. It needs to have better gameplay. Make a new game.

4309,it's good
4310,"i really like this game its enjoyable and somewhat challenging.
Counter Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes is just as good too :)
i would go as far to say Deleted Scenes is beter than the core game.
8/10

so i died, and then somehow i got into black mesa
yeah, im uploading some screenshots of it soon, i dont even have HL installed :D
still dont know how this happend
dont belive me? http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1195760625"
4311,Better that COD
4312,This game is very useful for testing the maps you make for Counter-Strike as it supports bots - you can check features related to 'various players in the map/spot/volume/etc.' with them when Online playtesting isn't an option.
4313,"Gaben, where HL3?"
4314,best!
4315,So.. I have to say this game is still playable. It's the same as 1.6 (I think) but with slightly different graphics. I play the deleted scenes more because it's more like a campaign. But this game is still sooo good. It has deleted scenes as I mentioned (campaign) and also something like a campaign but not in the deleted scenes version. I recommend you play this game and it's still fun in early 2k17.
4316,very fun game
4317,loved it!
4318,"Never before has a multiplayer game blended all the elements of true competition and sweat-soaked-shirt anxiety as well a Counter-Strike (CS). You probably already know CS as one of the most popular modifications for Half-Life. It's been available for download for over a year, at least in beta form. But unless you've got a super fast Internet connection at your house, you may not have played it yet as the nearly 100 megabyte download may be daunting for those of you not fortunate enough to have a high-speed connection. Thankfully CS has turned into a full-blown retail game and, while the two versions of CS are identical, it certainly worth shelling out $30 for this stellar title...plus you get a few more multiplayer goodies in the retail package to boot.

Let me start off by saying that the Counter-Strike pack is a stand-alone product. You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is Counter-Strike.

There is a single-player component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. As a terrorist, you're goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counter-terrorist, it's your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.

CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.

It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this ""Conga Line"" style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.

Visually the game will not disappoint. While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if you've purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.

As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your heart's content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, you're off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the ""wait and watch"" feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you don't just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldn't have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again."

4327,Was the greatest game of all time for me. But doesn't like to seem the iMac 5K. Very glitchy and absolutely unplayable.
4328,"Fun campaign. Even though there is really not a story to it, every mission tells a different story with fun gameplay! I really enjoy this game. I'm not a big fan of the multiplayer in my opinion, but it's there. I reccomend buying this game. This is so far my second favourite counter-strike game right behind source! 8/10

(for Deleted Scenes) Good game so far, a nice half-life style take on a CS campaign (better than the regular game, or I suck at CS in general...), however I did encounter problems with Building Recon: a staggering 4 headshots with the Scout in order to kill the leader. That's more than I can do at medium range behind cover and with a nuke beeping away. Tip: cheat code 'notarget'.

After completing the campaign, it is pretty hard but at least is a bit better than CS:CZ's one since I suck at Counter-Strike. As much as I suck, maybe it would be wise to list a few quirks in order to play this game: [spoiler]Use knife to get through vents, branches (Downed Pilot). On Hankagai, use the blue (crates? boxes?) in order to get over fences or to the vent.[/spoiler] When you discover everything you need to know about the game, it can be quite playable but there is still the problem of lack of armour most of the time (therefore a reliance on medical supplies) and that the enemies appear to be quite accurate, which only exarceberates the previous problem. Then again, I suck at Counter-Strike so what would you expect?

4335,Knowing that this game was made in 2004 i don't really play this but when im bored i play it a little bit.There is nothing bad to say about this game.

Its also nice cause on the original if you try to do online MP you get rekt by people who have been binge playing it for like 20 years, but this one wasn't as popular so most people will be of average skill (or lower).

Who would of guess that valve corporation will become that unethical micro-gambling piece of wasted human potential? Sure, money is good but video games always have been something more. It is a form of modern art.

At this stage valve corporation doesn't think that video games is a form of art but rather a form of business.

Art can't exist without sacrifice. And current valve employees are unwilling to sacrifice this cash cow in the name of art. 

Valve employees - don't you have enough millions stacked at this point?

It gives you at least a basic understanding of how to control recoil and standing still when shooting, for example. You can use what you've learned in the game and carry some of that over to CSGO. Try to finish as much of the Tours of Duty as you can; you can do multiplayer if you want to."

4446,"Condition Zero: 

The bots are actually difficult sometimes, but they can be pretty dumb sometimes. Don't bother going on multiplayer, it's either competitive matches between people who had this game since release in 2004, or dumb modded servers with custom maps that are also dumb. The single-player objectives hinder progress since it limits you to certain weapons and strategies, but it's really just a good training exercise for the custom games with bots. Lots of replay-ability. However, one map is much more significant than the rest: dust.

Deleted Scenes:

Now with objectives and a linear play-style, the game feels like you're going around the world stopping terrorists. The stories are a bit far-fetched sometimes, but it's still very fun. The voice acting isn't good (especially with the foreign accents), but it has some needed comic relief. You do some crazy stuff, too: stopping an ICBM from being launched, rescue hostages at an embassy, and kill some crazy crime boss Scarface-style. It's fun overall, and why not give it a try?"

Condition Zero is a series of missions that don't really correlate or connect with each other, but Deleted Scenes is a full blown story mode! Given the time that this came out, the story is very reminiscent of the early Call of Duty games. (and that's not a bad thing!)

8/10"
4477,The first Counter Strike game I ever played and the only one (I think) that has a campaign. Good memories. 10/10.
4478,"Thanks for the memories, Steam."
4479,"It's still a great games after all these years. 
Too bad not so many players now. :-("
4480,NICE
4481,Best game something new something  goood
4482,Bought it cause i wanted to kill some bots and play with friends. Im-fcking-possible to connect to and play with your friends even on steam. What the actual fuck? Why havent steam made this work better!? Not worth a single penny when you can't play the game with the people you want to play it with.
4483,"This is classic, sooooooooooooooooo difficult. I wonder how old player can mastered a game like this lol"
4484,Interesting game
4485,The game brings me old memories
4486,"This game is rubbish, it's poorly made, alot of things don't make sense"
4487,"Truly a masterpeice. Game begins with you and your other teammates helping you out as you defend of the hordes of incoming terrorists, as you go on you start to fight greater threats (ex. Ender Dragon, Jovan, Etc.) and the game gets better from there. The very last boss just is very unique and will probably never be recreated in any other game. I give this game a 10/10"

4505,"The black sheep of the CS family. It's kind of like a HD 1.6 but with adjusted sprays.
Comes with a old style CoD campaign so the bundle is pretty much value."
4506,I like this game
4507,Literally a cross between Counter Strike 1.6 and Source. Still a good game.
4508,Top Game
4509,just a second version of legendary CS1.6
4510,"Still the best FPS game for me.

Now I play this game using spectator only. Just to watch how the computer play along."
4511,"love it when I run out of bullets on a mission and I have to knife only, really fucking fun."
4512,"This brings back a lot of memories, i've been playing Counter-Strike since Beta 5.2 or so, when there were vehicles and the Aldi maps with the objective to blow up a freezer full of Pizzas and Condition Zero is the closest thing to the madness since 1.6 is more ""advanced"" than this, Source and Global Offensive go in entire different directions, the madness of original CS (once called realistic!) is here to stay with this fine piece of wacky gunplay, wacky gameplay, wacky developer history that is also shown with the deleted scenes, an entire different piece of Counter-Strike: Missions that barely work, with weird AI and no wonder it was cancelled (i feel old by saying that i lived through the entire sad story of this as it was portrayed in gaming magazines) 
Anyway this is really old school Counter-Strike with some weird hit boxes and a single player experience, in the main game you have to do objectives like ""kill 2 enemies with a sniper"" or ""defuse a bomb"" ot get points with which you can get some better bots, altough better sure is in the eye of the beholder, they talk to you a lot but they sure can't kick ass
As a bonus the deleted scenes are included a try to get a coherent single player story into counter-strike that was cancelled by Valve before it was even in a proper beta stage, it's actually better than you might expect but not great because of its age.
This pack is only for those who have a big nostalgia feel toward the good old days of CS or those who are curious at to what a single player CS looks like. For a low price and it's usually on sale anyway, it's worth to try, so i give a thumbs up, since even the regular price is low and on sale it's cheap enough so even a McDonald's employee can afford it."
4513,"Maybe someone who likes solo play games i would reccomend this.
I personally liked it, because it remembers when i passed hours in front of the laptop playing 1.6 with bots, and also the missions sometimes are complicated, also good for training yout accuracy skills.
"
4514,The ugly sibling
4515,"better than counter-strike : global offensive's operations and co-op missions

bring back turtlerock pls :c"
4516,Nice expansion for the original Counter-Strike. I picked this up on a Steam sale for like 1 dollar so it was worth it
4517,"Fun idea of game but weapons are terrible.
I don't know what happened to them but m4 as example is just disgusting in this game compared to CSS/CSGO/CS1.6."

  best campaign in this game"
4545,"Really fun to play. The missions are well made and require brains to finish. One of the most fun mission-based games I have ever played. Similar to COD.
The bad thing about this is that there is nothing linking the individual stories of the missions together.

Highly recommended."
4546,"i love this fucking game man. 
this was one of my first games on steam. the first one i played.
this, day of defeat, and team fortress 2 were the best games of my life.
late 2000's... love it ;)"
4547,"Deleted Scenes:
Let me just say this right now, this is not a good game. The AI sucks, even compared to games like Half-Life 1, the story sucks, and the whole thing just feels rushed and unfinished. But it's fun and it's ridiculous. Highly recommended."
4548,Like the original counter strike except they ran out of conditioner so no shiny sheen to the hair anymore 45 pantene out of 30 lauriel paris fraaaance

4574,"Only corrupted matchmaking in CS GO, all my matches was with way worse allies then enemies. Gameruiners / griefers in all my matches. Constantly team flashers, constantly team attackers.. The matchmaking is not automatic, corrupted swindlers from valve sabotaged 100% of my matchmaking. They choose all the griefers from a list & put them on my team. My allies is super useless & way worse then myself 100% of the times i spectated my team in CSGO matchmaking.
Only corrupted matchmaking with gameruiners/griefers in dota 2 aswell. Valve is some corrupted b.astards, i wont play valve games anymore, course valve is full of corrupted b.astards sabotaging 100% of my matchmaking."
4575," This game may be old, 
 But it's gold,"
4576,"Great Game. Just Like CS 1.6 but has a ""Story Mode"" which is pretty good. Not as many servers as CS 1.6 though. I still like to play this when I'm Offline because it has bots and medals that you can earn by beating the tours (campaign) on different difficulties."

Don't get irritated by my low playtime, the campagin records the playtime separately."
4582,"A classic game that runs in every system. The mission's are awesome, and the deleted scene stuff are also cool. Such an underrated game, it retains its tactical and classic game feeling of Counter Strike while adding its own twist to it. By the way, always choose Kenny, such a reliable bot/teammate. Anyway, this game is just another great Counter Strike game, highly underrated and extremely fun."

4584,"This game is arguably the best game in the series, with an amazing singleplayer mode and its fun gameplay. There's also something very charming about late 90s and early 2000s game graphics that makes the game enjoyable. In the singleplayer mode, you lead your own counter-terrorism team, which is great, even if you enjoy playing on the side of the terrorists. The teammates will have three attributes: Skill, Co-op, and Bravery. I don't know what these do, so you'll have to put up with my thoughts. Skill determines tactics, Co-op determines how likely they will respond to and obey commands, and Bravery determines if they camp or face the enemy head-on. I haven't played multiplayer yet, but if you suck at multiplayer (I know I do), then this game is for you. Even if you enjoy multiplayer, I still highly recommend this game and that you play it's singleplayer."

4648,"[h1]COUNTER-STRIKE: CONDITION ZERO[/h1]

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is more of a modification to 1.6 rather than a game in it of itself; it uses most of the same animations and only retextures a couple of maps, but it gets less credit than its due.

For instance, it has a far superior buy menu, with a more extensive loadout customizer that works way better than the one we have in Source.

The graphics are also way better and way more stylistic than Source's, which is literally 1.6 on the Source Engine, like a slightly less lazy HL:S. The sound design is greatly improved and the changed guns sound a lot more like an accurate depiction of what a real gun sounds like. Nothing even reminiscent of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds's but closer than any of the stock assets used in the other games. The model, lighting and texture quality was also made better, and both teams not only have a new faction each but also all have new stylized designs that stray farther from the real deal but still gives each of them a character of their own.

Not to mention that the controls are in this void between Source and 1.6 where it has recoil and less absurd penetration but the accuracy and shooting system in general is still 1.6's, which is very fun to play with.

Along with the usual simple offline bot match, this game has a few sets of 3 maps you have to clear by having at least 3 round wins and exactly 2 more than the terrorists, against a varying amount of opponents with different skillsets. It proves to be a good challenge to anyone and a great way to get good at the game while passing time and having fun. This mode also adds more depth to the CT factions, with each having a tendency to certain characteristics, for instance the Seals and the SAS are braver, while the GSG-9 and GIGN play it safe.

[h1]DELETED SCENES[/h1]

A very memorable experience, worth a replay or two. The large majority of the missions are fun, most of the enemies' deaths are animated with few exceptions, there's a lot of destroyable scenery and the battles are very ecstatic. The weapon, equipment and enemy progression is very well structured but the way the game tells how this worldwide conflict came to be or when is it all going to end is too loose to form anything concrete. My guess? Resonance Cascade. The game lasted 8 hours for me, but you can probably beat it in 6 on an easier difficulty.

There are a few references to Half Life, albeit probably unintentional, where loot is found inside those small green canisters Black Mesa employees use to store ammunition and weaponry, or in certain places where there are those ceiling turrets you see everywhere around the facility, even if a hell of a lot weaker.

A lot of the maps are very well detailed to the point of it not even looking like a GoldSrc game but rather an early Source engine game. Some of the textures leave a lot of room for improvement while some leave barely any. It uses a lot of flashing lights and other lighting effects so I recommend playing through certain missions like DrugLab or the final skycraper mission in Software mode. Both look better in a some places and in some not, with similarly varying performance, so its mostly up to choice and hardware compatibility. It's an old game, and so there's a chance you'll encounter lag no matter how pricey your rig is.

The factions consist of most of the OG, the Elite Crew, the Arctic Avengers, the Guerilla Warfare, and a few other ones, such as a few generic Islamic grunts or gangsters. All of them give the impression of Middle Eastern crazies that think nukes = less oppression, though, so the only real difference between them is that some hold hostages and some hold bombs. Basically the same as the multiplayer game, just a lot more exciting and real. The 1337s appear wearing all black with blue jeans, though, unlike their usual green shirt and brown jeans. The heads are all the same for every faction, except all use a different texture. For example, the factions that use the Guerilla Warfare model have different beard types, and the others rarely share the same body.

There's a lot more cinephys in this game than any other game from the same era. If it hadn't been so overlooked we might've gotten that juicy BF4 levolution a lot sooner than we asked. For example, certain characters that you kill fall out from whatever platform they're standing on and onto crates which break apart in a realistic manner without using any sort of simulation or gib effect. Another example is on the mission ""Building Recon"", when air support flies over a terrorist, blowing him out of the roof he's on and collapsing both his building and the one beside it.

Level exploration isn't a cryptic must such as in Poke646, where it's harder to find the way out of wherever you're in than to find a hidden cache, or the original HL, where there was barely any encouragement to exploration apart from Office Complex. You're rewarded with OP guns such as the AWP or the M249, which is as useful as it was in 1.6 instead of the crappy crap crap we got in Source and especially GO.

The player isn't talked much about and isn't voiced by anyone, but he seems to be always shifting, never a single person, as if you were really just a random soldier fighting through the waves of less trained opponents that happened to do a thing that saved a bunch of people, or in some cases just 2 or 3. And yet the game makes you feel proud of what you've done. I admire that. It's a very interesting take on the whole badass soldier vibe that most games nowadays and back then had. You'll probably remember that same mechanic from DICE's latest Battlefield game's campaign, just more pronounced and not ignored.

What happened to this game was unfortunate. Very unfortunate. It would've done just as much if not more than what HL did to the gaming industry if it hadn't launched so close to Source and had been properly advertised.

I fully advise you to buy this game if you're looking for a challenge that isn't too hard, but let me warn you, play it on easy. Playing through it on medium had me getting very frustrated in certain parts of the game for simply not being 1% faster than the AI. It's that hard. It's as if the HL1 grunts gained an eye on their back, sneaking is impossible in this game unless if you're told to, and grenades are rather unpredictable. Just make sure to keep in mind that grenades in this game are just like HL1's or 1.6's, even though they can deal a lot of damage if their ray casting doesn't catch their target its not gonna deal any damage at all, even if the target in question is behind a 1 unit thick wall or a on a slightly raised part of the scenery. Best case scenario, its right under their feet.

Wasting ammunition isn't an issue in this game. At all. I constantly find myself underwhelmed with ammo until I get something that deals some damage like a Kalashnikov or an M4 or even an AWP or a machine gun. Its like the game really wants you to use everything, but as always the M1014 is ignored due to its shittyness. Oh and don't even bother with the M3 Super 90, they nerfed it so hard its as useful as it is in CS:S and nowhere as cool and neat and super as 1.6's. Everything else is fairly meh.

Some of the mission concepts get tiring after a while; chase the VIP, defuse the nuke, kill the VIP, protect the VIP team, go after the guy that tried to assassinate the VIP, kill him, rescue these people, rescue yourself, repeat. It's repetitive as fuck and some more variation like in the mission Secret War, which I believe is the second one, would've been nice. I had to take 3 breaks before finally completing the game despite my will to do it in one continuous run. The voice acting is ok for the most part but it gets laughable at some others ([spoiler]""We could always throw icicles at the intruders! HOHOHOHOHO""[/spoiler]).

A very well deserved buy and another great mark on TRS's, Ritual's & Gearbox's past."

4660,"Ok, here we go, to be honest I just play Conditional Zero when I don't have internet, because I prefer to play 1.6 than CZ, but their graphics are beautiful and his game mode, I also played the history mode and it's fantastic, nowadays it's a good game as well.
How about disappointment?, ok, I just found one, there are no many servers."

It is probably my favourite game in the Call of Duty franchise aside from LEGO Star Wars II: Anakin's Repentance. This game is very good if you want an experience similar to playing CS 1.6 with mentally deficient small children that have bad voice acting. My favourite part of this game was the mission ""Miami Heat"", in which you play as a gambler named Nick Jonas who is in search of his long lost lover, but ends up rescuing hostages instead. Or the mission ""Run!"", where a bunch of samurais chase you for your gemstone adorned amulet. Overall I would reccomend this game, if you enjoyed the competetive ""community"" of CS:GO, this game will feel like a big 'ol hugbox."

4687,"Despite what everybody says, the campain is the main selling point, if your computer is slow, no worries.  I do have to say that the mutiplayer is dead, and not worth your time, if you are looking for a classic Couter Strike, go with Source. (as in Counter-Strike: Source).  

The campain, is like Call of Duty: World at War's campain on Veteran, very fun, but some parts just make you want to rage quit, because of the save system, that will get you at next to none health, and save right next to a ""bad guy"".  The story isn't even there, you play as a cop, then another cop, but never the same cop, but in exchange you do feel badass, saving the world from terriost, or the Irish.  I say give it a go, if you are tierd of mutiplayer, and need a fun campain."
4688,"I liked it. it was fun, i wish i didn't refund :("
4689,Valve commissioned this game to steal your money. It's a cheap cash-in that has no gameplay value and if you purchase it you will never forgive yourself.
4690,"I grew up with this game, lovely game, fun missions, i will never stop playing this game."
4691,"The black sheep and middle child of the infamous Counter-Strike series, Condition Zero was the follow-up to the original eponyous game, and in a way, it was a sort of a forerunner to the modern warfare genre of shooters, when the heart of WWII-themed games beat strong.

The core gameplay, although prettied up with crisper graphics and a slew of inventive new maps, was exactly the same as before, but with bots in case playing with real users is just not your cup of tea. Alongside this was ""Deleted Scenes"", a Half-Life-like spin-off that had an interesting premise, but is unfortunately bogged down with levels lacking in replayability, poor AI, and atrocious foreign accents.

Overall, it's an oddball of a title, but it's a worthwhile investment to toy around with if the somewhat elitist attitude of the esports meta-crazed fanbase threatens to turn you away from the series as a whole, as the in-game bots are aim-botty yet forgiving and there's always the Deleted Scenes to take a break with, if you can just bear the corny dialogue of your enemy. Oh, and rushing B, there's always that."

4706,"You'd think this is a fun singleplayer offline version, but it's really not.  Bots on your team can't aim at all, and bots on the other team have superhuman accuracy.  On top of that, the game gives you stupid missions to accomplish such as using garbage weapons to score kills with like using a low tier smg on a long-distance map, or using a low-tier sniper rifle on a close quarters map.  

Maybe if they paid you to play this, it would be worth your time, but the idea of paying for it is laughable."

4733,"Bad counter game, trust me"
4734,the best game after csgo
4735,"This is what happens when you have 3 cooks in the kitchen and take too long to get a game out. Compared to Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike: Source, which both came out in the same year as this game (2004), Condition Zero offers practically nothing. The game was so bad during development that Valve even reverted its ""gold"" status and changed developers on the project 3 times. The result is that very few ideas feel consistent and connected. 

Single-Player experience? You just get a bunch of bot matches with arbitrary and unimaginative restrictions and goals to complete missions that are not connected in any way (there isn't even any pretend story). The nicest word I can use for the sense of progression is ""limited"". Also, when you finish the game, there's just... nothing. 

Multi-player experience? This game plays exactly like Counter-Strike 1.6, but partitions the players instead of just offering the campaign as an expansion (similar to Diablo II and Diablo II: LoD, which also came out around the same time). There are some exclusive maps, but I failed to see how any of them were an improvement to their CS 1.6 counterparts. Even if the maps were enough of an incentive, it was a pretty low effort endeavor for someone to copy-paste them into the CS 1.6 workshop. This means that you essentially had 2 versions of CS going on at one time, except one of them costed extra so people just stuck with 1.6 instead lol.

Graphics? They look like hot garbage compared to the other games from Valve that came out at the same time (Half-Life 2 and CS: Source). The game looks like it was made in 1998.

I got this as part of the Counter-Strike complete package during a Steam Sale, and it felt like an incredible chore to finish. There is a video from a recent CS:GO major talking about the history of Counter-Strike, and they mention how ""[url=https://youtu.be/tUtNDLo9chQ?t=4m6s]Source is almost forgotten in CS history[/url]"". Funny how they comment on that while actually omitting CS:CZ from CS history. Honestly, this game is an embarassment."

4739,"Who cares about Condition Zero when you got 1.6
Gameplay wise it's the same as 1.6
The game I do care about is the one that comes with Condition Zero, Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes
It kinda feels like a battlefield game, you're someone doing some stuff and then you need to kill some bad people who are attacking you.
I would really appreciate a CS:S remake since it came out pretty much when CS:S did.
If you want an interesting CS 1.6 experience but you have no friends, play this."

Singleplayer 9/10  Hire a teammate you like,  
check his skill, his accuracy. As you go throught the levels your teammates will improve just like the ""Hire List""

Awesome Game, Recommending it! 10/10"
4770,"When you get Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, you are actually buying two separate games, Condition Zero, which is the final product and is essentially a bunch of bots matches, and the Deleted Scenes, which is a series of unconnected singleplayer level and is essentially the remains of an older version of the game before it was completely redone. The irony is that the final product seems to have less content and not be of as high quality as the Deleted Scenes.

Condition Zero itself is simply an ordered series of bot matches across many counter-strike maps. You can recruit bots using points won by winning matches which is pretty nice as it allows you to have some level of control over team management.

Within each match you have individual goals you must complete like 'kill a certain numbers of enemies with a particular weapon' or 'rescue a certain number of hostages'. These are presumably to try and force the player to vary their gameplay, but most of them end up just being frustrating and annoying to complete. 

Another frustrating feature is that if you die, there's no 'control bot' option like in CS:GO, you are instead forced to watch the bots play out the rest of the round. As I'm sure you can imagine, watching this can be very painful indeed, and it is also very frustrating and time-consuming. 

There is also a multiplayer component to Condition Zero, which is simply the same as in the original CS. There are surprisingly a significant number of populated servers, and it is very easy to simply jump onto a server and start playing. However if the multiplayer is the main component you‚Äôre after, it would be wiser to look into .6 as its playerbase is a lot, lot bigger.

Despite its flaws, Condition Zero is overall still a pretty fun game though.


Deleted Scenes however is a very different game entirely. It is a group of many call of duty style singleplayer missions. Although they are in the style of newer games call of duty, they still retain all the elements of classic counter-strike games, such as hitscan weapons with no aiming down sights and a fixed health percentage with no regeneration, as well as that classic GoldSrc ‚Äòfeel‚Äô. This in my opinion means that the game has a really interesting and unique feel to it.

The missions can be played in a pre-set order, however they aren't related in terms of context or story at all, each is its own separate unrelated 'episode' if you like. This might sound like a flaw to the game, but personally I believe it is a benefit as it means that each level can go in a different direction and is unique from the others. 

The gameplay mostly consists of call of duty style missions. Although the main overall gameplay is the same in all missions, the individual nature of each mission means that are all varied in terms of settings, plots and structure. For example, some missions contain lots of stealth sections, some require you to use various tools and gadgets like snake cameras, radios and explosives to progress whereas others contain boss fights against enemy leaders or vehicles. 

The levels are all of a perfect length too. You can easily complete a mission in one sitting, yet it'll still take you a reasonable amount of time to do so, allowing them to have a structure. 

In conclusion, if you're looking for the classic counter-strike multiplayer experience or the opportunity to play bot matches, while Condition Zero will allow you to do those, it would be wiser to look towards 1.6 or GO respectively. However if you are a fan of games like Call of Duty, Half-Life or just GoldSrc games in general, then Deleted Scenes is an underrated fun experience.

4771,play it faggots
4772,"Way, way, way back in the day on the original Xbox I played the version of CS they ported over. Condition Zero is the closest  thing to that version. 

A lot of good memories from back then. 

I really wish this game had been more successful, but it really didn't need to exist as its not a significant change from 1.6 graphically or gameplay wise."
4773,"Pretty good game, it's basically CS 1.6 with a campaign, single player with bots, and a few graphical improvements."
4774,this game make me sick
4775,"WHY AM I STILL PLAYING THIS GAME???

"
4776,Not a fan.  Doesn't offer a lot and not much different that the rest of the series.  Sticking with Battlefield series. 01/10
4777,"As a game that comes free with 1.6 it's good. But by itself the only thing it has over 1.6 is slightly better graphics, bots and a ""Campaign mode"" (Deleted scenes has an actual campaign mode)"
4778,"Solid counter strike single player action.  Not the best, but pretty darn good.  I would rather be playing Counter Strike multiplayer, but I remember this being a good alternative if internet was out.  Would recommend for nostalgia reasons only.  Have a great day!"
4779,CS Good Old days
4780,"Before screaming 12 year olds, before 30 dollar day one dlc, in the shrouded mists of my boyhood, there were actual good games. CS:CZ is one of them. My best friend and I used to play this game for HOURS just taking turns killing bots. 

It may be that I have my nostalgia blinders on, but I genuinely believe that this is the most fun Counter-Strike, precisely because it's the LEAST SERIOUS one. It's essentially CS 1.6, with updated graphics and some really fun bots thrown in. You can even edit the bots and make your own bot leagues if you are so inclined. Also, if you Google search ""Condition Zero botprofile"", there are people that have already edited botprofiles and uploaded them so you can download them. If you don't have time to edit your own bots, then these files will make the bots better without you having to do the footwork. 

In summary, if you are a person who wants to play some CS, but you don't have the time to invest in becoming a 1.6 tryhard, or if you are just an old school CS player, (like me) who won't buy into all this CSGO skin annoyance, or if you simply don't want to listen to 12 year olds tell you about how many times they've slept with your mom, then pick Condition Zero up. It's really great."
4781,"Fixed many of the bugs and glitches of CS1.6. Updated graphics, models, maps, guns and sounds. Grenade damage didn't hurt you through walls anymore, but packed more punch.
For me, Condition Zero was a better game than 1.6, which i why i played CZ more than 1.6. Just had more fun playing that game, instead of being wallbanged by a guy from the other side of the map on 1.6. A bit more realism, so it helped.

Yet, Valve rarely ever talks about the game. In a recent youtube video called; ""The history of CS:GO"", they only talk about 1.6 and Source, and act like CZ never existed... but for me it was a huge success. Better game than 1.6 in every way!"

You can create your own Tour of Duty campaigns with custom set ups and missions, and the ai learns custom maps pretty well. There's a lot to do here and if you are like me with no friends that want to play Counter Strike anymore and you want to play user made maps, this is a great game for you."
4792,nice.....
4793,"[h1]Overview[/h1]
Counter-Strike: Condition Zero or CS:CZ is a team based FPS where teamwork and strategy is everything. One wrong move, one stupid decision, one badly handled recoil and you're dead. This game, and like the other versions of it, is very challenging.


[h1]Pros[/h1]
-Fun and Addicting
-Teamwork
-Realistic
-Challenging recoil and aim
-Single-Player missions
-Mods
-Variety of game-modes
-Loadouts

[h1]Cons[/h1]
-A bit glitchy and laggy, but what do you expect from a game made in 2004?
-Not a game for scrubs. Get good.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I honestly love this game, and the other versions of it. I would recommend you try it out to atleast see what the old Steam was like and how things worked. But as far as the series goes, I have to recommend that you get into CS:GO rather than this.

4806,Good game
4807,"So, as it seems, CS:CZ is suppose to be a singleplayer game, along with traditional multiplayer mode almost identical to one found in the previous CS instalment, the infamous 1.6. 
As a player who actually likes playing against bots in online games, such as Counter-Strike (any), Team Fortress 2, FoF, Quake Live, Quake 3 and Quake 3: Team Arena, the whole ""singleplayer element"" found in CS:CZ is really, really bad in my humble opinion.
The gameplay is just like your traditional Counter-Strike but with predifined number of bots and ""tasks"" instead. The player is given several tasks which MUST be accomplished in order to pass the mission. Unfortunately, majority of these tasks are absolutely what the player SHOULDN'T be doing in a regular CS match. Here are some examples:
1. Kill x players
2. Kill x players with a specific gun
3. Kill x players with a specific gun and survive the round
4. Win below x seconds
5. Rescue x/all hostages

So, here's my explanation to the following points respectively:

1. Barely any progresss will be made if player's playstyle won't be shifted from cooperative towards tryhardish, with the former being much more welcome in online games. That means, in CS:CZ campaign the player must play aggressively, lone-wolfing, making him prone to dying. Of course, the player may remain cooperative but it will very likely result in a rather unwelcome prolonging of the mission.

2. In order to perform well, players should always use weapons they feel comfortable with/high tier weapons, however in this case the player MUST use a specific weapon (usually a fitting one for the map though). Sure, game forces us to try out different guns but in reality the players usually stick to Deagles, AWPs and M4/AK47 for the most of the time anyways. Perhaps that's the task, but still a crappy one, considering players have their most favorite and hated guns, which will never be chosen in an online game anyway.

3. Same as above but this time with an opportunity to actually fail the task, forcing the player to be stuck with whatever gun he/she has to stick with for even longer until he/she finally manages to score required amount of frags and also survive the round.

4. Another tryhard gameplay promotion. Frag opponents in shortest time possible, meaning, the player must rush B like a cyka blyat in order to pass the mission. At least it is somewhat challenging at times but again highly discouraged in traditional CS matches.

5. The absolute worst of all tasks, since AI controlled hostages can easily get stuck, yet the task will be only ticked off when all of the hostages are rescued. Here's a number of things that can easily prevent player from accomplishing this task:

a. Hostage gets stuck and it is no longer reachable (like jumping from a balcony/roof but the hostage doesn't follow). Even if reachable, it's extremely tedious to go back and it also increases chances of encountering an opponent, which can make player's ordeal completely null and void.
b. Player manages to get to the hostages, takes them with him/her but bots suddenly frag the very last terro, triggering the win-by-elimination victory.
c. hostages get in the way during gunfight, potentially making player stuck, giving terro an opportunity to score a frag and obviously preventing player from finishing this task in this very round. The loss might have an impact on the next round, reducing the chance of accomplishing the task even further.

Summary:
CS:CZ is a lazy attempt at CS singleplayer mode, full of solutions that are plain wrong and boring. Better stick to a regular game with bots and play as you wish. It could have been much better if it would have taken Half-Life's approach. Instead we have a game. barely different from any of the other CS games but instead with bots and boring, forced tasks. Tedious. That's all that can be said about the campaign. As a singleplayer game I do not recommend it. As a multiplayer game, you better off stick to CS 1.6 instead."
4808,nice game
4809,Ah! The famous Counter-Strike! Who couldn't love this game?! While yes it's made me rage many times it's a game that's branded it's self into my mind and also just Steam's history. I've found great entertainmnet in it and it holds a speical place in my heart. This game is nothing but art.

4830,"I have been playing Counter-Strike since the betas many years ago. Of all the games I have played this is one of only a few multiplayer FPS I go back to.  The modding within Counter-Strike and its successors make it any experience you would like. There are RPG, DM, GG, etc servers to mix things up if you don't just want to play the standard game.

Nearly 20 years later I still enjoy it."
4831,The game is old but its awesome
4832,i love this red alert game from when i was child :*
4833,"Played this 24/7 before cs:go was a thing. Still dope until this day, tho you need friends to play w"

4837,A remastered CS1.6 with some different mechanics.
4838,"No matter how pro you are in Cs, you'll never be able to make a headshot in the deleted scenes game.

4840,10/10 nostalgia <3
4841,"This game is crimminaly underrated, and its aged AWFULLY. Despite being one of the best counter strike experences, now if your a competive player, you probably hate the game you think its awful. but if your a casual like me, then you probably think the game is fantastic. However CSGO has shown signs of doing stuff similarly to this game, but this is pretty much the story game that CS didnt have, if you think that css, cs, or csgo is too fast paced, this game will be there for you, just know. this game has its fast moments"
4842,I really like this game except for the huge amount of hackers that screw it for the honest players.
4843,My life xD
4844,Good Game GG
4845,at least the bots arent hacking
4846,Amazing game! Definitely deserves a remaster.

4855,"[h1]It's a completely unnecessary remake of the original CS 1.6.[/h1]

The graphics are [b]marginally[/b] better, the gameplay is exactly the same, maybe some changes to weapons' stats or so but not really noticeable.

The ""campaign"" consists of playing ordinary Counterstrike matches with some specific goals like ""Kill 4 enemies with the Bullpup"" or ""Save all hostages"". You are accompanied by the most annoying and frustrating Bots in Video game history. The other team consists of Bots as well. Their skilllevel either [b]stupid as a rock[/b] or [b]stupid as a rock with lightning fast reflexes and godlike accuracy.[/b]
It's not suited for training for online multiplayer since no human being behaves like that.

4857,worst game ever
4858,Better than csgo
4859,Best Game ever!!!!
4860,"Pros: Has riot shields.

Cons: Later iterations didn't get riot shields."
4861,"a really good game in my opinion. The mission is really fun and also intresting, but when theres a mission that requires you to make a bot follows you, in this case the bot is kinda stupid, when were to fast to walk the bot doesnt follows you that makes you have to go back where the bot is left on and make him follows you again. Also whenever i play this game for no reason i always got headache maybe because the pace of the game?"

4875,"This game is more fun with the bots. Granted, the AI is sometimes terrible and glitchy for many maps (even cz ones), but the most fun is to edit the botprofile.db and make your own unique bots (it's very easy to do) and essentially form your own match league. I have created around 700 bots each with their own clan tag, track standings/stats etc. Granted, it's a lot of bot-simulated matches which would be boring to most people, but has kept me occupied as I am a stat junkie. Captures some level of competion for me, as I am way too old to participate in any ladders or really be any good anymore, whereas most people could dominate any of the bots very easily. But for me, a fun little throwback to my younger days. Now I'll go put my false teeth back in and take a lap around the retirement center on my motorized cart."

4890,"[h1][b]This part is for The Deleted Scenes Part![/b][/h1]
This is what Half-life should of been. You play these mini missions and your goal changes on each mission. Sometimes you have to recurse a hostage or defuse a bomb, or stop a drug lord. Each mission gives you different weapons and tools to use. Also some of those weapons have a flashlight on them so use them in dark areas if you want. Each mission has its own small story to it and its own cast of characters. Also each mission takes place in different areas. You could be in the U.S for one then in Japan in another mission. I had more fun with this game then I did with HL1 .
[h1][b]This part is for stock CZ![/b][/h1]
Single player mode has you playing on maps with a set goal(s) in which you have have to complete to move on to the next one. Unlike Deleted Scenes which hands you the weapons, you have to buy the weapons yourself just like in a normal round of CS, also you can hire AI controlled npcs to help and each have their own pros and cons. Some listen to commands better while others don't, some are good with weapons and some are more braver then others. Other then that its normal CS and I had some fun. Your mileage may vary tho."

4902,Headshot
4903,Awesome game with old school graphics ..
4904,The legendary Counter Strike series and Call of Duty gave us a beautiful boy.It cames with the CS 1.6 so this game and it's story mode is another reason for you to buy Classic Cs over CS:GO.

8/10."
4907,"(Review for CS:CZ Deleted Scenes)
I actually have to say that this game entertained me, even though it is about 12 years old. It kinda reminded me of Half Life but with a more shooting based story. It is probably the most underrated Counter-Strike...

Metacritic:
65 / 100 Metascore
8.8 / 10 User Score"
4908,"for a counter strike story plus upgraded graphics 10+ hours story + multiplayer 
servers are dead"
4909,"Classic game. The thing I like best about this part of the franchise is the campaign; I wish that Valve would add something similar to CS:GO.

Try it if you enjoy campaign, or if you want CS without it actually being CS."

Better graphics"
4924,I like it.
4925,It's a nice a game when your internet isn't working.
4926,"Great Game, Great remake of The orignal counter strike but with single player slightly different from playing with bots and ok graphics and good modelling"
4927,the game does not start up it just stays at full blackscreen
4928,kaia
4929,Proper CS :)
4930,best fps game off all time
4931,Amazing game. I like it even more than 1.6.
4932,"I honestly think Condition Zero is better then the original CS. (Yes, sue me.)
PROS:
+Better graphics than the original
+Gameplay is fun
+A tad bit more challenging
CONS:
-Not as many people playing CZ over the original
-Valve doesn't update CZ anymore aside from maintenance updates
-Development hell makes the game feel rushed

If you liked the original CS I think you'll like CZ. Give it a try."
4933,"      Counter Strike Condition Zero is an odd one. Caught in between CS 1.6 and Source, it came very close to CS: Source's release, and was brushed aside. At the time, it graphics were outdated, and its single player content was lacking. Today, the single player content is just as lackluster. The regular campaign is literally offline bots with some slight customization. It's bland, boring, and the AI is pretty terrible. There's also the ""Deleted Scenes"", which is actually an entirely other game. It's a single player CS Campaign that plays nothing like Counter Strike. It feels more like a fast-paced Arcade shooter. It's plagued with poor map design, cheesey plot that desperately wanted to blend with games like Halo at the time, and gimmicky spy gadgets that while intriguing at first, are poorly executed. 
    Where Condition Zero does shine is its multiplayer. It's graphics are dated but timeless. It feels like an updated CS 1.6 in visuals, and plays in a way thats really unique to Condition Zero. Ammunition is expensive and money is tight, so you really have to watch your shots in this game. It still has a very large playerbase, and holds up much better than the classic 1.6 
   While Condition Zero failed to capture a single player Counter Strike expirience, it did create a pretty fun Multiplayer that's still fun to hop on today. It's by no means a masterpiece, but it isn't a bad game. If the CS Anthology pack ever goes on sale, I'd say pick it up and try it out. But on its own, I'd say it's a pass."
4934,By far the best Counter-Strike game out there.
4935,A game that counter strike fans want to forget but still has it's charm.
4936,It's and old school past time that has become yet again another obsession in my life.

7.5 / 10"

4943,Very Fun Game I enjoy the campaign and it is one of the earlier counter strike games and we play cs go a lot today.
4944,I'm reallly addicted to this game! I highly recommend buying it! Its worth it.
4945,Best Game for People who doesnt have any friends.
4946,"Forget about the Tour of Duty and the original Condition Zero. That game is a crap and a waste of time. The AI are so stupid and it takes hours to finish missions in the later part of the game.

Instead, play standalone Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes, which is brilliant and much better than the normal CS:CZ. I Assure you will like it after all this years and won't feel the age of this game. It's like Counter Strike 1.6, but with a plot, new weapons and features and improved graphic (which doesn't hurt the eyes anymore). I strongly recommend it!"

5019,"The follow up from the original Counter-Strike game, this was for me one of the first games that I really started to have fun, there are endless things to do, play a couple missions, join servers with weird mods, the old known predator mod in which you get hunted down by a predator and you'll have to kill it in the dark with a group of random people.
From surfing to bhopping, playing paintbal, you name it and CS:CZ has it."
5020,Wow is nice
5021,Best singleplayer Counter-Strike game made.
5022,fairly underrated even though its the worst of the pack. it tried to create a single player cs experience but failed. other than that it doesnt do anything wrong. still the same classic cs experience.

5038,"I mainly play this game just because of the Nostalgia trip. I got hundreds upon hundreds of hours on CS:CZ back on my old account when my internet was so bad that I could only go up against bots. If you ever boot up this game; which I hope you should at least once if you buy 1.6, expect very few players on almost all servers besides one or two for the reigon that fill up with a community. Since it's usually a community on a server, you can get to know them fairly well, and maybe even become friends with them. Playing this is a very unique experience, and that's why it's my favorite Counter-Strike game, and maybe even one of my favorite games overall."

5052,"Nutshell: 8/10 - Not the best of singleplayer campaigns but otherwise an amazing classic FPS game for a decent price. 

What is Counter-Strike: Condition Zero? - SWAT Team Simulator 2004 is the short answer, if you've played the original Counter-Strike, then this is basically the same thing, with a singleplayer campaign.

Will it Run on My Computer? - 10/10 - Probably, unless you got a really outdated computer (if your computer was made later than 2000 I'm sure you're fine, really it doesn't take much to run this game)

Parents Guide - I'd say it's 13+, you can turn off blood, and deaths in this game aren't very graphic when blood is off.

Graphics - 6/10 - I'd say, for being made in 2004, it's really lacking, only thing that noticeably improve over the original Counter Strike is better textures, otherwise graphically it's identical. 

Singleplayer - 6/10 - There is a singleplayer campaign, though it's really lacking, as with most first-person shooters, though it's better than not having a singleplayer campaign at all. 

Multiplayer - 9/10 - Pretty much perfect, though I will point out this game is 12 years old as of this review, so there are not as many players as say, 5 years ago. Player count aside multiplayer is awesome.

Is it Worth it? - 8/10 - Pretty good, not much more I could really ask for in an FPS that's only $10, mayber slightly better graphics, but really it's worth every penny."

5080,"If you want to be destroyed by people who've been playing the game since CS 1.1 release and are tryhard mlg pros that wallbang headshot you with dualies from across the map, you get 1.6.

If you want to play dress up dolls with your guns, get scammed out of your skins, and play with a bunch of blokes in a matchmaking system that sometimes works but mostly ques you into a game consisting of anyone ranging from people who just installed the game to Global Elite smurfs with Silver IV accounts with ridiculous updates that make a $700 pistol the most powerful gun in the game,you get Global Offensive.

If you want to play a ton of surf, bhop, prison, scoutsknivez, and many more minigames and never find any servers with the actual core game, you get Source.

If you want to have fun, play with a decent community, use guns that are mostly not broken, have a game that can run on nearly any computer, and actually play the core Counter-Strike game, you get Condition Zero."

Deleted Scenes is meh, but I mean it was scrapped and then added in just because.  It's kinda frustrating, but with more polish it might actually be somewhat decent.

I recommend this over CS 1.6 if you're trying to choose between this and 1.6.  This is basically CS 1.7."

5123,"The main issue people found with Condition Zero was that it looked a lot like 1.6; although that claim is true this having mild graphical enhancements and plenty of bug fixes, it's still a great game. The multiplayer is like 1.6 but the true fun is to be had in deleted scenes - which if you don't know is essentially a counter strike 1.6 campaign mode and although not revolutinary now-a-days it's still a whole lot of fun. If you push aside the graphics there is a lot of fun to be had on this game and for all the hate it got it's still good old counter strike. So if you have some time spare or your getting sick of Global Offensive give this a try ( I recommend going on hard mode for the most enjoyment).

TL;DR
This is an underated gem - completely worth your time."

5132,"You can read my Counter Strike review and see how I got here, but CZ came out when I got back into CS after my first steam account was hacked over 10 years ago.  So I get a new account and go to buy CS and notice there is a newer version with a single player and updated graphics at the time.  I grabbed it as CS was one of my favorite shooters at the time and was not disappointed (aside from the single player mode) one bit.  The game was generally the same aside from some updates that really made me feel like I wasn't still playing a game that was 5 years old.  This trend obviously continues with Source and now GO, showing me my opinion at the time has been carried on by many."

5179,"[h1]Combine CS 1.6 and COD and what do you get? Condition Zero. [/h1]

[b]Tour of Duty Mode[/b]
     In Condition Zero, Valve have improved the CS formula by adding a story and squad mechanics. In the Tour od Duty mode, you're presented with a paragraph or so explaning your mission before you play a few rounds of CS 1.6 on all your favorite maps. Though the Tour of Duty mode can get tiresome, it's kept somewhat fresh by managing your squad. Before each mission, you can choose which squad members to bring, and you can see your team grow from a rag-tag team to a crack squad.

[b]Deleted Scenes[/b]
     The real meat and potatoes of Condition Zero lies in the Deleted Scenes extra content. I can only assume that Deleted Scenes was an early version of Condition Zero, hence the name and rough edges. Deleted Scenes plays much more like a COD game than CS. Your character is a lone badass hero, who guns his way though rooms of enemies, until he finally completes his objective. Each mission has it's own maps. You won't be playing on de_dust2 here. Instead, you'll be infiltrating a secret warehouse where some terrorits have taken a stolen nuke, or stopping an ICBM from launching. Deleted Scenes is definetly a diffrent exprence from the typical CS game, but it's also a great one.

[spoiler]HOHOHOHOHOHO[/spoiler]"
5180,Good game :)
5181,"por que esse CS existe ? √© literalmente a mesma coisa do 1.6 com gr√°fico diferente e com um modo que parece os cen√°rios do rainbow six, credooo, s√≥ to dando an√°lise negativa porque a exist√™ncia desse CS n√£o faz sentido mas o jogo √© bom mesmo assim >:)"

But anyway its a beautiful game u all will luv it!!! <3"
5192,"This is a GREAT fun multiplayer game, but you need time to figure the map and the guns and the load outs ... 
I will have a little rant though, about a VIP player called ""Peabody"" ... this guy BANNED me for THREE days on the UGC server for having a little sing for no more than 10-15 seconds ... he didnt warn me ... he didnt say stop it .... ok on his defense it was britney spears BUT common MAN dont JUST ban people ... anyway when I went back on five days later I saw him and I called him out saying WHY did you ban me? you could have told me to shut up or MUTED me for an hour or BANNED me for 30 minutes ... I would have gotten the message i'm not a newby (well a little lol) i have been playing in this server for over 500hours .... anyway WITHOUT A NOTICE HE PERMANANTLY BANNED ME!! ... ok i did call him a D**K BUT he deserved it for what he did previously without a warning.
Anyway its over now and I can spend the time not enjoying this server and friends I play with on there including Alfantander, Retro, pointless, rocked, x.e.y.w.a.n.i. (yeah its spelt like that) and loads ot other guys i cannot remember their names on the server but all cool guys ... ANYWAY ... 
WATCH OUT for PEABODY!! and its in the UGC server de-dust2 .... apart from HIM! the game and ppl are cool."

5198,Awsumm ..
5199,"I dont know why people underrate this in front of cs 1.6.
Ok the missions suck granted. However we must take into 'account that this had bots.
This had better graphics and physics.
Sometimes when a new map is added to 1.6 it fails to be analysed.
I never experienced this here.
This game has fewer bugs and is therefore better than cs 1.6 for suure."

5201,Good
5202,Kinda sad that i can't do bhops. Still had a lot of fun
5203,"Game is not bad, actually in some situations is better then Counter Strike 1.6, but again, there are no players...
I think, the maker of game must share some keys.."
5204,"Better than CS:GO in every way, and runs on older equipment... it's from 2004 !!"
5205,"It has a funny single player campaign. I thought some of the parts were pretty epic, especially when you take down a jet with a sniper rifle."
5206,"Kinda the weird cousin to Counter Strike: Source.
But still great.

If you don't have any friends and don't know how to set up bots in Source, this is the Counter Strike game for you.
Of course, I know how to set up bots in Source, but I play this game simply for the fact that the Singleplayer is just kinda ""play one map, unlock the next"". And that's quite cool considering it's a singleplayer element to a natively-multiplayer series.

Plus it comes with Counter Strike 1.6 (I think it came with that, I see it in my library and remember getting it with Condition Zero) and some deleted scenes. So yeah. Try those both out too."

One niggle I have however is that the bots are pretty useless half the time, especially as the game pretty much depends on them entirely unless you're an expert player that can win 1v6 almost every round."

5245,"Counter Strike Condition Zero is an interesting game to discuss not because of it's merits as a game but largely for it's history. It had a surprisingly troubled development and changed hands between 4 distinctive developers before finally becoming finished. 

The game was originally designed by Rogue, the developers behind Strife and American McGee's Alice. However the developer went out of buisiness so Valve instead gave it to Gearbox, who Valve had previously worked with on Opposing Force and Blue Shift. Much of the game is based around Gearbox's version, which focused on creating more impressive graphics and remaking many of the classic Counter Strike maps in better detail.

However, the project changed hands again and the game was handed off to Ritual entertainment. The guys behind SiN. They remade the game as a pseudo singleplayer title before Valve decided to hand the game off to Turtlerock studios. Who would years later create Left 4 Dead. Who finished the game and completed it based on Gearbox's version. The content Ritual made would be released as the ""Deleted scenes"".

The final game is very much inspired by Counter Strike 1.6. It plays very similarly albiet with nicer graphics and a very different art style. It was also the very first Counter Strike game to ship with bots by default. The game also contains a singleplayer separate from the Deleted Scenes, however this is just an Unreal Tournament style ladder featuring botmatches. 

When Condition Zero came out, it was seen as outdated. It released two years too late, and the very same year as Valve's own Counter Strike Source. As a result it isn't often talked about when compared to the other games. Since you do get it by default when buying 1.6 it's interesting to play for curiosity's sake, but you'll likely find more players for 1.6 or Source."
5246,Good.
5247,"This game actually has better bots than the latest iteration of this game series, good graphics that is reminiscent of CS 1.6, a nice game which actually isn't affected by nerfs or buffs, which is nice, most modern computers should run this game, it's still very dark in certain parts of maps (a well known one being lower tunnels leading to B palace or CT mid on Dust 2), this does offer single player missions so if you want a game of CS without the graphics but with the nostalgia, CS:CZ is one of the games you should play. If you buy this game, you get CS:CZ, CS 1.6 and the ""Deleted Scenes"" version of this game, for the price of CS 1.6 alone, which is a nice bonus and one of the better reasons to buy this game if you want empty servers and bad graphics, but it's nice to relive CS 1.6 again."

But the single player campaign is dope

just in case you want to try classic games
Give this one a chance..

ps. I only played the Deleted scenes but it doesnt have a store page so I reviewed this one.
Its practically the same right?.. I think"

5271,One of the best FPS games I've ever played with friends. I really love the game as much as I love the rest of the Counter-Strike games. I definitely recommend buying this game along with the other Counter-Strike games. It brought me enjoyness of PC gaming! I give this a 10/10 :D

5276,"Counter-Strike:Condition Zero is the best game online because it is easy to use for all the computers since it don't need so many requirements as other games, this way many mas users are going to have an easy access to play this fabulous game in line. It is also one a revolution in this of the games online since the change of graph is very well-known between(among) the Condition Zero and the first Counter-Strike and its alone realism overcome by the Counter-Strike: Source. This game also can be played of a player by if you want to play the way history."

1.) You bought this? HAHAHAHA...you idiot!
2.) Oh wait...I bought it too....

0/10 Go drunk Counter-Strike, you are home!"
5282,What is there to say its CS. Buy it.
5283,Its like a single player of CS:GO where the graphics are potatoized. This is a very fun game and I highly recommend it.
5284,"I do not know why, but this is actually so fun! It is really entertaining and a good single player game."
5285,"Its like CS:GO but a wee bit older

5288,Less cheaters than csgo
5289,An interesting Counter-Stroke game.
5290,Such good old memories from this game :)
5291,No.
5292,Reminds me of my early childhood <3

This is just cs 1.6 but better graphics and realy better movement!
Plus it comes with cs 1.6 for free!!! You heard me right!
This is 100% reccomended without mentioning the fact
that it is realy fast at over 100 frames per second for a realy

5313,"Single player is quite fun, but can be boring. I like counter strike, and it was interesting to implement single player. As 1.6 will refuse to work on my computer, this is the most retro CS I have. The only thing I don't like so much is there is no dot in the centre of the crosshairs, making it hard to aim with non scoping weapons ( including bullpup)"

5317,lol
5318,Not bad.

5320,"The classic counter strike with slightly improved graphics, new content new maps and improved bots. The single player 'campaign' in it is basically playing all the usual maps and get certain number of kills in certain weapons and rescue certain number of hostages nothing fancy but It's just a very good classic.
I only recommend it if you're getting it through the valve bundle.

UPDATE:

The counter strike condition zero deleted scenes redirected me to the same store page as this so apparently it comes with it, the deleted scenes have a decent campaign consisting of different missions on the world map including all the counter strike characters, weapons and even new equipment and some stealthy action, it was a fun campaign, it is totally worth it."
5321,old but the best!!
5322,cs: cod edition is ok
5323,This game is so lovely! It's like cs:go operations but nicer. I give it a 10/10 . This grapichs were insane in 2004.
5324,Basically CS 1.6 with slightly better graphics and a shitty single player campaign.

5326,"I got this before u had to buy XD
"
5327,CS 1.6 Singleplayer.Reminds me Call of Duty Modern warfare!
5328,"Ah! An amazing classic! 

Earlier I had the non-steam version which I had gotten from my friend, but I formatted my computer without backing up, so I lost all my data, including the game. I decided to purchase the Steam version, after much thought between this and Source, since I've never played the latter. I also own CS: GO, but I've always preferred older games, simply because my computer isn't graphics heavy, and newer games tend to lag quite a bit, which is the last thing you want in FPS games.

I'm playing this after a long time, and I must say, this is much better than Global Offensive in so many ways, I regret purchasing it. If you are in doubt of which to buy, go for CZ. I definitely recommend it over GO. I'm yet to play Source, and I will write another review once I do.

The missions are decent -- they don't add much to gameplay, but each mission gives you a sense of satisfaction and joy of completion. I'm yet to set up a LAN server and try to play with friends, but past experience with the non-Steam version was great. 

PROS:

Good maps? Check.
Amazing servers? Check.
Good weapon choice? Check.

(Personal favourites: Maps - Havana, Prodigy, Dust, Dust2, Nuke; Servers - Normal Terrorists vs. CT, Zombie servers; Weapons - AK-47, Machine Gun, Magnum Sniper Rifle)

CONS: 

Good graphics? Nope, but decent enough to thoroughly enjoy gameplay

All-in-all, I completely recommend making this cheap purchase - you get way more than what you pay for!

5329,"Read game, I really like the graphics, it-self better then 1.6, if the game would he more popular in the multi-player version it would be awesome."
5330,old game but cool!

Once again, a huge recommendation for CS:CZ Deleted Scenes as it offers a mission based singleplayer campaign, the likes of which had never been done before nor has been replicated since in Counter-Strike.

Get it on sale, though."

5374,"The more polished, better looking cousin of Counter Strike, Condition Zero is the version of Counter Strike to not only play, but for developers to beat.  The addition of the much-required shield has an important balance factor; it counters the usage of the AWP.

The hit detection is once again, superior to CSGO, much like the previous Counter Strike, and the aim for the weapons isn't cartoonishly exaggerated where you have weapons like the M249 and the shotgun being actually viable.

Online play is head-and-heels above CSGO's.  In CSGO you feel like everythings a waste of time unless you're playing in competitive matches, while in CSCZ, and CS, pubs rule the game (like all classic multiplayer games).  I can't say how sweet it was when someone who was clearly a CSGO player who looks like he just started playing CSCZ, killed a team mate to defuse the bomb himself, and then got perma-banned by the moderator.  It was also the moment where I realized that the behaviors of players in CSCZ compared to CSGO are not just different, but the CSGO behavior is just fucking awful and counter-intuitive to team work.  You have people competing fo points to get a higher rank quicker so that they can unlock more skins, which they can trade/sell for a hugely over-priced margin (some skins being worth more than CSGO itself).

I guess it just goes to show that if you're someone who actually wants to enjoy playing the game, CSCZ is the game for you.  CSGO is just another ""competitive"" game with nothing more to it than popularity, driven mostly by the market economy the game has created for itself, suffering the same fate as TF2 and Dota 2.

I would recommend CSCZ over CSGO any day and not because it's what I used to play (since I have none, as I barely ever touched it for more than a few minutes back in the day), but because the balance, design, and overall aesthetic is just so much more satisfying and fun to experience compared to more modern online FPS games.

5390,ok so i just played the game and i say this game is not that bad after all i haven't played multiplyer because there is not even around 100-200 players online which is a fair amount but this is cs the campaign is weird i played one mission the bot teams is just not that good of a defender of you they mostly ignore you and let you die and it sucks but because of the selection of bots that you can chose that gets better if you played more it feels like candy crush and mmo-ish games where you play more you get better loot progres easier(not really) but instead of loot you get better bots...which makes the game harder due to the fact that you have to make choices and only one mistake makes you lose and that makes it way harder to even choose a fucking bot when you can invite friends or random pepole but volvo fucked up again sorry valve but i'd rather play cs:go then cs:cz but hey i give some credits to you its again not to bad no more news showed up since 2014 and i'm making this review on april 2016 so yeah you can do what ever you like i don't care much i whould give this a solid 5.2/10 just need some fixes events news and etc...

5394,"Let me start off with im doing a review for counter-strike condition zero deleted scenes so lets get on with it.

the campaign is great and the graphics are nice in my opinion even though they are old graphics.
The campaign is that you take the role of many counter terrorists in different locations like africa and asia and also north america and south america and more,and the objectives are hard and fun.Also the flak jacket and the health packs and med kits work like in HL1 and HLOP but with no suit chargers so a flak jacket is very rare.
my opinion is when you see a terrorist that is shooting at you(BTW the snipers dont count)run away and let him come to you then shoot him.I hoped this helped and happy fighting to keep the world safe."

5410,"It's ok .. still got nothing on 1.6 tho , first bullet acc for all guns should be 100% the fact that it is not lowers the skill ceiling make for a rng experience catered to shit tier players. The recoil in this game is wonky as fuck too, they say the patterns are similar to that of 1.6 so it might not be the patter but maybe the recoil cool down ,bullet drop , bloom , or just some shit tier rng  that makes the spray ass. I 100% believe there should be recoil but going from spraying in 1.6 which was almost perfect to this is polar opposites .. something inbetween would of been much better. Other then that its worth buying but not getting a good rating."
5411,beated this game with hard mode :)
5412,My Laptop can run it at 100 fps. Yay.
5413,"This review is for the deleted scenes. Scroll down a bit more to read the review for the released gane,

It's interesting that they had a story mode for this game. I've already played the non-steam version of this game and the game looks unchanged. All the campaign seem to be how I remembered it as. But nevertheless, no idea why this part of the game was removed but hey, more hours to be spent on it!

The AI are the same from Half Life. Sound appears to be stereo only, and was able to play this game at 1080p, didn't have much settings customization as Half Life 2 and other games that run on the source engine though.

But yeah.....according to steam, it apparently took me a good 8 hr to finish the entire deleted scenes campagin on medium difficulty. I enjoyed it, though not as much as I did when I first played it, which was from the non-steam version of this, but good nostalgia playback though. I did idle for bit, whilst on breaks (dinner, lunch, etc,.) so it didn't actually take me 8 hrs, would have been 6 hrs as apparently I've clocked in about 2 hrs before I started from scratch, perhaps I was idling or already did the entire thing on easy or something before.....can't remember...but I've definitely now completed the game on medium difficulty - oh and I didn't even have to cheat either! I remember raging on the last level at the helicopter part so I  typed in god mode and sat back and relaxed.....hahahahaha, perhaps I was playing it on hard mode before? Because I did remember it being a bit harder last time I played it so maybe I did....or maybe I was just playing like shit before,......? Hahahahaha

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As for the release CS CZ game, there is also a campaign mode you can play, the AI in this is much more advance and smarter and not so dumb as the ones from the deleted scenes. However in this version, you get to spend points to recruit members onto your CS team. They also have stats that you may base your picks on. The difficulty ranges from Easy to Expert(when you first start it), so once you finish up on easy(or you can go straight to expert and work your way down to easy?), you get a badge on that and you can start on Normal and finish that and get a badge on that diff and so on.

Once in, the gameplay is similar to that to the multiplayer of the usual CS deathmatch, except that you are given objectives to do and you must carry those out in order to complete the map and then move on to the next until you finish the entire thing on whatever difficulty you chose and the rinse and repeat on a different difficulty if you so choose or if you''re bored from it, you can just start messing around in mutliplayer.

Other than the single player campagin mode, there's also a multiplayer game mode, if you've played CS 1.6, this is what this game mode is pretty much. CS team kill Ts and rescure hostages/defuse bombs whilst Ts kill CSs and plant C4s/hold hostages from CS team. There are many maps, more if you choose to add some custom made ones.

The graphics, well...the non-steam version I used to spend hrs and hrs on as a kid, looks very much more like CS 1.6 but with the usual CZ upgraded stuff and new additions too. [strike]In this steam version, the graphics look like they're from the deleted scenes.[/strike] I swear it was last time, just did another sample run and no it looks nothing like the graphics from the deleted scenes Not sure why the different graphics between the non-steam version and the steam version, but I guess this team version would also have bug/glitch fixes that the non-steam version doesn't have. But I'm sure if you google, there would probably be some offline patches you can run to update the non-steam version as well...Also there are a couple or so new things in the steam version vs. the non-steam version I used to play on as well. I must have got the first release of CZ where it looked very much more similar to the CS 1.6 now than the steam version of itself currently.

Also, vs. CS 1.6, this has bots! and not those dumb ones from Half Life! :P But of course that doesn't really add if you're not much of a PVB (Player Vs Bot) kind of person.

Audio is usual, stereo only, not much else to say here...there are other options like change to high quality or low quality sound.

Yeah, not sure what else I should say about it. Oh, they added another class to both CT and Ts which wasn't there in the non-steam version I used to play. And the crosshair mechanics are different too. But I suppose this version, at least the steam version of CS CZ is like a downgraded version of CSS, in my opinion from what I've just experienced and I've played CSS before this steam version of CS CZ and it's significantly different to the non-steam version of CS CZ I used to play.

-Review for Condition Zero

It's ok.

-Review for Deleted Scenes

This is stupidly frustrating. Easy is.. well... easy. Insultingly easy, that is. Medium and Hard? Almost impossible. Enemies fire the moment the see a single pixel of you, and rules constantly change about what surfaces you can and cannot shoot through. Ammo is rediculously scarce, with enemies not dropping a single bullet for you to pick up. 
Don't get me started on the fucking enemy weapons. They range from pistolarios, shotgun fuckers, assault rifles, MP9 users, and snipers. On medium and hard difficulty, they all do rediculous amounts of damage. Especially shotguns. Man, do I hate shotguns. The point of a shotgun is to do heavy damage at close range, right? In this game, enemy shotguns shave of 30 HP on Hard or Medium when in close range, and they take off 10-25 HP AT ANY DISTANCE ON HARD OR MEDIUM! I frequently found myself dying due to these fucking shotgun assholes; if not losing tons of health within seconds. It would be manageable if they had the pmup action, but no! They are equipped with the AUTOMATIC SHOTGUN! Your best hope is to stun them or get an instant kill... But wait! This game feels the need to treat NPC's like players and give them lots of fucking health! Enemies rarely flinch, and even more rarely die with headshots. The only 3 weapons that gaurantee an instakill with a headshot are the magnum sniper rifle, deagle, and LAW bazooka.

This game can also be stupidly buggy. Aside from enemies shooting me through walls and materials I can confirm could not be shot through by the player, I experienced a bug that made me quit playing Deleted Scenes(Minor spoiler warning!). During a chase sequence in which you have to capture the bad guy who has a nuke (how predictable), there are segments in which he will stop to order his man to come and assist him. Now during this part, the head honcho cannot be damaged. However, he and his fucking M60 can damage the player and slice off a nice chunk of health. In a hallway, I got sick of him and his goonies' shit, so I threw a grenade that killed all his men but him. Apparently this angered him to the point where he stormed down the stairs and stood defiently in front of me, as if he was about to give me a piece of his mind. Fate smiled upon me it seemed, as it allowed the flinching to work with every bullet I unloaded into his stupid flapping mouth that screamed russian profanities at me. After having exhausted the magazines in all 6 guns (You know how long CS weapons take to reload) that I had, the AI essentially said ""Nice job. My turn, faggot"" and fired A SINGLE BURST INTO MY FACE... I then quit the game, and have uninstalled it.

Unless you're sadistic, a fan of hardcore twitch shooters, or one of those CS gods, stay away from this."

5461,BEST GAME EVER SO MUCH BETTER THEN STUPID CS:GO
5462,This game is retarded. I played CS GO and it was so much better. If you have cash go buy that this is more retarded than goat simulator
5463,"Absolutely beautiful. The sounds, models, and everything in general are way better than CS 1.6, I highly recommend it."
5464,"If you are looking for a hard freaking core trainer to getting better at other counter strikes, here is where you should start. You will start out with bots that are super easy, but as you progress and get to the levels on hard difficulty they will be so freaking hard. I have only pumped about a dozen hours into this and it has DEFINANTLY helped me with my accuracy and problem solving skills on global offensive. This counter strike is considered to be the worse, but I can tell you it is FAR from that. I would reccomend getting this game for training to be better on other CS games, or to just have and extremelly fun and VERY challenging single player experience. This game is a must buy for PC gamers. Make sure to tweek the setting so even people with the crappiest PC's can play it at a rock solid 60 frames per second. Trust me, worth the buy."

5491,"I like the game a lot. There is a Singleplayer campaign which I have passed in 2.5h. 

I will do some pros and cons for the game

PROS
-The game comes with another game called Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes
-CS:CZDS has only Singleplayer which is very intriguing to pass, it has total of 19 missions and are very well made
-In CS:CZDS you fight different terrorist cells with different anti-terrorist groups so it's diverse
-The game has better graphics than Counter-Strike
-The game is fun to play even with bots
-Developers haven't forgot about this game, the games does not need any updates or patches
-Community is strong, so much players on 2500+ dedicated servers
-The game is cheap
-The Singleplayer Introduces you to all of the maps that are in Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, and introduces it very well
-The Multiplayer servers are defended with VAC so there are little to no hackers in this game

CONS
-I didn't like some of the Challenges because I have killed terrorists too fast and couldn't save the Hostages so I had to repeat it four to five times
-The graphics for player models have changed a little bit but they are still boxy

I recommend this game! 9/10 would kill five terrorists in row with M249 again"
5492,nice
5493,This is a game that will blow you away.  A Counter Strike title that has a single player campaign mode that you will enjoy playing.  The story is great but the levels could use a little more music.  The graphics are good and the game play can be pants poopingly easy to keyboard smashingly hard.  I highly recommend you to play this game.
5494,Good game :)
5495,"Yeah gr8

5516,"Based on the 1990 novel 'The Phantom Blooper'(written and illustrated by Gustav Hasford), Counter Strike: Condition Zero tells the story of a squad of elite dudes stuck behind enemy lines. Facing insurmountable odds, they make the heart rending decision to shoot every, man, woman, child and small dog they come across. This they perform with merciless success, and they eventually make way their way back home, only to be abducted by Doctor Who or something"

5532,"Synopsis:

[h1]With its extensive Tour of Duty campaign, a near-limitless number of skirmish modes, updates and new content for Counter-Strike's award-winning multiplayer game play, plus over 12 bonus single player missions, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a tremendous offering of single and multiplayer content. [/h1]

My thoughts regarding Condition Zero are pretty much Identical to the original CS 1.6. This is basically due to both games sharing the same engine, with Condition Zero being different only in the texturing and meshing department. With CS 1.6 showing its age, Condition Zero might be a worth a squirt if your feeling nostalgic. 

Basically once the game Is bought you have to two installation options, Counter Strike Condition Zero and Counter Strike Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes.

[b]Counter Strike Condition Zero:[/b]

This is essentially the CS 1.6 variant of the game which allows for traditional CS 1.6 style online gameplay and a somewhat enjoyable mini campaign which spans across most of the original maps, where objectives are the same as multiplayer however you can build a team for each map with bots of varying skills with more powerful bots costing more resource which you will unlock as you complete the maps. This single player should be avoided since it offers no real value and you are much better off playing on servers with real players.


[b]Counter Strike Condition Zero Deleted Scenes:[/b]

This installation covers the actual single player campaign for Condition Zero. Each theater consists of you playing as a different counter terrorist unit: 

GIGN, GSG-9, SEAL Team 6, SAS and Spetsnaz

You in turn fight againest a variety of different terrorist factions:

Arctic Avengers, Elite Crew, Guerilla Warfare, Phoenix Connexion and Midwest Militia.

I rather enjoyed the single player campaign since it deployed a large variety of maps and global locations ranging from fetid jungles to war ravaged cities. Most missions have a pre deployment briefing but these just offer simple intel and not much else. Most missions range from hostage rescue, bomb disarmament to assassinations. In most respects the campaign is somewhat reminiscent to Call of Duty MW which often puts you in the boots of a different soldier serving under a different army.

In conclusion CS CZ is worth your time if you are a hardcore C.S 1.6 fan like myself. It is pretty much HD 1.6 with a enjoyable single player campaign."

5542,"I really like this game.

Back when Counter-Strike wanted to try to make a campaign mode. 
The game was based of mini.objective against bot on different maps, and the ''Deleted Scenes'' was extra off the full Counter-Strike Campain, with many elements of the online game being brought in with solo FPS gameplay mechanics to have a fun game. 

The multiplayer is very similar to the orginal but still have some better textures than the orginal, in my opinion.

Really bring up some memory when i was young. Still love all old CS games.

1.6 will always be in our history!"
5543,Oh really Valve ?
5544,this game always be my best game
5545,;)
5546,why not?
5547,Still the best game i know
5548,"Holy cow.
I'm not really sure how to start this review because I started off with the game being a crappy and basically I had boughten a basically different modeled CS-1.6, lets get down to it?

Multiplayer:
I didn't get to play too much of this, mainly because there are not too many servers with players, I didn't get to play a few skrim matches though, fun stuff, basically 1.6 (I believe 1.5 was out when this game was available) I don't have too much to talk about here, maps are somewhat different from the original texture wise, there are a few added items like a shield w/ sidearm.

Single player:
Mainly the reasons why I was interested in this was because of talk of a campaign, when you buy the game, you will find two games in your library, Counter strike condition zero and counter strike condition zero 'Deleted scenes'. 

Huh, deleted scenes, does not sound that interesting in a game without a story, sounds like something a goldsrc modder would use, open up the regular game to come to a familiar titlepage, when you open up the single player, you are only basically taken to what operations we get in csgo, killing boats for challenges... No story, no different maps, same deal with increasing difficulty, there are plenty of these missions because each difficulty you can select has missions of their own. This was very disappointing and was not worth the $2 price tag, I groaned to myself and probably played five missions before giving up. It was the silliest idea ever. Looking at the games screenshots, there looked like there would at least be  some characters and an okay plot! But sadly what we were given was this ""Bot killer simulation 1997"". I was greatly disappointed and would have been bothered even more if I had bought this on CD format. Untill. 

The deleted scenes, who would want to go through that? Well I mean I would, I like to see beta content or removed items and such and that's all I was expecting. Most people are not into that, but I installed that puppy anyways, on the title you are given the option to go to a map screen and start a new game. What I saw five hours that night was one of the best games I have experienced in awhile. WE were actually given a story! Well not really, you were basically pulled into a quick briefing and pulled into chaos, my eyes were glued to the screen. Honestly it felt like I was playing a half life game with realistic environment for its time, wait a minute. What's that say on the wikia for CS condition zero? The game had three development teams? The deleted scenes were made by gearbox?!?!? No freaking wonder the missions were awesome, I have poured five hours into the game and I'm not even half way done, there had to be at least 20 missions all taking place in different environments, one moment you are American in an middle eastern city underseige, the next you are shooting your own comrades in an russian mission plant. Literally, this game (deleted scenes) was amazing and I feel that valve really should had reconsidered gearboxes version of the game."
5549,Foarte fain :d
5550,Nice game
5551,"Nah, classic. fun. ridiculous"
5552,"jumped in a game online and wanted to blow my brains out becuase the graphics were lagging my computer. after figuring out how to turn the graphics to less than sand i had to turn down the volume because of all the squeakers and people claiming they are mlg and insulting all the new players (including me). after muting them, i got to enjoy my experience for about two seconds before being spawn killed a few times. contemplaiting playing with bots for the rest of my life. regardless, i suggest waiting for a sale to buy this game unless you will play the shit out of it"

5556,"The Best Game!!!
10/10!!!"
5557,Still better story than twilight.
5558," Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is one of the more intriguing installments of Counter-Strike (Not including CS Neo, CS     Online, and CS Zexon Zombies) Its basically just a single player campaign for Counter-Strike and it shows this in two different fashtions. First there's Condition Zero where you go through Counter-Strikes multiplayer maps pairing up with a group of bots against other bots. The bots AI aren't the worst as they can be useful as depending on there cooperative abilitys, they'll alarm about any incoming enemys. But the bots aren't perfect like how enemie bots will take a couple of seconds that your right in front of them and that they should shoot. Each mission includes its own set of missions that are required to beat before completing the mission like kill a certain number of enemies, rescue a hostage, kill a certain number of enemies with a shotgun, and so on. This also includes multiplayer with the new maps and textures with it, but nowadays its rare to find at least two servers with a decent number of players. However getting the game on steam will give you the original Counter-Strike so its not a huge loss. 

 Then there's Deleted scenes, which was originally Ritual Entertainments idea for Condition Zero. The 18 missions are very Half-Life based with Counter-Strike theming and and assets. Each mission has you going through hoards of terrerosts that act like the military from Half-Life, and complete your objective to complete. The engine has been given some major improvements like enimies having special knockback deaths and high resolution textures. It does show some parts where the games not finished, but it's preety hard to notice. The voice acting can range from mildly cheesy, to chringeworthy with the rediculous accents. Overall, the difficulty can be preety challenging for newcomers, but pros of Counter-Strike shoulden't have much of a problem.

 If you're a fan of booth Half-Life and Counter-Strike, then you should definatly check out Deleted scenes. And Condition Zero is also a great excuse to play Counter-Strike offline, but otherwise you should just play online with the newest installments.

 Final Verdict:

 Condition Zero: 7/10

 Deleted Scenes: 8/10"
5559,"It's a lot of fun, but take it in sales."

5578,"My second favorite Counter Strike. Wait wait wait, put down the pitchforks and don't downvote. Hear me out. This is my second favorite for a number of reasons. First, it plays like the retro 1.6 but with much improved mechanics. The hitboxes are far more improved, and the weapons are executed much better. CS:CZ keeps the retro from 1.6 and improves upon it heavily. Also, avoid the single player. Not all improvements are actual improvements."
5579,"It's a Counter-Strike game which have singleplayer campaign. 
Campaign mode is in game named: Deleted Scenes.
It sucks... You will can get regret from buying Counter-Strike Complete pack."

5589,"[h1] Is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive worth to buy? [/h1] - [b] Yes! [/b]

[i]Even if you are not really into the shooter genre, CS:GO is probably the best game to get things started. Not only does it have a huge variety in game modes and also community mods, it is the best game to reach a decent aim you can profit from in other shooters.[/i]

[h1] What mods can you play in CS:GO? [/h1]

[i]There are plenty, the mods variety is huge. I really have not played a lot of mods, since I am more into the competetive Counter-Strike, but I for example played zombie-mods, hunger-games-mods, surf maps (with and without rpg mod), bunnyhop and awp_noscope. [b]BUT[/b] there are many more mods to that.

[h1] What are the key aspects of the game? [/h1]
[list]
    [*] Casual: Bomb/Hostage Maps
    [*] Demolition: Bomb Maps
    [*] Gungame
    [*] Deathmatch
    [*] Competitive (Matchmaking)
[/list]

[b][u]Casual[/u][/b]
[i]In casual play mode, you will basicly spawn every round (1 life per round) and fight agains the opposite team (10 vs 10). You can play either bomb maps (where you have to plant/defuse a bomb) or hostage maps (where you have to defend hostages or rescue them). You can choose between the official competetive map pool (which does not include hostage maps) or reserve group (where you have both types). You will usually spawn with kevlar+helmet, and defuse kit (not on hostage maps).[/i]

[b][u]Demolition[/u][/b]
[i]In demolition play mode you play 5v5 on small bomb maps and you also have only one live. You spawn with kevlar+helmet and a weapon that will change ever round where you have killed an enemy (+grenades if you make multiple kills the same round).[/i]

[b][u]Gungame[/u][/b]
[i]In gungame play mode you will play 10v10 on small gungame maps, where you have to kill an enemy with a pre-set weapon (everyone starts with the same weapons). Once you killed two enemies, you will progress to the next weapon. You win after you reached knife level and killed a player with the ""golden knife"". [b] Note:[/b] Every player must go through the same exact weapons to win and the weapons are randomized.[/i]

[b][u]Deathmatch[/u][/b]
[i]In deathmatch play mode you will play 10v10 on the same maps as on casual play mode. You will spawn with the weapons you choose through the buymenu (kevlar+helmet are already purchased for you). You have multiple lives and can always change your weapons after you died. One game ends after 10 Minutes and the winner with the highest score wins. You gain points by killing enemies or assist in killing them OR by killing chickens (which gives 1 point only per chicken).[/i]

[b][u]Competitive (Matchmaking)[/u][/b]
[i]In competitive play mode, you will basicly play like casual but different. You will play 5v5 with people of your same skillgroup on the same maps as on casual (You can choose specific maps!!). If you want to get serious with Counter-Strike this will be the game mode you are looking for, BUT keep in mind that you need a lot of knowledge about the game for this type of play mode (and you need at least community rank 3 to play competitive).[/i]


[b]>> Note: [/b] [spoiler] Keep in mind, that the game changes a lot, so do the game modes. I wrote this 29.01.2016, so any changes after I probably did not predict ;) [/spoiler]

[code] So all in all Counter-Strike is at the moment my favorite shooter, since all others (even new ones like ""Rainbow Six Siege"") are not as much fun as Counter-Strike is. Especially the competitive aspect of the game is way better than others. [/code]

5599,"Like the classic ""Counter-Strike"". Although this(Counter-Strike: Condition Zero - Deleted Scenes) is a ""Singleplayer"" only mode. It's the storyline of ""Counter-Strike"". With a bit improved graphics and models. It's nice, but a bit short, the whole storyline is a maximum of 5 hours. All that matters is that it's fun.
On the other hand(Counter-Strike: Condition Zero). Has absolutely no difference compared to ""Counter-Strike"", except for a few ""Singleplayer"" missions(which are like normal games, but instead of players with bots) and the updated models of the maps, weapons and so on. Still it's not a bad update, but the classical ""Counter-Strike""(1.6) is still better. But I'm not saying it's(Condition Zero) bad, I like it - but it's not much to go around."

11/10"
5601,errwan dont like diz wan but i like et kuz der is bots n is like wan . sex
5602,I would like some help regarding this game. I love Counter strike but i have problems in this version the deleted scens version. Where you have missions in going global. I¬¥m stock at Latvia. I cannot go in the pipe after passing the terrorists sleeping. Really appreciate if theres someone that could help me fix it so i could go on to the next mission. Thanks guys.
5603,Nice and awesome. better graphics. New maps and statregies
5604,"Condition Zero comes with 2 modules:
[b]1. Condition Zero (CZ)[/b] - Provides a slightly different MP experience to that of CS1.6, mostly graphical changes with a few gameplay changes. Also has a player vs. bots singleplayer mode, which is essentially just multiplayer with bots instead of humans, but with added objectives to make it a bit more difficult.
[b]2. Deleted Scenes[/b] - A scripted single player campaign similar to something you'd see in Quake or Unreal Tournament.

For simplicity's sake I'll go over the changes CZ introduces, just keep in mind this isn't something I've thoroughly researched or anything of the sort, just what I know from playing multiple versions of CS for around a decade now. If you don't know the core gameplay of Counter Strike to understand these changes... well then go buy 1.6 and then consider picking up CZ.

[u][b]Changes[/b][/u]
[list]
[*]Lighting - Lighting is updated to be more smooth and natural, shadows and darkness is generally not as harsh and saturation looks much more natural, in my opinion this is a good change both aesthetically and gameplay wise, excluding the saturation change. I would prefer deeper saturation to make things easier to see and more colorful. You can somewhat counteract this by using a setting called digital vibrance in the NVidia control panel. If you have an AMD card they have a similar setting, though I do not know what it is called.
[*]Gun Models - Gun models are updated to look more realistic and metallic, most have changed color palettes or just added color in general and a select few have new animation, mostly just moving parts, for instance the bolt on the FAMAS/Clarion now moves when firing. Also the knife has a new animation which I think looks awful. Overall this is a positive change though.
[*]Character Models - Character models are completely changed. They are higher resolution but in my opinion the new models look lame in comparison to the 1.6 models.
[*]Textures - Pretty much every texture on the maps have been changed and made higher resolution. For the most part the changes are welcome to me, though they do effect the visual feel of the maps a little. I think I'd consider this a positive change.
[/list]

Outside of the additions I mentioned at the beginning of the review, that's really the extent of the changes. Mostly all visual changes.

So the question is... do these changes warrant a purchase? Not in the slightest. For various reasons, if you're buying this for multiplayer, you're better off just playing 1.6.

In my eyes, the only reason to pick up CZ is for the Deleted Scenes. However I don't believe Deleted Scenes is actually worth the $10 CZ goes for.

Basically the campaign is a collection of missions with no overarching story or really anything of interest in the way of plot. They are all linear. They take place in different locales around the world. They are all played on the CT side, although the factions will differ. They offer a very small amount of puzzle solving. They have boss fights. They have forced stealth sections.

Here is what I dislike about Deleted Scenes:
[list]
[*]Linear as hell, wouldn't be a problem if it didn't give you the illusion of choice with multiple hallways and doors just leading to dead ends, often without an item reward.
[*]Secrets are hidden pretty lazily and without thought, even when you go out of your way to look for them you probably won't find a majority of them, and when you do find them, they are mostly useless.
[*]Enemy placement has very little thought, often times they are placed in dark corners or closed doors. If they are placed somewhere that requires a scripted animation, they are completely invincible until the animation plays out.
[*]Boss battles are awful, all of them but the final 2 bosses are insanely easy. The 2nd to last boss is just a bullet sponge that can take literally several AK clips to the head and numerous grenades before he dies, but he can kill you just as quick as any other enemy, not to mention he's surrounded by 2 shot kill snipers AND you are on a timelimit to kill him. Just awful. The last boss is actually pretty good and a satisfying finale, but he also has 2 bullet sponge troops that will kick your ass if you don't cheese them somehow.
[*]The game is incredibly easy, even on hard. The only time I was challenged was the aforementioned bosses and when I had to escort the retarded AI.
[*]Escorting AI is just plain awful.
[*]The most fun guns run out of ammo quickly.
[*]You can get trapped by AI very easily.
[*]Some puzzles are very difficult not because they require you to use your brain but rather because they require you to go around knifing random things (MULTIPLE TIMES) until something breaks, and it's rarely obvious what you should be attacking.
[*]Allied AI is useless
[*]Enemy AI is braindead. Most of the time they just stand in one spot and shoot at you, never trying to get to a better position.
[*]The forced stealth is AWFUL. It's dreadfully boring and boils down to crouching behind a box, waiting for enemy to turn back, moving to next box, waiting for enemy to turn back, rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat, over and over again and it always left me wanting to just quit playing it was so boring and uninspired. More guns, less sneaking. PLEASE.
[/list]

With that said, I think Deleted Scenes is a fairly average FPS when it's at it's best. When at it's worst it is just plain bad. Unless you're a die hard CS fan that wants to experience it, there are so many other games to spend your time and money on.

Oh and I didn't even mention the fact that this came out in 2004. Half Life 2 came out 7 months after this. Take a second to think about that."

But you can get nexon zombies for free so you might not need to get this seeing as there both nearly the same....

The Deleted Scenes is just awful, hands down.
After being made the same year as Half-Life 2, one of the best single-player games out there was just a huge disaster

Basically CS:CZ Deleted Scenes is like a Call Of Duty Campaign but not even worth it.

5650,"It's more like interesting fact, then real game.
It's fulfilled by bugs, and map defects. Models don't work as they should. And gameplay is shitty.
Music? There is no music. This is just cs 1.6 put into strange ???storyline?? - it's not working. 
 You can try, but not for more then 1$"
5651,"""Condition Zero"" is only worth as the cheapest way to get CS 1.6 on Steam. Otherwise it adds very little over plain CS. All the bugs remain (door and etc) and the bots are as stupid as they can be."
5652,"After countlessly playing CSGO, Counter Strike original called me for no odd reason. I decided to buy it and wow, the game does lack graphics and resolution, but brings so much memories to almost 4-5 years ago! It's a classic. I hope they could remaster or somehow bring back Counter Strike original so its graphics do get improved and see how different they both looked from year 2000 till today

5682,"Altrhough no one like to talk about condition zero, It is a very fun way to practice and learn to play counter strike, With it's meaningful challenges and progressively harder difficulty, definitly worth playing."
5683,gggggg
5684,"Counter Strike Condition Zero is the sequel to the original Counter Strike and now it includes a Single Player Campaign, so let's take a look shall we ?

When I mentioned that this game has a single player campaign, I didn't mean a story mode. The single player campaign is a very short bundle of missions where you have few objectives during each missions. Like rescue hostages, defuse bombs and take out terrorists with a specific weapon.

The missions are incredibly short and you can finish all 12 within 2 hours. 

The AI will make the hostage missions a living hell. Once the round starts the AI are on the hunt to find any enemy player on the field and will not help you so don't expect any help from the AI. Getting a hostage to a drop off, before your team kills the entire enemy team.

The gameplay is not much different from the original Counter Strike so don't expect a major change.

Now for the feature everyone cares. THE MULTIPLAYER. It's almost completely dead. I had trouble finding a match and when I did get into a full lobby match, I felt bored and it's not as good as the original Counter Strike.

This game is not good, but it's not horrible either. The campaign is short and not worth the money and the multiplayer is slowly dying out. In the end only get this if you're a hardcore fan, otherwise get any other game in the franchise.

Final Rating:
6/10 - Okay

5686,great game
5687,"I played through this game today thinking I would find something I could enjoy because I have enjoyed CS:GO quite a bit. When I first booted it up all I could find where missions that just wanted me to play on the multiplayer against bots. I really dislike playing with the bots because they are not real players and they do very stupid things. I found no appeal in these missions.

Then there was the Deleted Scenes. A Single-player campaign that I just couldn't really get into. It was more cheesy than Call of Duty was back when this game released and is even more cheesy than the newer Call of Duty games because of how over the top it is.

This game is dull and if you own any other Counter-Strike game there is no reason to get this game."
5688,bad
5689,Exclusive Condition Zero Game . I like most this game .when my net slower and gud work in Condition Zero
5690,"If you never played CS 1.6 (Or similar), dont try this. This game and it's ""accuracy"" will infuriate you. However, if you have played CS 1.6 and want to play some missions, this game is for you. Play some missions vs bots and upgrade your teammates as you go. Fun, short little campain to have a little fun with."

5698,good
5699,"Wow. I missed this when it was new, I got it in a CS bundle and wow. Counter-Strike Condition Zero is a single player trainer, but the real jewel is CS Condition Zero Deleter Scenes. It's a single player campaing. It's dreadful. Linear, unimaginative, not really challenging but still, wow.

Get your nostalgia hats and game on!!

1999/10, would travel to the past again."
5700,aweawesone gen!
5701,awesome game worth a crack not many aussie servers active however you can play against bots

5706,"Bought the game on sale  and replayed all the missions to relieve the nostalgia I had when I was young <3

10/10 worth it"
5707,Great strategy and team based fps.
5708,"This game is pretty behind for its time, but still pretty fun in all of its, action b-movie cheesiest glory."
5709,good
5710,not bad
5711,It's a classic. x2
5712,"Back when Counter-Strike tried a campaign mode. 

The game is a series of mini-objectives against bots on various maps, while the Deleted Scenes extra is a full blown CS campaign with many elements of the online game being brought in with solo FPS gameplay mechanics (such as equipment) to make a fun and hilarious game (the stereotypical russian accents make me laugh every time). 

The multiplayer part is quite similar to the original CS but with slightly better textures.

Overall, this isn't a game for people who like CS:GO, it's more for the fans of old school FPS games and OG Counter-Strikers. I do recommend it nonetheless, but keep in mind that the game is over 10 years old."
5713,best
5714,"If someone played cs 1.6, this game has got the same shooting physics and movement. I like bots in this game, valve should copy bots from CS:CZ to CS:GO because bots in csgo are worse than silver 1 players. If you like csgo, cs 1.6 or cs source you would probably like this game too."
5715,I spent all my life playing this.
5716,my very first game on steam xD

5719,Cannot play at all... keep on hang out
5720,I remember that I used to play this game a lot years back. Aah...that nostalgic feeing! Valve should make more mission based games like this in CS franchise.......atleast I hope they will :)
5721,nice
5722,love the game but it make me rage so fuckin much overall its a good game
5723,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a follow up to the original Counter-Strike game. This game was released in 2004, so almost eleven years ago. Condition Zero uses the Half-Life engine."
5724,good gam3
5725,Classic. Funny how simple is still immensely fun...
5726,"I didn't play the main game, but rather the deleted scenes.. and they seem sooooo long. Pretty fun actually. Famas is a joke though. ""Burst fire"" basicly uses 3 bullets up but shoots one special magnum round rather than burst."
5727,Best game for COD+CS fans

5730,cool singleplayer
5731,good:))
5732,It is great game and the community is still there and it is not near as toxic as CSGO.
5733,CS!
5734,They say its deleted but i can still play it
5735,cs:cz is the most boring game ever its like counter strike 1.6 but story mode and with bots and i hate that
5736,"What is this a counterstrike SINGLEPLAYER, DUN DUN DUN"
5737,NIIIICE $$
5738,"My first FPS game & a personal favorite, I higly recommend."
5739,So I tryed loading the game and it shows like a 1 in by 1 in square and thats all i can see from the game. So if anyone can help me then that would be greatful.
5740,"This is game is good because I can shoot dirty vermin in the face.
10/10"
5741,ok
5742,I had no idea what I was doing
5743,"Very, very different from the other Counter Strike games I've played. Yet, this is really fun. Just like a counter strike 1.6 game, BUT WITH CAMPAIGN! That makes it more different from the other series. If your connection is down, this is the game for you."
5744,good
5745,very good ja
5746,"A Good Game, without this I dont know if i still can play CS:GO"
5747,I've enjoyed it so far
5748,You know iv'e played this game for more than 2000+ hours and still haven't gotten bored of it. What an amazing game!!!
5749,It's actually pretty fun.
5750,"It's different. -Abraham ""Kennedy"" Bush"
5751,The old classic. I played a lot of this back in the days before I bought it on steam. de_dust2 never changes :p
5752,"CS:CZ is really just a single player campaign for CS. It isn't amazing but, if you are CS fan, you will enjoy CS:CZ."
5753,"nice
"
5754,not  much of a cs game what a shame !!
5755,"That's a classics allright. Could't been better, for my taste. Great game, Recommended too anyone."
5756,Good story like a millitary version of half life.
5757,This game is like the retarded kid of the Counter Strike franchise and yet I really like it. Very nice when on vacation without internet connection.
5758,Good game
5759,Pretty nice.Gets boring after a while
5760,"It's so sad. The game is like nothing i have ever seen in counter strike. But it is left in the dust as one of the most unknown valve games. I love the idea of a campaign that isn't a cheap p2p scam. The mechanics are also beautiful with the radio, cell phone, and camera. I just want there to be at least a remake of this in the near future. Or even a source port."
5761,"when i got this game for 10.00 dollars i thought it would be good. But nope, when i run  it all it does is go to a black  screen and plays crappy music. I don not reccomend this game
"
5762,fun game
5763,ces cool

5776,"This game is a very addictive First-Person shooter, which even by its age is still played by thousands of players and I personaly find it very relaxing to its multiplayer and singleplayer capabilities. I recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS games which can be played alone or with friends, casualy or competitivly. 
 
I r8 it 8/8 m8.

5777,idk i never played it lol
5778,Very nice and awesome game.

5784,1.6 > CZ
5785,good.
5786,Awesome game. Even in 2015 im still playing it :)

5788,"Great game, I didn't have the opportunity to play it as much as the original Counter-Strike back in the day, but this one kicks ass, it's as great as the first CS, and now I have the chance to run this master piece on linux, it runs very well, everything works just fine! amazing on Ubuntu 15.10.

15/10"
5789,"CS:CZ is a little speciality. It dosen't run on Windows 7 yet it can on Windows XP. So if you only have Windows 7, then don't buy it, cause it won't run. However CS:CZ is a great game, especialy the deleated scenes. Don't bother reading the bad reviews, this game is worth it's money. (Updated) I got it to run, just run it with XP mode, just google it."
5790,"The game I started with. This was my entry in the Counter Strike scene. I started off with offline missions, then started playing on Multiplayer servers of the US (PGN) where I met some Indian friends. It all started when I met xTRMz^ and it's admins.. there began my story of Counter:Strike and the legend is carried forward to CS:GO!

The legend shall survive.
No, I didn't start with 1.6. CS:CZ is quiet similar to CZ, btw."
5791,"Still my favorite Counter Strike game in the series till this day, although I wish alot more people still played it. Also loved playing the single player missions"
5792,this game is great
5793,"Dont get where all the hate comes from.

Its not all that bad a game, essentially just CS 1.6 with better offline gameplay but not as good online."
5794,I hate the fact that i still can't seem to create a dedicated server with CS:CZ. Tried everything on the internet without any succes. A pretty disturbing issue to me.

5796,"American foreign policy simulator
you get to run for president if you kill a terrorist with a secondary weapon
liberal edition now featuring knife fights under imporsed gun restrictions"
5797,IT sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5798,"Basically Counter Strike 1.6 but with retextured maps (yes, original maps from 1.6 with original textures remain in the game). Has couple of model and sound changes to the weapons. The engine is the same as in 1.6 - modified hl engine. It has really different atmosphere, than cs:go or css.. I would say it is more fun, but on the other hand, cs:go is more competetive, with the ranking/matchmaking system.. I would rate this game 8/10, because its great fun and it remembers me the old times, when I was young, playing cs 1.6 =)."
5799,"Counter-Strike 1.6: The Phantom Pain is a Single Player First-Person Shooter that takes you through the lives of numerous Counter-Terrorism units. 

The story is linear and all counter-terrorism units depicted are not connected. Most gameplay is a tutorial for a mundane version of VR missions, a prime example being your very first sneeki beeki-like S.A.S mission, where you, the main unoriginal protagonist of Dissappointment Ops 3, is instructed to infiltrate and exfiltrate from Prague or something to stop a train from going boom and to locate Metal Gear Supercomputer."
5800,it is fun and enjoyable to pay with friends and people online

5803,better than csgo and source. source is the worst
5804,"A good way of experiencing Counter-Strike without all the stress of playing with other players. You can assemble a team of bots and fight in different maps, each with different missions to complete (kill people with a certain weapon, rescue hostages etc.) You can create custom mission-packs or download from others.

Also, deleted scenes is the badass single-player CS we all wanted. Go for it. You will not regret it."

I have this problem with CS:CZ

two years from the original report on this forum and the problem is still there. for me is OSX but seams to be on all OSs Shame on you!"
5806,old times
5807,Good
5808,"not sure why my profile only shows 48 minutes, because I played this game for 2 years straight before steam became all fancy and stuff.
I still concider this the best CS out there. It has the gamepla of 1.6/1.5 and netcode that was very smooth.
One of the best balanced hitboxes and recoil.
Very skill rewarding game. Loved the community in this game.

5814,"basically 1.6 with new textures and better models,
and it comes with people who actually speak english."
5815,Classic. The brainchild of the Call of Duty Modern Warfare series.

5818,"I like this game pretty much 

but some things are pretty weird :3"
5819,I was stuck at Mission 4 - Building Recon.... at a supid ladder. I could not go on... maybe it was a bug or I don't know how to press button.

5822,yes
5823,well i like this game its fun p.s i got it free when i got counter strike
5824,nice game :P
5825,Actually the best counter strike
5826,Good game!
5827,"I miss the old times when you needed to buy ammunation for every weapon, and when you were enabled to buy tactical shield. You don't have that on CS:GO. Highly recommended, buy this game, you will enjoy.  10/10"
5828,"Ah, Condition Zero. The red-headed stepchild of the Counter-Strike world.
Pity that, it's a really good game.   Since I have a damaged computer at the moment, with limited 3d accel.  I can't
run Source-engine games.   This one uses the original Half-Life/Counter-Strike mod's Goldsrc.

This version is a bit nicer than CS 1.6, and is quite a bit more polished.   There is some activity on the servers, if you're into multiplayer.  The maps are quite nice-looking for a old quake-engine game.  The included versions of Cobblestone and Aztec look great are a blast to play.

I got it as part of a bundle, and it's been one of the best buys I've made on Steam.   Absolutely recommend.
(don't get me wrong, CS:GO is great, but don't pass this one up because it's old).   For n00bs, its a great intro to the
CS world."

It's sad that the gameplay was inferior to the cs1.6 this is one of the reasons cs1.6 stood at 1st palce and that's probably why we couldn't go to eSport with that one.

Anyway I still recomend this game at 90% of cs players, for the fun and old memories !"
5835,only play it becuase my linux brick canr un it as well as my win 8 can run csgo and borderlands
5836,2 old make it new and better and not jewish ples

5843,"CZ is only a ""improved"" version of cs 1.6 but it's still fun. 
9/10"
5844,Some deleted scenes should stay deleted...
5845,I've played CSZ for 10+ years.  but the old ways are gone. people move on. thats just how life is
5846,excelent!!!
5847,just like it for nostagia
5848,"As a fan of classic shooters this game is Counter Strike with a story and a better overrall hit detection from the original game (I know some people are used to it but I am not). Play this game. It came late in the development of the counter strikes and only a few months before Source which seems like a major reason to simply not play this game because of the fact. I liked this game and got a couple good fun hours out of it. Thanks.

8/10 - It was worth it and definitely better than just Condition Zero"
5849,"condition zero indeed

because the condition here is that everybody gives zero fucks about this game


hahahahahahhaaha so fani"
5850,Nice!!!
5851,nice fps game
5852,Best
5853,Yea....
5854,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is basically 'just' a slightly improved version of Counter-Strike 1.6.
If you happen to be unfamiliar with the CS games series, the concept of the idea is simple.
Players play against eachother in online matches, choosing to play either a terrorist or a counter terrorist. The team that completes their objective or eliminates the opposing team wins.

Counter-Strike is a fairly old game, built on the Half-Life engine, that became extremely popular years ago and is one of the best known shooter games (series) ever made, alongside eg. Unreal Tournament, Doom, Call of Duty and other such classics. And thanks to a large community, there is a huge amount of custom content available for these games. As long as you have some people to play with, it's hard to get bored in the world of Counter-Strike. And Condition Zero is no exception to this.

What most people familiar with the series can tell you is that while CZ is a decent game, it is highly underrated compared to both older and newer installments. Why is this? Well there may be several reasons, but the easiest way to put it is this: it's the middle child of CS games.
CS purists will prefer to play the original Counter-Strike, versions 1.5 and 1.6. And the newer games draw a big crowd because they're flashier and fancier. Since Condition Zero is situated in between the older 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source (which started using the new Source engine), it doesn't get much of the attention it deserves, in my opinion. However, I can tell you that it is definitely a game worth playing if you're into slightly older shooting games.
--------------------
More information...

-=Gameplay=-
Q: How is it played?
A: After joining a server, you have four options. You can join one of two teams, you can let the game decide for you which team you'll join or you can spectate the game, basically existing as a ghost, watching others play. You can play as a counter-terrorist operative or as a terrorist. The moment you spawn (when a new round starts, or within seconds of a round starting) you're able to open a menu that allows you to buy weapons, protection and various equipment. If the round has not yet started, you are unable to move. If you picked a team seconds after the round started, you will instantly be able to move. Everyone spawns with a basic pistol and a little bit of money. Once you're able to move, your goal is to move out of the spawn area and attempt to complete any of your objectives to earn more money and to win the round. When the round is over, everyone respawns in the same area as last round and the game is repeated. If you died, you'll start over with your gear, otherwise you keep what you had before. You will keep playing rounds until the server changes to a different map (level), usually after 20 minutes. There are a couple of standard game types, determined not by server options but by the type of map that is being played. The three main types are bomb defusal, hostage rescue and assassination. There are other types, but those are only featured in custom maps. Completing just ONE of the listed objectives will win a team the round and earn additional money for all of it's members.

*Bomb defusal
-Terrorists must plant a bomb in one of two possible bomb sites and make sure it explodes. (the team still wins if the bomb explodes while all it's members are dead)
-Terrorists must kill all counter-terrorists.
-Counter-terrorists have to kill all terrorists.
-Counter-terrorists must defuse the bomb if it is planted. (the team still wins if all CT players are killed after the bomb has been defused)

*Hostage rescue
-Terrorists must stay alive and keep the counter-terrorists from rescuing all living hostages.
-Terrorists have to kill all the counter-terrorists.
-Counter-terrorists have to rescue all the living hostages.
-Counter-terrorists have to kill all the terrorists.

*Assassination
-Terrorists must keep the VIP from the rescue zone while staying alive themselves.
-Terrorists have to kill the VIP.
-Counter-terrorists have to kill all the terrorists.
-Counter-terrorists have to get the VIP player (picked at random) to the rescue zone within a specific time limit.

-=Experience=-
CZ is an old game. It runs on an old engine. It looks, feels and sounds old. Quite simply, if you can't stand anything but HD graphics, realistic water effects, decent ragdoll physics and other such things, this is not the game for you. That said, there's enough to keep it interesting. Weapons all sound and behave differently and it takes practice to get good with each (type). The maps are diverse enough in types of environment. It's worth mentioning that in a game like this, the maps are relatively small, forcing players into confrontation to keep the game going at a decent pace. Because the action is usually fast and intense, you will usually be too distracted to really notice what your surroundings sound or look like. For some interesting experiences, try a few custom maps! Made by members of the community, you'll find the craziest levels. Themed ones, maps based on popular films or tv series and just insane maps that seem to be all over the place. Shake things up by customising your game and trying out new things.

-=Technical, controls, etc.=-
Again, CZ is a fairly old game. As long as you can get the game started, you're not going to have issues with this. It's pretty stable and even if you do suffer a bug or error, you will easily find a solution for it through Google, thanks to the large amount of players who have played this and other CS/HL games over the years.
It's extremely small compared to modern games and will take up very little space, even if you start adding custom content to it and customising it further. For anyone with a normal internet connection you can download this game very quickly.
Controls are what you're used to in PC shooters. Pretty intuitive and unsurprising. Thankfully, if there's anything that is not working how you want it to, you can change it. Controls can be changed in the options menu and if there's anything not listed in there, you can always find a way to fix it by using the developers console. This may sound complicated if you're a casual PC user/gamer, but again, the community has made sure that there's enough information for you to figure things out without spending a lot of time doing research and basically missing out on actually playing and enjoying the game.
Besides regular user controls, there are also enough options and commands by default for server owners (you, if you're hosting a game) to keep control of the match. These can be expanded upon greatly by installing an administrative modification on your game (server) and again, there's enough information for anyone with limited computer knowledge to succeed in this endeavour.

Pro's:
-Basically an improved Counter-Strike 1.6
-Extremely and easily customisable with a lot of custom content available
-Easy to learn, hard to master
-Features working bots (not brilliant ones in gameplay, though) and the game can ""learn"" custom maps and make waypoint files for the CZ bots automatically. They work in multiplayer too
-Comes with Deleted Scenes, separate game on the same engine that has you playing a proper SP campaign, going across the world to stop terrorist activity in scripted missions.

Cons:
-Highly underrated and not well known, will not have as much players as other CS games (best played with friends)
-Somewhat pricey, unless you're planning on playing it a lot, despite the content available and given with just the game itself

5855,it's alright.
5856,nice Game :D
5857,WORST GAME EVER 0/10 DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY
5858,.
5859,"at release, this was a half-decent dlc."
5860,"FOR SINGLE PLAYER:
A really odd version of Counter-Strike, definitely does not feel like 1.6, CZ, CSS, or GO.  Missions are fun, hard, and engaging, even though the storyline is super cheesy.  Great game overall."
5861,It's a good game
5862,This game is amazing. When i get tired of csgo i play the mission on here.
5863,"Great game, old school yet exciting"
5864,10/10 Goblin Legs
5865,"//Bought as a Combo Pack CS+CZ

CS is definitely a great old mod of HL. No doubt it has given me fun. I played pirated version for years and I feel shame playing pirated version so I have bought it. The original CS is already fun and addictive enough, making me stuck to the computer and play with players overseas and of course with my friends. That's how I think about CS.

However, CZ presented a mission mode which make it differs from the original CS. The official mission pack Tour of Duty is boring to me, really boring. Deleted Scenes is great for its content however. The graphics in CZ have really improved, even I don't like the improvements.

I would still recommend this, as this improved graphics compared to the original CS."
5866,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqCoQd8zbO4
5867,The second installment of Counter-Strike. This one revamed sounds and maps. Otherwise it's the same as the old Counter-Strike. Had lots of fun hours with this game.
5868,Many hours of glitchy fun.
5869,It's like Dota 2 but with less wizards and more Russians.

5872,Players better than 1.6
5873,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero. Pretty awesome single player ""Tour of Duty"" style gameplay. Brings the standard CT Vs. T gameplay into the scene with missions with and against BOTs that also judges your selection of teammates. Not choosing the right ones can cost you a mission, easily.

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero deleted scenes. First person campaign of the counter-strike series. Uhhh...yes please? Pretty awesome game overall. Incorporates the gameplay of CS with a single-player FPS story. Can't ask for much more...well except maybe if it had the graphics and engine of Source/Global Offensive instead of Condition Zero...lol.

"
5874,This game its totally unbelivebel its better by 100% from cs 1.6 better colors better gun skins better sound quality . This game its awesome it worth 7.99 :) .
5875,"Just torrent the game if you want to play singleplayer, it's not worth the money.

They could have made this game in Source engine if they wanted too which sucks because the game was released 6 months before CSS"
5876,aqui esta um jogo que vale apena jogar online.... :)
5877,"CS:CZ is a great game. It is basically just CS 1.6 with better graphics, and some new mechanics. Also, this game has bots, which is nice. It also has this ""Deleted Scenes"" thing, which is basically Call of Duty in the Counter-Strike universe.

It is cool.
That is all."
5878,like!
5879,"I quite enjoy the concept of a single player experience in Counter Strike, and i enjoy Condition Zero. Its not a mind-blowing adaptation to the series, but its fun for people who are looking for a more casual, solitary, Counter Strike experience."
5880,"A really good Counter-Strike game WITH bots, unlike 1.6."
5881,nice game relative good graphics
5882,shit game

5890,buy it now!
5891,you will never go outside again!!!!
5892,Good Game i love it......................................................
5893,"FOR CS_CZ:
One of the biggest MMO FPS games that ever existed on Earth ! I can even say THE BIGGEST ! This game and its predecesors of course affected at least 80% of the pople worldwide, with its awesome gameplay,team work,lone wolf, warcraft3 respawn and many many many many more modifications to this epic FPS game ! This game truly gave the birth to games like CoD and BF,or at least HOW they should have been(now they are simply crap...(except BF bad company 2 and CoD 1 & 2). Game's really great and offers LOADS of maps and community made skins! Love it ever since 1999 (the birth of CS) 



FOR CS_CZ: deleted scenes: 
Everyone that played Counter-Strike had probably wanted to have a single player experience,something different a bit,than just starting every round and killing the opposite team. I sure did :P Well this is it my friends,sneaky beaky like !!! A nice partially stealth,partially all gunz 420 blaze it style action campaign. A true classis ! Would definately recommend it to the 1990- 1998 old school guys out there ! GL and HF soldier !"
5894,"This is the perfect game for offline mode!!!!! The sad thing from this game is that you can only obtain it buying the pack Counter Strike Complete, you cant just go to the store and search for it, apart from that, if you dont play it in offline mode, you can join to a server or you can play with your friends through LAN!! Its missions and challenges are very entertaining!!!!!"
5895,ITs Good Game <3
5896,"It is like an update of Counter-Strike 1.6 with better skins and maps, and you have great missions."
5897,"Even if you are a huge counter strike fan I do not reccommend it. It would have been good if it were to relise back in 2000, But not half life good just graphically and phyisicaly it would be like a next gen preview. However, It did not. everything is soo scripted cod feels like an openworld compared to this. Menu's are bugged and/or bad designed, I have around 6 hours on this and I still don't know how to unlock new missions. Not that I wanna play more but hoping they are better.
If you are in for the single player, don't buy it. Buy CSS or CS 1.6 or CSGO instead."
5898,"A ""single-player"" version of Counter-Strike 1.6 that offers 2 campaigns: Tour of Duty and Deleted Scenes. Deleted Scenes plays more like a conventional single-player FPS while Tour of Duty retains most of the multiplayer experience. It is worth noting that Condition Zero does come with multiplayer matchmaking as well.

Tour of Duty has you play traditional Counter Strike matches on each of the 1.6 maps. To win, you must win at least 3 rounds with a 2 round lead, and complete certain ""challenges"" including stuff like ""Get X kills with [certain weapon]"" and ""Rescue 4 hostages"". Each map you complete gets you a ""reputation point"" that you can use to choose which bots you want on your team. Each has differing stats (Skill, Co-op, and Bravery), and a different preferred weapon. This creates some fun decision making even before entering a match. Do you make a team with only a few strong, but expensive bots? Or do you get a full team of weaker ones? There are also plenty of tradeoff bots with high stats or weapons, but have notable weaknesses. For example: the ""Maverick"" bot is the cheapest one with high skill and high bravery, but he also has low co-op, meaning that he'll generally ignore you and do his own thing. Another example is ""Alex"", who has an AWP, and good skill and co-op, but bad bravery. This means that he will run away from certain situations like 1v1s. While the core that makes 1.6 so beloved is already here, the team-building that Tour of Duty introduces makes this game surprisingly fun for solo play.

Since this runs on CS 1.6, all of the jankiness comes with it. The hostage maps were particularly annoying since you have to somehow get all 4 to follow you back to your spawn without getting stuck on anything for a round win (besides just killing the enemy team, but usually for a map completion one of the challenges will be to rescue 4 total hostages). You also better make sure to buy a defusal kit on defuse maps because your bots won't.

The deleted scenes portion of the game doesn't hold up as well IMO. It plays more like custom Half-Life maps than CS, as you're fighting through linear levels instead of CS matches. There's no overarching story, instead each mission has it's own self-contained ""story"". Story is a strong word though because for the most part it's just an excuse for you to go somewhere exotic and shoot terrorists in the face. Any sense of grounded realism that the regular CS games portray is completely gone here. The premises of these missions feel much more like B movies with all the cheese that entails. People who enjoy those will likely get a kick out of these missions, but others will be disappointed. 

Another note, playing hard mode isn't fun at all in deleted scenes. Due to your limited health and the unnatural reflexes of the bots, it feels more like a memorization game than anything remotely resembling fair. Also making matters worse is that the second mission is a major difficulty spike for no good reason (the next few levels aren't nearly as bad). I'd only recommend picking hard if A: You want to get really good at CS 1.6 (aiming and reflexes), or B: You're a masochist.

If you're interested in playing CS 1.6, but don't want to deal with people who have been playing 1.6 since 2000, or want to play maps that aren't Dust II, then I recommend this game. I would buy it for the Tour of Duty, but not the Deleted Scenes. You can get an arguably better experience just playing custom Half-Life maps (free downloads online or Sven Coop). Both of Condition Zero's offerings aren't too long, but the bundled CS 1.6 should give you a lot of bang for your buck if you're looking for retro CS."
5899,"Better than 1.6, lower than GO, this game is fucking awesome! :)"
5900,Old school?
5901,Great <3
5902,Awesome game! Enjoy Playing!
5903,great game although 1.6 is a lot better then this.
5904,"More Fun than it sounds. Take CS, CS:S and CoD and you get this. Basically Singleplayer CS:S"
5905,"7/10 - Counter Strike is meant to be a multiplayer game, but if you'd like some classic AI shooting-gallery fun give this a whirl.  I personally enjoyed the ""deleted scenes"" more than the simple missions (since the AI became unfairly frustrating)"
5906,"Fun, but Source and GO are much better. I'd recommend sticking to those instead."
5907,boring..
5908,Iz gud
5909,Awesome classic game!

It's a game where I can send my own teammates or go solo (which is misurable)."

5923,":+
"
5924,"this is a great and classic game for players who have a crappy pc when it comes to gaming (like me). when you buy this, you get CS 1.6 (a pc classic) and CS:CZ along with ""the deleted scenes"" (i don't know what those are). believe me, there's a lot of servers to play on and a lot of friendly english-speaking people to interact with, and same with cs 1.6. i definitley reccomend you buy this, as you get 2 games for the price of $10.99 (also the deleted scenes)."
5925,Only playing this because I can't get CS:GO to work.
5926,"First mission, Bot cant go down the stairs 10/10"

5941,The second game in an amazing series that has influenced a ton of FPS games!
5942,It's not bad
5943,played a little its nice
5944,"This really shouldn't be considered a seperate game in the Counter-Strike series. This should be considered an expansion pack for the original game. It upgrades the graphics and adds a few new maps. the graphics are nice, and the maps are awesome, but the real reason you want this is for the single player aspect. It adds a Tour of Duty campaign, which is a collection of offline multiplayer matches with bots. It also adds a single player campaign which simulates real counter-terrorist missions. This is the dream game for people with bad internet. However, considering its age, I'd only reccomend it to hardcore Counter-Strike fans. This is a great game that you should at least check out!"
5945,cs whit story wow!
5946,"this game takes me to my childhood :D 
i love it."

5952,single player is fun
5953,"This game is the successor to the 2000 shooter called Counter-Strike. Now this game was released in 2004 and it came packaged with essentially two games, one being the base game and the other being the deleted content that was created earlier in the development of Condition Zero. Deleted Scenes is basically a Counter-Strike game that focuses on single-player missions loosely tied together. It‚Äôs just like playing Call of Duty or Medal of Honor but in Counter-Strike. The graphics for this game hasn‚Äôt aged well either for both the base game and the deleted scenes. The textures were low res and washed out in some areas. Even back then the graphics didn‚Äôt look good because Half-Life 2 came out not too long later and it looked so much better than this. The music for this game is pretty good though and the gameplay maintaining the routes of the original Counter-Strike. The deleted scenes content is actually pretty damn good to be considered deleted scenes compared to the base game. The base game is just the original Counter-Strike but with bots and more slightly more detail in the environment. Both games are both relatively easy and normal but wait until you get to the sixth tour of duty. OMG is it ever f****** hard! Unlike the previous tour of duties that were relatively easy to get through on normal difficulty this one just spikes the difficulty so high that it will rip your head apart and feed it to you because there are more enemy bots and for some reason they started to have 5x more accuracy and can spot you with eagle eye vision. It‚Äôs just like playing with players that use aim bot and wall hack to some extent because there reaction times on the sixth tour of duty is like 1/10th of a second. If you can get through that last one without cheating on max difficulty than you really deserve a medal. The multiplayer is just like Counter-Strike 1.6 but with slightly better graphics. Now you might be asking is this game worth it? Yes it is so long as you can get it cheap because it‚Äôs neither a good game nor a bad game and is just above the lines of mediocre. The only reason I recommened this game was because of the deleted scenes content. It's acutally quite unique for the series and this is the only game that did it."

5960,Old but Rejuvinates the Childhood Memory!!
5961,"CS:CZ is a Counter-Strike version of Bootcamp from COD. You can play with bots to freshen up your skills before going online. Also, on the single player missions, there are challenges to do for each specific game like rescue a hostage, or kill a # amount of enemies with a certain type of weapon. 9/10, recommend buying this if your new to CS."
5962,this game no have very big graphics cs go 100% play
5963,"Definetely should be there in your libraries.This game is a living legend.
Improved graphics,sounds and maps are excellent.Also easy to find friendly people in online servers.It's pretty enjoying.
Btw there is no need to praise the offline missions' gameplay."
5964,This game gets lots of hate for some reason. I love it when my internet dies or I just want to relax online. I would recomend it to someone who wants to get into cs without being demolished in 1.6
5965,the best game in the world!!!!!
5966,sexsexsex
5967,Best FPS Game ever played. The best thing about this game is that you can play it with your friend vie internet. I wiould recommend every1 to buy this game on steam because it is the hardwork of the developers which should be paid off. Happy Gaming :*
5968,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a follow up to the original Counter-Strike game. This game was released in 2004, so almost eleven years ago. Condition Zero uses the Half-Life engine. 

What we have here is a CS game which includes a single player mission pack. When it comes to playing Counter-Strike, I am more or less a newb at it. This game gave me the perfect opportunity to learn the guns, maps and mission types without the pressure of feeling like you are letting your team down by sucking. The campaign took me about four hours to complete, but this was only on Normal mode, you can go back and replay the missions on a higher difficulty to eventually work your way up to playing online. 

I also found the squad management system to be a nice little feature which isn't seen in other CS games, at the start of each mission, you can choose which squad members to take with you on the mission, each of the team members have their positive and negative stats so you can really get stuck in with min-maxing them. You start out with three members and you work you way up to having a full blown squad of about eight men. 

On each of the missions you also have to complete specific challenges, these can be goals set around killing a certain amount of people, winning the match in less than ninety seconds, rescuing a specific amount of hostages etc etc. This added a little variety of play, especially the challenges where you have to use a certain weapon in order to complete them. This allowed you to learn how to use other guns effectively rather than sticking with your tried and tested Rifle and Deagle. 

While the graphics do not come close to looking like games we have in the current day, the game still does look nice. I wasn't put off by the dated graphics one bit; I guess that just shows how good the Half Life engine actually is!  

The difficulty levels completely rely on how hard you want to make it. I started out on Normal mode just to get to grips with the game as I am newb like that; but you can work all the way up to playing as if you are in a match online and have the brutally hard experience if you want to. Easy mode is complete walk in the park though, enemies can be standing in front of you for about three seconds before they realize they should shoot you, and even then they spray bullets randomly all around you without actually hitting, so I wouldn't recommend you start out on Easy mode. 

Like I said, the campaign took me about four hours to complete, but there are two or three more difficulty levels to try out, and I can see this adding a lot of variety into the game play, so I can easily see the single player alone taking about twelve hours to complete it fully on all difficulties. 

I found no technical issues what so ever while playing, I would assume all the bugs and niggles would of been ironed out years ago.. 

In conclusion I can easily recommend Counter-Strike: Condition Zero for anyone looking to get into the FPS or CS scene, it will easily give you a worthwhile experience, giving you the opportunity to learn all of the CS maps, guns and game modes in a pressure free environment.

5969,"i freaking hate this game

so i buy the vale complete pack ofr steam summer sale and this is the first game i download
i load it up and realise its mainly single player? IN A COUNTER STRIKE GAME? 
thean i play it and it didnt let me use a gun :( (sigh)

pros

-their are none

cons

-buggy
-bad AI
-no story (wich is imparitive to have for a single player game)
-terriable sound effects (guns sound like spoons tapping against each other?)
-no music (at all... ever)
-bad multiplayer (aka its the same freakin thing as the single player)
-exept do sounds NO diffrence between weapons  
-bad graphics
-a criminaly low player population

honetly its sucks
if you want a game that is what this game wanted to be like thean  ''get RedCruible FireStorm''\
(becuas its nothing like this game but its great)"
5970,This is like Counter Strike : Global Offensive for low quailty PC.
5971,"This game is like Counter-Strike with missions.

Only bots in the missions, but if you are trying to play online, real players, sure. Perfect for players to play when their internet connections is down.

And, this is Counter-Strike 1.6, with improved graphics.

Rating: 8/10 (Due to the graphics and the gameplay is awesome.)"
5972,"I would put this game inside of my mouth, and then i would molest it and love it forever keeping it in my basement for 10 years until finally gaben finds it and returns it to the valve habitat in which i will be sent to prison. In prison i will be spending the majority of my time molesting my pillow dreaming that it is actually counter-strike."
5973,"After countless minutes playing this game. I would say Recommend! 





10/0.01 Would review again"
5974,very good game but not as good as other cs games but goes to same category
5975,l
5976,This game has a story to rival those of shitty games like last of us or bioshock infinite. so good wowe purchase this asnd you weill have a whacky ball ill tell ya what woopwer
5977,Dont waste ur time. You are better of buying 1.6 or just fucking off
5978,"good old shooter! if you're a fps gamer, this is a ""must have"""
5979,wow!
5980,"Boring... Just boring, since I'm neither a really dedicated CS gamer, nor am I really good at FPS games, maybe I'm not the right to judge.

The AI is not really good, and sometimes buggy, some enemies didn't even bother shooting at me, while other just hat lightning reflexes. That doesn't matter, because even on Medium the enemies bullets don't really do any damage. The same applies to your bullets, but since you got about 2 seconds time to aim, you can simply do all headshots, which kinda works.

Ammunition is always a problem, which adds some kind of difficulty to the game, since you are forced to engage close combat with sniper rifles and long range combats with shotguns, just keep one mag an a long range weapon and it shouldn't be a problem.

The grafics are like Condition Zero grafics, not fancy nowadays, but better than CS1.6 and are well enough.

The main reason I dislike this game is the complete lack of any story. There were some minor ""plot"" - like parts, where you are told why to go there and kill all those guys, or sometimes sneek past the guards you could easily overwhelm. Another thing is the sometimes really hard to find routes through the level, some pathways are blocked by a locked door, others by invisible walls, and the worst kind are the pathways, which actually are blocked by some kind of fence, which you are supposed to climb over, but you are never given any hint to do that.

All in all it is a training program for CS: Condition Zero and maybe some other counter strike games, but does not really have any motivational aspects for me."
5981,"For some reason I really really like the campaign of Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes. I think it's because every mission takes place in a new environment with different people and everytime the plot seems to include a ton of action-movie tropes. The multiplayer is dead and the singleplayer for the regular game sucks, but I'd still get this game if only for the deleted scenes."

6008,bought in the cs package a while ago.  Great for Garry's mod
6009,"This is my personal favourite Counter Strike game.
I've noticed that a lot of people say that it's too close to 1.6. But hear this out.

PROS:
Better graphics
Bumpmaps
Some more weapons
Singleplayer
Bots
Map remakes (Which I much prefer over the original)
Definitely has the nicest community over all CS games
Mod friendly
Servers not too full

CONS:
Not many servers compared to the other CS games
Goldsrc in 2004

That's it really."
6010,You can make yourself a better reskin from gamebanana for fuck sake
6011,"This is the same game as Counter-Strike, except it includes single-player mode, slight graphical tweaks, and new maps. I mostly play it for the single-player mode, as the effectiveness of the AI makes it for a really fun and engaging experience for a while. Hardly anyone plays the multiplayer (as most players either play 1.6 or Source). But within its lengthy development time, all the developers did significantly was add bots to an already made game. You can't help but feel disappointed, but nevertheless, the game is included with your purchase of 1.6 (which is worth a purchase) and for that, I recommend it.

6/10 - ABOVE AVERAGE"
6012,"Yeah who does not not know about this game?
Only an infant in it's mother's womb perhaps :3
The best online game ever :D
A must play!

6014,<3333
6015,"So it's like CS but with better graphics and single player ""campaign"". I can't call it really campaign,it's just random maps and random matches with bots. Like in multiplayer. Oh it got a multiplayer feature too,but not so many people are playing it since the 2 newer additions CS:S and CS:GO. Though you could give it a try. 8/10"
6016,"BEEN PLAYIN SINCE I WAS 1 YEAR OLD!


did I mention I was born in 2003?"
6017,Enjoyed this game just playing with bots!
6018,"The unwanted, unadored and underappreciated installment of the Counter-Strike franchise. The single player story campaign is decent for it's time but the bot matches with objectives are a woeful and misguided attempt to mimick  multiplayer. The game lacks the purity of 1.6, the innovation of Source and the great facility of Global Offensive's competitive matchmaking and yet there is still a lot to be said for Condition Zero. It is, at its core, Counter-Strike after all. The game is still trundling along in 2015 thanks to some dedicated, and often small, communities.  You will also find a great number of maps which are unique to this version of Counter-Strike."
6019,Good game

6046,"Downvoted only due to the following:

The practice of paying for mods is antithetical to the nature of the modding community; an optional ""DONATION"" button is not (Just like on the Nexus http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/? ). Was a fun game, The fact that Valve is doing this and that Bethesda is endorsing it and they both taking the largest share of the modders' work is American Corporate greed at it's finest.

Take something artistic and done for the love of the subject matter, monetize it, then allow the accountants to define art as widgets, and then creativity is now run by the mercantile class, the middle men, who are ""America Corporates"".

If they had any integrity and decency, any moneys brought in, at the very least, should be 100% donated to charities on behalf off the modding community in conjunction with Valve or Bethesda or whomever. See Gaben, you don't need the cash grab, you can win by getting good press which in the long run would do better for you to show you are not like EA et al."

6067,"I don't know why this never became popular, it is literally 1.6 CS but better looking. This version IS the Original XBOX version of counter strike, just that on xbox it was not called condition zero just Counter Strike and there was no single player campaign only tutorial missions."

6072,"Best Counter Strike ever.
:^)"
6073,One of the best games iI have ever played I love the fact were you can't respawn till next round and how the gameplay is balanced.
6074,"This game is all about the mission and the offline campaign that was created with it, called the ""Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes"". It was way easier than 1.6, headshots and spray kills happens way easier than in 1.6, and whereas some spam points has been removed in the old maps (and in the added CZ maps), it doesn't really change the layout all that much. It's still the same game - just easier, imo. 

I don't recommend it, since the campaign is dull and boring, gameplay answers to 1.6, just easier, as previously mentioned, and lastly, the ""Call of Duty"" offline bot campaign is so boring and repetitive, you might want to just beat expert, never to come back. It's that terrible. 

Buy 1.6 instead if you want the game in it's entirety, because CZ, while Source added some new elements and better graphics, is just a blatant copy with extra features thrown in there, for people who doesn't care."
6075,good game
6076,beat it.
6077,I recommend !
6078,"It's like counter strike 1.6 but with better graphics and a nice storyline!
I like it :D would play more when i have time :P
But still it's a nice game, well made but still it's a failure to me because the game was released when CSS got released :P
But in a other words the game is pretty fun ^^

6083,NICE
6084,no
6085,"Awesome game. Adds to the fantastic gameplay of the original with bots and single-player. The AI of the bots is a bit clunky now and then but it positively contributes significantly to the game. The Tour of Duty missions are just matches with bots with extra challenges. Adds to extra replayability.

8/10 - Pretty Damn Good."
6086,good game
6087,"No matter how many new games i buy, i always end up back at the beginning playing CZ. It may be old, but it doesn't get boring! CZ is my favourite out of all the Counter Strike family, great game!"

6089,Excellent FPS!  Had much good times playing CZ
6090,GO! GO! GO!
6091,"A good multiplayer game. Enjoy to play it with a lot of friends.
Doesn't a new graphic card."
6092,"CZDS is the franchise's first and only take on single-player campaigns, and it turns out pretty well! It's definitely a fresh new take on the game when it came out over ten years ago, and it still is today.

Although most campaigns feels like your usual run and shoot, the pacing is quite balanced with a few puzzle and hostage/defusal/boss shootout battle scenarios insterspread to break the monotony. The maps are also well-made.

A few downsides: the NPC's aiming sometimes feels inhuman, and the game incorporates a few stereotypes which are not to my liking."
6093,not as good as call of duty
6094,its a gud gam
6095,I like this FPS...i recommend to buy it cause is very hard and funny XD
6096,"Amongst couple graphical upgrades, I don't REALLY find a big difference between this one and 1.6. It feels kinda same."
6097,"Huh... I always assumed this game injected some sort of Rainbow Six-ish story into Counter-Strike, if you figured the same then you'd be wrong too! :P ...Instead the game simply leads you through 18 maps of CS each with a set of challenges. In general the challenges are nothing special, on Normal difficulty they keep engagements from seeming too repetitive, while on Expert they can potentially extend your playtime (for better or for worse). The only bummer thing about the difficulty levels is that they are tied to the campaign which you start, not the individual missions, so choose wisely. Unfortunately the game only lets you play as counter-terrorists, including terrorist challenges would have made it feel more complete. In it you get to assemble your own team but choices are shallow, consequenceless, and thus meaningless. The bots aren't impressive by far, but they get the job done. Oddly the game was surprisingly buggy on my Windows XP machine, but it worked perfectly on Windows 8. So that's it, classic counter-strike, against bots, plus challenges. It's a shame they hadn‚Äôt created a narrative to interestingly drive you through the maps, as I mistakenly imagined; or devised a more complicated and meaningful team building and progression system. As it turned out though, I just can't think of any reason to recommend it, other than if you're stuck on a craptop and really, really, need to scratch your classic CS itch."

I'm fine with that because the original idea may have taken this game to a completely different point than it should have. If you look around on YouTube for reviews of this game people kind of crap on it. This is a really good upgrade of Counter-Strike 1.6 with missions and a storymode. The storymode brings some new tools and weapons into the game. Right now the Steam Summer Sale lets you buy 1.6 and CZ for $1.

6138,"It's like Counter Strike and Call of Duty had a baby, except whichever was the mother did dope during the pregnancy.

In other words, it's not very good.

Still, it's not quite horrible. You can still enjoy it. I certaintly am. Just not that much.

It's a mission-by-mission game with overly linear levels. Doesn't sound terrible, does it? Not very Counter-Strikey, but not terrible, either. The real problem is the combat. It does the Counter-Strike thing where your guns are only acccurate for the first shot, but now they do a lot less damage than they did in the original game, making combat a somewhat frustrating ordeal. It takes way too long to kill people, which, in a series about killing people as effeciently as possible, kinda messes with the experience.

Like I said, it's not horrible, but it just isn't Counter-Strike. I'll still reccomend it, because there isn't anything inherently wrong with the game. It just wasn't what I was expecting from a Counter-Strike game."

Gamers who already accomplished Counter-Strike players will find the offline component somewhat novel but not indispensable. It certainly doesn't do enough to compete with today's shooters and the fact that much of the game is already available in another format makes this version seem a bit redundant.

6157,This game ROCKS!!! Great fan of the series!
6158,"I was going to give this a negative review, but I didn't want to feel left out, so I gave it a thumbs up instead."
6159,"In my Opinion, the BEST counter strike in the series, sure graphics dated (of course though, it did come out in 2004) but as any good gamer knows, graphics do not matter, gameplay is what truly matters and on CounterStrike CZ the gun play is as tight and fun as any shooter. spend the 10 bucks and you'll have a lot of fun with this one."

6171,"Counter-Strike Condition Zero is like Counter-Strike except enhanced graphics, new maps, new hostages, new models, and more. Not really that popular, but the fun should still be the same if played in the populated server. This game comes with Counter-Strike so dont be surprised if you have it and never purchased it because it comes with it.

I'd recommend it to try it out anyways, you will have it anyways when purchase so why not try it out.

Also if anyone is curious of the story mode of Counter-Strike, go play Counter-Strike Condition Zero Deleted Scenes, it comes with it. Basically you will have 3 games for 10$, so go try that if you want to see the story mode of it."
6172,Good.
6173,"Good !!!

6197,good game

6206,Nice to play when you are offline
6207,"This one is a little weird but the best way to describe it is that one kid at school that never fit in but you knew something about it that was, unique, diffrent, but in a very good way, its that person you know is going to change the world some how and someway. Their is something distinctly charming about Counter Strike: Condition Zero. I haven't played much of the Deleted scenes yet so i can't tell you about it. It is much diffrent than the other Counter Strikes. The weapons look much diffrent (I love the new[well old] look of them). It has a single player which offers you diffrent challenges to complete throughout all of the maps. Its surprisingly fun to do when you get into it and didn't take me that long (considering my play time)."

6221,Ebola in fps form
6222,Counter Strike: Condition Zero is a great game. For a game that was released on the GoldSrc engine the graphics are not that bad. Don't get me wrong they are still outdated but they were pretty impressive for its time. This game has basiclly everything the original Counter Strike had and much more. For starters there is the tour of duty mode which is a singeplayer campaign (NO STORY) where you go around famous counter strike map and have to complete objects such as defuse a bomb or rescue hostages. You will also be given mini challenges to complete in that mission (Challenges change depending on what difficulty you select) Along with that you can also download extra 3rd Party Campaigns made by players around the world. Now we move on to Counter Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes and this is actually a seperate game that games with the base game and CS: CZDS is also a singleplayer campaign mode but unlike the tour of duty campaign mode this is actually more of a missions because your not playing clasic counter strike game modes but are rather faced with what appears to be Half-Life singleplayer with counter strike elements. And unlike classic counter strike you can't buys weapons instead you have to find and pick up weapons as you go alone and while it may stray far from the classic Counter Strike Formula you will find that it still actually feels like a actualy counter strike game while at the same time give a quite refreshing start to the game. In the end I would reccomend CS: CZ to old CS fans and even new comers as this is a great game and still has a large community to this day.
6223,You have no friends? You have a bad pc? You are are socially awkward? Then this game is just for you!!!
6224,"So I played CS:CZ Deleted Scenes, played on medium, fukin hell, please don't play it, don't waste your rage, rage somewhere else ;D. P.S. the regular version of CS:CZ is great.

Update:
I just remembered this game. And when i think about it, it is not that bad of a game. Everyone should try it if a person likes this kind of games."

6241,"The overall game is great. After completeing the deleted scenes, it is a very well made game for its age. Just a shame they didnt implement something like the deleted scenes into CSGO. But 8/10 for the base game and DS."
6242,"Campaign mode of Counter Strike with some new weapon textures,new weapon sounds,and tools (blowtorch,infrared cam,etc).Worth playing if you like Counter Strike."
6243,"Even though finding good servers might be a chalange, there is a fun tour of duty mode in single player that can be frustraiting at times, but is overall very fun, and the deleted scenes is a great twist, mixing counter strike with a campaign, which I still don't get why they don't do that anymore!"
6244,nice game
6245,"It is a fun game, once you get past the learning curve. It's very steep. The skins are awesome too, I just wish I had the money to buy them all!"

6288,"CS:CZ... the forgotten middle brother of a successful family. 
It is an evolution of the great 1.6, but the changes are so small that there was no reason to change from one to another, nevertheless is a pretty good game. 
Even in the rough moments when your internet is down, CZ will be there to support you.

10/10 - giving the love that it needs

Spetsnaz sasha is out, peace."
6289,"Though there is barely anyone playing Counter Strike: Condition Zero in comparison to CSGO and CSS, this game was a lot of fun. The ‚Äúcampaign‚Äù is different from all the other Counter Strikes and makes it interesting aspect to try.

6295,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero brings it back to the old days when 1.6 was around. CS:CZ was just another copy of 1.6 but with new animations, and just better graphics.

6296,"I believe this is a good game. Not a great game. Just.... a good game. The campaign? Fun. The online multiplayer? Entertaining. But there are just so many problems with the game itself. Overall- good game, but not really worth the money."

6307,"First,thank you for reading this review.let's Start The Review.

Back to 2010,when I still don't know steam,I was playing this CS:CZ Everytime.Like The Tour Of Dutys,and Awesome maps(Some of The Maps in CS,CS:CZ,And CS:S has not been released in CS:GO).I love the Game.When I found this,I was thinking:WHY THIS AWESOME GAME IS PAID FOR RP 89,999?(In $ = 10 Bucks).when I get some money,I buy this,for Recover my Old Days When I Play This.

Visual/Grafics:10/10
I like The Gaming Grafic.when I play CS:GO,The Visual is not suitable for me.Still better CS:CZ Visual then CS:GO.

Single Player :10/10
Hohohohoho,don't give me shit,I abseloutly like The Fucking Tour Of Duty.It's CS with Better Grapics and Single player mode.

Multiplayer :8/10
Back In My Time,I Play the Single Player,But When I Play the""Find Server"",Nothing Happend.In Fact,NO SERVERS IN THERE,Then,I thinking this:""Is The Community dead?"".NOW,when I play,there were so Many Server,BUT,you will never/sometime see the real player.Also,Server Traps in ther.ex:the map is de_inferno,when I get in,de_dust2.

Deleted Scene:7/10
Still Better Tour Of Duty Than CS:CZDS.

Overall:9/10
I Like This Game,but I hat The Servers,almost goddamn no. One playing.I want this community back playing CS:CZ.

STILL BETTER THAN CS:GO"
6308,awesome
6309,i definately recommend this game.....
6310,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was and still is the best FPS for me. To me, it is better than COD and far more entertaining (as you can see in my hours spent in it). It has many servers which have many active players still (to this day) and their servers contain the default gamemode + many different modded versions such as zombies and whatnot. It is pretty similar to CS 1.6 but features improved graphics, a campaign and bots in Singleplayer. You will not regret buying this game. Do not judge it by its graphics but instead by its gameplay. Remember, if you don't like the default gameplay there are still MANY modded servers for you to play on! Also, it doesn't have a case opening simulator so you don't have to worry about wasting your money on gun designs and people judging you by which gun designs you have.

Score: 10/10"
6311,Still better than CS:GO............
6312,"Same as the timeless original, but with better graphics. Plus, it's always nice to play with bots as well add custom single player campaigns :)

Additionally, Deleted Scenes is worth checking out. Really enjoyed the single-player experience in a CS game!"
6313,this is hack xD
6314,"nice game :)
"
6315,"Too hard. if u r pro, play this game, but even easy is hard! once you get shot once, you're probably already dead"
6316,"I remember back in 2010 when I got my first true gaming platform (computer-wise) my friend gifted me this game and I played it on and off for it was the only first few games I had on Steam since I was new to the community. This game is fun and although I won't play it anymore since I have Counter-Strike Source this game was a part of me involving myself into the Steam community and becoming a Steam user.

Great game to shoot and kill people and great with many mini-games that the community has made up. If I was you though, I'd buy Global Offensive (I haven't bought it, I still have Source) because within this review the playerbase has that has logged into this game in the past 24 hours has been 1316 people and for Global Offensive it has been 292,836 people in the past 24 hours.

Counter Strike Condition Zero playerbase: http://steamcharts.com/app/80 (lowest)
Counter Strike: Source playerbase: http://steamcharts.com/app/240 (mid)
Counter Strike Global Offensive playerbase: http://steamcharts.com/app/730 (highest)"

6327,"Still a nicely game, but theres not enough mods to play, and almost all server ive been playing this game awp is blocked, that aint a good signal, you can practice with bots if u want and missions to do, i vote YES."
6328,I remember the long old days when we all used to LAN this game. WASD was the KB of choice in those days...
6329,good game all around. for some reason i  had bugs that i couldent fix such as voice chat and store options not showing up. it could be my mac but im not sure. despite those major bugs i really enjoyed this game. (just watch out for the a-hole teams mates that stab you.)
6330,this game is so old
6331,superb game (Y)
6332,"A bit different from CS 1.6, but it's really nice with the singleplayer mode."
6333,"Played countless hours of offline mode when i was a kid. Never got old and it still isnt, definately a worthwhile purchase.

Easily one of the best games ive ever played."
6334,It's fun to play a campaign version of CS.
6335,Like on Old Times :) Boom Headshoot and GG
6336,CS:CZ is a fast paced fun action game. It can be played offline and online. It's a good way to learn CS.

6340,bra ja:D
6341,juz loved it
6342,"Counter Strike: Condition Zero comes with two games:
1. Condition Zero
2. Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes

1. Condition Zero
Basically Counter Strike 1.6 but with improved graphics and the addition of bots. The bots are amazing considering when this game was released (they're still inferior to human players). In addition, the bots are a great way for beginners to learn about the game in a more relaxed environment. There is also a singleplayer Tour of Duty, which is basically regular counter strike missions against bots, but with additional challenges (example: kill 3 enemies with a sniper rifle). Sadly, the Tour of Duty missions are Counter-Terrorist only. There are no Terrorist missions.

2. Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes
This is a singleplayer game. It uses the same weapons and game mechanics as Condition Zero, but with some additions, including the awsome fiber optic camera. Level design is one of Deleted Scenes' greatest strengths. The AI is passable. The story is where it fails, in that each mission is its own self-contained story with practically no connecting elements. I suspect you don't even play as the same person in each mission. Immersion takes a serious hit because of this. It helps to pretend you are playing as the same person. I recommend Adrian Shephard before Black Mesa.

I had a lot of fun playing Condition Zero and Deleted Scenes. I highly recommend these games as well as any other Counter Strike game (or any game by Valve for that matter). By the way, check out the first screenshot on the store page. Really take a close look at the plane..."
6343,old school and still fun to play with.
6344,"The reason I bought this was for Deleted Scenes. CZ Deleted Scenes are in deep need of polishing for todays standards, but give it a break it was probably made before you were born. Deleted Scenes has very good cutscenes that catch you up and are a great part of the game. Once again, the AI needs polishing for todays standards, but the enviroment still does its job even to today by giving you a slight unsettling feeling as you battle enemies. Deleted Scenes campaign is SINGLEPLAYER so you can play Counter-Strike offline, which is cool as hell in my opinion. Counter-Strike campaign offline. However, just like every other CS game you probably need experience with the FPS genre. Don't let easy mode fool you because it is really tough. Any CS fan will love CZ."
6345,great game 100/10
6346,What could I possibly say about this game. It's too fantastic for our world. Condition Zero? More like Condition My Hero because this game is possibly the best game ever made.
6347,Cool revamped classical version of this game!
6348,"CS:CZ is a game about shooting terrorists and policemans from secret organisations (Not anymore). The game is very good, everyone will tell you that, there is a campaing to do and you can play with bots on 4 difficults. THE BEST GAME EVER!"
6349,"Less popular than 1.6 but just as good. It`s 1.6 with campaign.

8/10"
6350,"They killed Kenny!

Kenny is best bot.

This game is like a campaign mode for counter-strike."
6351,"SUPER FUN!!! I extreamly enjoy this, must get 10\10 or play if you already have and not sure if you wanna play it xD"
6352,Bla bla bla bla bla..

6355,"Started to play Counter-Strike lightly at age of 7-8, and became stuck with CZ when I turned 10 where I played it with friends for hours and hours, but then 1.6 became the main thing and CZ became a shadow of 1.6 which is quite sad but CZ is always fun, no matter if it's 2014 or 2004, play it with your friends and have an amazing time with each other! :)"

CS just like 1.6 but... with small map changes and... same shit all over again...
EXCEPT: great awesome singleplayer campaign
These 80 hours i played this game was 95% spent on single player campaign, which gives unique experience of small missions besides the match. There are 18 maps to play on those campaign (classics like dusts or aztec but also forgotten maps like chateau). Games are pretty much about getting better score, just like in any other CS with some changes:
- Teammates Selection - Before the match starts, you get an option to choose up to 5 teammates. Each teammate costs points, which you get for winning the maps. Each bot is prefering different weapon, has different skill level, differently play as team, different bravery. So if you are playing map like aztec, you should get some snipers and on office get some guys with higher teamplay skills.
- Mini-Objectives - While you play the match, you have usually 3 main mini-missions to finish during the match. Easier ones are like to get few kills with specific weapon, harder are to kill flash-blinded enemy. Sometimes you will have to kill two guys with pistol and survive the round, one of the hardest is even to kill an enemy with knife. To win the match, you have to finish all those objectives and be 2 wins ahead of terrorists. However, if you let them be 2 wins ahead, you loose and you can start all objectives over.

Campaign is only playable as Counter-Terrorists, but there are a lot of downloadable campaigns, you can even easily make your own with your own bots and custom maps.

+++ Single Player Campaign - you wont find anything like this in any other CS
+- Its pretty old game, so graphics is just fine.
- Forget multiplayer, i guess its not alive in this game

6376,"This was my very first Steam game. I never liked first-person shooters until this game. Call of Duty was unheard of. This is where it was at for first-person shooters and player vs. player. Simplistic in play, I have put in many hours playing this game. I know there are newer Counter-Strike games out now, but coming back to play this game takes me back. The offline mode was a good place to practice, because I would get owned big time online with real players. People had a lot of free time to play this game and time to get really good. After a while I got the hang of it and became pretty good online. I wasn't the best, because there was always someone better. Using a headset was new to me. It really made things a lot better and I only bought a headset for this game but it was worth it. If you like this game, Counter-Strike: Source has better graphics and gameplay, but this game will run pretty decent on slower computers. I don't like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I have a gaming computer but for some reason my graphics card doesn't like the game anyway."

  This game have perfect Singleplayer gameplay,and it is with mission you gotta actually complete it.If you skilled with CS 1.6 or 1.5,The same skills applied on this game too.If you dont have friends to play CS 1.6 or 1.5,then this game is for you.

6393,rly fun 4 real get so amaze
6394,The only Counter-Strike I don't enjoy. It's basically CS 1.6 with an exceptionally boring singleplayer.
6395,..
6396,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is the first official sequel to mod Counter-Strike, released in retail in 2004. It was pretty much same Counter-Strike on same engine and minimal changes when it comes to multiplayer experience, but it had more to often to solo players, with addition of bots and ""Deleted Scenes"" pack of single-player missions.

Now, for multiplayer community... Is as good as ever. While it's not on the level of Counter-Strike 1.6, you will still be able to find few almost-full servers, whetever it's yet another De_Dust2 map or some server that actually rotates maps. Just more smaller tighter community. BUT it's kinda way too high-skilled by now for newbies to be able to enter in easily.

So, when it comes to the main, expected, multiplayer part of the game, it didn't recieve many changes. Explosive grenades are stronger. Hostages are a bit more realistical. The end.
Oh, and you will ntoice that graphics got a small boost, as far as HL1 engine goes (""GldSrc""). Models got more detail to them. Few tweaks here and there. Maps are much interesting as far as graphical design goes. If you are going to play de_dust2 non-stop then better do it at the less bland one.
And yes, I don't really like Counter-Strike realistical gameplay much here either.

Now, for single-player, you finally get some bots to play with. Which are less frustating for new people than online play and helps to hone aiming skills as well better. Though, while they navigate through default maps quite nicely, they don't always make best decision. As a protip, always send them a voice command to stick together, team. They also try not to steal your fun of defusing bomb, waiting for commander to do it, even if said commander is in opposite end of map. Yes, it's a flaw.
And like Quake 3 Arena and UT, CZ single player consist of repeated matches with bots, as you will progress through trio of maps, being able to pick less and less stupid teammates over time, always being on side of Counter-Terrorists. And on each map, you have to have more than 2 wins over score of Terrorist team and have to complete each of three objectives, which go like ""rescue <x> hostages"", ""kill <x> amount of Terrorists yourself"", ""finish some round in <x> time"" and ""kill <x> terrorists with <y> weapon"".  So, fun for a while, but more of ""just so something was there"".

And now for Deleted Scenes. This is what Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was supposed to be at some point, a full-blown single-player campaign. It was ""cancelled"" once Valve saw magazines giving it low ratings to preview, just to have it put along as bonus into final game. All just to get low ratings once again due to being ""more of same"". Deleted Scenes had 12 missions in retail release, with Steam version adding 6 more that you can select anytime from World Map.

Now, Deleted Scene is a mix of good and bad. The excellent level design and repetive core gameplay.
First, good things. Level design is quite good one. You will have to take control of unnamed heroes of counter-terrorist operations all over the world, with missions having great variety, with enough lenght to keep you playing, having to stop terrorists from taking over nuke in snowy part of Russia, defending yourself in Arabain town or fighting your way through the jungles. Seriously, some of the missions just have a bit of that scripted hollywood love that would make them worthy of being in Call of Duty and alikes, quite epic! Levels themselves are also build with knowledge of pacing and a bit of exploration, albeit linear.
And it really tries to push GldSrc engine! In order to make it look like it's capable of more than expected, developers made a lot of animations of death for terrorists as well as destruction animations. Hell, I was amazed to see a stack of boxes getting squeezed by a door in the third mission, it's all quite joy to look at even if it's scripted. And well, it does hurt occasionally when it comes to enemies deaths. Like, when you shot with pistol at melee enemy into knee and he suddenly teleported half-meter away to the door, swirled and fell toward the door, just to get it open.

But core gameplay of Counter-Strike doesn't translate well at all into linear levels of single-player. What you bassicly will do, is to shoot few bullets into heads, while taking some hitscan bullets back. Repeat it on every enemy. Until the end of the game. It really is repetive and boring. Weapons don't matter much, all of them are good enough for bursting enemy again and again. Grenades aren't given often and flashbang don't seem to be as useful as in multiplayer. Smoke grenade is more offensive there though, making enemies cough instead sometimes. There is little enemy variety as well, you just got whatever hitscan stupid enemy, stationary snipers with laser, whatever melee enemy that rushes you and terrorist with freaking bazooka that is pain to avoid too! So, burst headshot, and burst headshot, repeat repeat repeat.
It also finally get to have some music there. For once. So, something definitely good.

Counter-Strike Condition Zero is better offer than Counter-Strike 1.6 and has more value for solo players, but it's still not good enough to get me much interested in such twitchy realistical shooter. I still wouldn't recommend new people, especially with newer CS titles out there, only those who already play Counter-Strike should check out this one."
6397,"I got this with the valve complete pack.Thought it was kinda cool but got bored after a few hours.Then i was like""Hey,why dont i see what the deleted scenes are like,and what i got i did not expect,i was expecting condition zero with more maps and like a few ""experimental weapons"".What i got was a counter strike with a campaighn.It felt weird playing as it was counter strike but it ""wasnt counterstrike ""if you know what i mean.The deleted scenes are awesome absolutely love them.Definently recomend."
6398,"By far the BEST counter-strike ever made.
AI is superior to any other game of the time period.
Hostage AI is just something amazing!
Excellent new maps with good layots.
Game itself works extremely well and smoothly compared to any other CS title.
Singleplayer is very athmospheric and fun to play. It is done with different engine than the multiplayer thou.

6399,"Interesting Guns and Features on this game. I would recommend to anybody who likes FPS and Shooting/Action games. To the Single Player combat with terrosists and criminals, to the multiplayer, so you can test your friends (or enemies) skills. This game is to be almost realistic with actual Special Ops. Don't miss out on an amazing action packed world, with guns,skills, and chills!"
6400,Idk what this is.
6401,yessss :)
6402,"I bought this game on sale, because i wanted to have the full CS collection, but what a great surprise i got when i actually played it. Its CS with a campaign mode or Tour of Duty, whatever you wanna call it.
If you want a challenging single-player mode with different difficulties and maps, then this game has what you want but expect some bugs and the AI isnt great but gets the job done and its challenging enough for a good time.

The Deleted Scenes game only adds more content to CZ with new missions all over the world where you play as different units with a story behind each mission and a lot of objectives to follow. The game isnt recent but you can still have fun with it in 2014, at least, in my opinion.

I totally recommend if you wanna have some single-player fun.

6424,||||o)
6425,"I bought 1.6 and I noticed ""Condition Zero"" and ""Condition Zero Deleted Scenes"" popped up in my library.  That's a plus, it comes for free with the original counter-strike.

Condition Zero is amazing.  It's the Counter-Strike gameplay we all expect, but with a teambuilding menu and a campaign that bears similarities to Unreal Tournament 2004.  Across all the different maps, you'll be fighting the terrorists with your co-op bots, all of which have custom statistics, weapons and stats for Skill, Bravery, and Co-op.  The AI is competent and even unforgiving, minus the annoying standoffs between T's and a riot shielding bot, and the game remains a lot of fun as you have a 'tour' of each map with multiple side-objectives and a round counter.  If you can win three rounds and be ahead by two, and complete your objectives, you move onto the next round.  Trying to balance out easy victories versus, say, completing a round in 75 seconds or getting three tactical shield kills, is surprisingly difficult at times and gives the game a lot of replay value as each difficulty has a new set of objectives (don't even bother with Expert).

Now, let's talk about CZ Deleted Scenes.  I've always wondered if Valve ever considered making a Half-Life style campaign for Counter-Strike.  It seems like such an excellent idea... and this seems to be a direct message to me saying ""Been there, Done that.""  That's right, this is a campaign, complete with events and mission-specific objectives.  In Counter-Strike.  That's where the praise ends, becuase Deleted Scenes is atrocious.  Don't get your hopes up like I did, it's one big steaming turd of broken hitboxes, amazingly horrible voice acting, and OCCASIONALLY showing a small amount of promise as a good game before more turds go into the fan.
--
These two games along with 1.6 knock GO out of the park.  If you want a Counter-Strike game for both online and offline, look no further than the CS 1.6 + CZ bundle.  Probably some of the greatest $10 you'll ever spend.  Also, there's no chance of an MP shutdown, since Valve holds the servers up with Steamworks to this day-- not that it would shut down, 1.6 is 20,000 concurrent players strong at all times.

EDIT: Okay, maybe [strike]30,000[/strike] 50,000 people... not bad for a game from the 90's."

6438,"Regarding CS CZ DELETED SCENES. A very solid mod. Offers great missions, voices and sounds are great. Mission crossover with normal CS maps. Realistic accuracy and gun control, not the reatrded shit show from normal CS where it feelsl like everyone is shooting drunk. Challenging gameplay with good mechanics and a few new things added. Highly recomend to any halflife player, aspecially to CS players to get the feel how CS really should have been.

Finally after the beating the stock campaign matches on all difficulties and having played some online, the game is fairly simple and similar to original CS, just more polished. Good game overall, but not for my taste. Luck in this game has a bigger role than skill, and a game mechanic like that is unappealing to selfaware FPS gamer. I can beat UT2004 on Godlike, yet this is almost impossible for me. A good game, but not my game."

P.S. MUIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
"
6443,"As dated as this game may be, compared to Global Offensive. Condition Zero is a mainly singleplayer focused Counter Strike title oddly enough. Which its the very old unreal style campaign, not the story driven one we now see in a regualr shooter. So; is it as fun as newer Counter Strike titles? Yes, maybe even a bit more. Has it aged well? No. It a very love hate relationship between me and the campaign style here. I like the ai team mate selection gimmick, allowing you to choose better, people to be with assuming you have the right points to buy them before the match begins. The stat's on them which are skill, co-op, and bravery actually matter and can have very noticable effects on how they move around the map. Me, I personally think Travis, the riot shield weilding badass of 300 confirmed kills is someone that is a required team mate. Where as one may go with Pete someone who as balanced stats across the board, but only has a smg. There is actually a pretty good amount of tactical feel to this, as many times I was stuck on a level I could switch out team mates and DESTROY. BUt this campaign style is a little.......... frustrating? In each match there are a certain preset requirements for you to complete. These are the BAIN OF COUNTER STRIKE, as some on the expert difficulty are masochistically made. Kill and enemy with a knife and survive the round? Fuck no. Besides that, I recommend this game. Also shotguns are much better in source."

6451,Very satisfying campaign. Also found a server online with a lot of people still in it. Only wish it had more campaign or more people modding it.
6452,It's alright.
6453,"One of the worst FPS games I've ever played. Weapons feel terrible and behave very differently compared to the multi-player versions of those exact same weapons. AI is horrible. Visuals are decent for a game running on top of the goldsrc engine but at the same time visuals are not very optimised causing slowdowns now and then. Sounds and music are low quality stuff. Voice acting is ridiculously bad. There are plenty of issues to talk about. But all this is mostly forgivable stuff.

Why you might ask? It's because of the mess that is the development history of this game. It was originally conceived in 2000. It was announced in 2001 at E3. However the studio that started the development, Rogue Entertainment, went defunct later that year. The development was then handed over to Gearbox Software but they were not allowed to complete this game after missing out the 2002 deadline. Then the bits and pieces were sticked together in a rush by Ritual Entertainment in 2003 but that work was for naught. It's a miracle that CS:CZ was even released at all. The fourth studio to work with this game, the newly founded Turtle Rock Studios, abandoned the whole single-player campaign to make their own thing. CS:CZ was eventually released in 2004 as a multi-player focused training game with bots.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=311274615

CS:CZ:DS offers a curious peek into the future of what could have been. More refined version of CS:CZ:DS is what the grand single-player Counter-Strike game should have been. Instead we got a campaign about series of matches against bots with challenges in CS:CZ. That's all fine and dandy but that isn't very interesting. What's interesting about CS:CZ:DS is that here we have a game, that's more of a precursor to Call of Duty, and a game that has a lot in common with the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare games, and other ""Modern Military Shooters"" in-general.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=311286905

CS:CZ:DS is a long pipe FPS, that features series of disconnected missions, extremely heavy scripting, NPC interaction similar to the Call of Duty, similarly boring repetitive gunplay, vehicle battles against Hind helicopter, explosions, terrorists launching nukes from old Soviet missile silos, and all the other stuff except the high quality craftsmanship that goes into the Call of Duty games.

I bought the game when it was originally released in 2004 and it was pretty bad even then. I just installed CS:CZ to replay it since it was release for Linux in 2013 and I'm mostly spending my time in Linux thesedays. The CS:CZ:DS can be an interesting precursor for the modern military shooters if you're interested in playing that kind of stuff but in-generally people should avoid this game for what it is. It's an unfinished single-player Counter-Strike game that features normal Counter-Strike multi-player mode with slightly updated graphics and bots.

If you check the Wikipedia and Wikia articles of CS:CZ, you will find out loong story of the development of the game; it was a disaster... Valve ordered the game to Rogue Entertainment in 2000, however the departure of the producer of the studio to Sony led the company defunct. After that failed startup, Valve gave the project to Gearbox Software which made a remarkable progress however failed to meet the deadline. Therefore, pissed Valve took the project from them and gave it to Ritual Entertainment. The ""clever"" people in Ritual decided to remake the game instead of developing well designed job of Gearbox. Then, ta taaaa; the gold version the game was boring, dull, unpolished and even clunky. The critiques were so bad that Valve decided to pull the game back and ask Turtle Rock Studios to complete the job. Turtle Rock restarted the work of Gearbox and completed the game that we have now as CS:CZ which is quite nice. But how about ""Deleted Scenes""? Well, that single player game was released as a free addon to actual CS:CZ with the name of Deleted Scenes.

Yeah, that was the story of the development. But, is it worth to play Deleted Scenes? Not at all!

All 19 missions are totally uninspired and dull. The game shamelessly respawns enemies to the locations that you have already cleared. Worst, you killed a guy in the corner, you want to take that corner as a cover, right? Na na na na naaa; a new enemy is likely to be respawned right back of you. The developers did not even bother to respawn those enemies to a fairly distant location. If you are annoyed with the instant back spawning of Arch-Vile in Doom 3, you will be pissed in this game which is not even a fantastic horror FPS...

Deleted Scenes has one of the most linear level progress ever; it can even compete nowaday's modern shooters such as COD in the case of linear level progress... I can understand the need for linearity in order to have scripted events which are pretty much the curse of nowadays' shooters. However, the game does not let you backtrack most of the times. It is not like ""hey, you fell down from that roof which is not reachable right now"" scenario; you pass a door and after a short loading, that door is now cannot be openned in the very same level! You are simply caged between the loading points. I do not play nowadays' noob shooters, thus I have few information about their level progress but that does sound even foolish for those games. Gold key seeking in the mazes of Doom 1 is way more innovative even for ""today""...

Conclusion;

I cannot say ""do not buy"" Deleted Scenes; it is bundles with Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Condition Zero. But I can easily say that do not bother to play that game. If you are too bored and looking for something to kill you time, grab one of the F2P games... The only reason that I played and even finished all the levels of this game is my current computer is so crappy that it can handle very few games; that is one of them. That is it...

Peace..."
6472,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a first-person shooter game from Valve. It is the next installment of the Counter-Strike series. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is basically a slightly improved version of the original Counter-Strike, but with many addition to the game, it can also be considered as standalone expansion pack.

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero gameplay is 100% the same with original Counter-Strike. But Counter-Strike: Condition Zero has new Tour of Duty mode, more maps and the new singleplayer campaign named Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. Tour of Duty is a singleplayer mode game that is basically has the same game mode, but has some challenges objective that needs to be completed to win the map. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero also introduce offline multiplayer bots, where you can play against AI controlled player in offline game.

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero graphics is also basically the same as Counter-Strike, only has some improved models, textures and maps, but older maps are still included in the game.

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a good improvements to Counter-Strike. I recommend this.

6484,"Excellent training game for geniune Counter-Strike matches or for harder bot matches. Towards the end of the mission pack, however, it seems to get a bit unfair with the bot skill. Then again, Counter-Strike is a game of reflexes and quick-thinking, so I suppose it's a bit of tough love.

Recommendation(s): Be a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, understand the old 1.6 mechanics, and play a little bit of Half-Life.
Major Theme: Hidden treasure for CS players.
Bought at Price: $100 (for Valve Complete Pack)

Single player Counter-Strike was always an interesting concept to throw around. So much in fact, a small studio completed it.

A quick reminder, this game was designed around Half Life. Linear gameplay in a compact space should be expected. This doesn't mean its bad - plenty of single player games are linear - it just takes time to understand if you haven't played Half Life. Level layouts and item interaction are not going to be what you are used to. Is the game perfect? No, and no game is. Due to the for mentioned old game design theories, certain pathways and mechanics will seem odd. Getting players to do a 180, and come back the way they came can be confusing.

I've always been a Counter-Strike fan. There's no denying that. If you are well, you will have a blast with this title (and the Deleted Scenes). This title brings you back to the roots of CS, which allows for a neat experience. Would you play it again and again because of that? Probably not, because I completed the game in 4 hours and that felt like it was enough. I can only really see someone playing this if they are using an old machine with poor internet connection.

Being an old engine, AI isn't very good either. The way around that is to place environmental hazards everywhere such as trip mines. Because of this, it feels more like Half Life then Counter-Strike.

To wrap this up, if you are a CS player, you are missing something by not playing this. If you aren't, go on in life, there's nothing demanding here for you to play."

6494,"Good game, always been - always is. But thanks to some different minded, some would call them special, the game is a nest of malware, trojans, viruses... just named it. My PC and anti virus program saw already judgement day if it wasn't for a top customer service of a very reliable protection software.
I'm actualkly way more disapointed in Steam or/and Valve because you let this sort of **** onto your list/servers and people buy legit things and get screwd up. Wasn't the first time i had this kind of experience, but definately the worst.
Go and sort out your security so customers of your services won't end up with infested pc/ laptops."

6498,"Overall, the game with objectives and missions that missing in original one, here you will feel a different side of typical Counter-Strike online battles.

6516,"i appreciate all the hard work to get some story into the CS franchise. On the other hand i cannot appreciate the severe lack of optimization of the particle effects, which cause framerate drops from stable 70 to unplayable 10FPS. This becomes a really big hurdle when trying to clutch through the final stages of a mission with low HP, adding unneccesary frustration to an otherwise interesting project."

6533,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE DELETED SCENES

If you want to buy a good single player shooter then do NOT  buy this. The weapons handle like they do in the normal Counter Strike but the AI is shit and overall too easy. The missions' design is mediocre as well as the overall gameplay. You'd be better off with getting Counter Strike 1.6 or the newer ones like Source or Global Offensive.

3/10 would not recommend."

6545,It's nice =)))
6546,"Sadly dead.

Out of all the Counter-Strike games, this one is probably the most underrated. However, that doesn't make it a bad game in anyway.

For one thing, CZ doesn't deliver anything really new into Counter-Strike compared to 1.6.

There are a few things they did add.

+A Campaign Mode
+Re-decorated maps
+New Maps
+A Mission Mode
+New sound effects
+Slightly beter graphics

And when you compare 1.6 to CZ, they're nearly IDENTICAL.

I would only get this for the Campaign and the Mission Mode. For Core Multiplayer CS gameplay, get 1.6. However, if you want to try out the Deleted Scenes campaign, this is worth your time."
6547,very great game of its time and still one of the greatest fps out there today

6562,not as good as 1.6
6563,"Though the game is outdated, its pretty damn good.  The first 3 hours of failing were rough and i gave up on it for like a month....the singleplayer and harsh community helped me improve and though I'll never be as pro as them, you'll find the fun. The community is rather small being dated but is fun, nice, and absolutly crazy. Beats any other modern gaming community i know. The core gameplay still works awesomely. And nothing is better than pure chaos in  16 v 16 fight. I'll  eventually switch to   CSGO when I get a better hardware but if the community is still there I wont mind hoppin on in the future. It's worth the buy if your willing to commit yourself to the learning curve, but don't expect much. This is a true example  of how older games got it right and continues to worl with it. Graphics are'nt everything. That said I should probably due the same for CS 1.6. It's great if your willing to commit with little expectations but not if your all graphics and a big community and constant new things. Its really the community that won me :) See ya!!!"

6644,"The online is pretty barren at this point. The servers that are up are mostly outside the US or running mods that probably suck. 

But there are some reasons this maybe the last real ""Counter Strike"" game as the later ones went to Source and the problems relative to that. Aswell as far reaching but in reality small changes made in CSGO and CSS that really make it very very diffrent than the older games when in play.

Graphically CS and CS:CZ are pleasant looking, simplistic, whats good for a competative shooter game. Its easy to see enemies. Models look pleasant, and its still has some really great 3D sound effects.

Suffice to say if this game had slightly better controls, matchmacking or was updated to have these features it would probably be alot more lively than it is today. Or even add those features for standard CS. I would rebuy or pay extra for that.

CS:CZ and CS come together if you buy them and they would make a terrific LAN game.

If you want something to play single player all you will get from here is Bot Matches (Bots are really good for a multiplayer game in CZ and better than CSGO bots). CZ Deleted scenes is included but this is basically an unfinished old game thats just not good at all but really had some capability to be pretty good but unfortunately they didn't further its development so its crap.

If you want a multiplayer game for online play with random people around the globe, CS or CSGO would be a better choice since both of those seperately have way more players than this game.

6677,"Deleted Scenes Review:

This game is one of those , which solves biggest dilemma of Counter-Strike : AK,M4,AWP or P90. Well ,it says ""Decoy u 2"" and allows to carry everything at the same moment, so you will be allowed not to snipe from range of 10 kilometres with your trustful MAC-10. Plus, you can say ""Screw you camper, Imma bazooka the 300 dollars out of you"". If that is not convincing enough, in Latvia you can see dude which plays Condition Zero, when you are playing Condition Zero(Counter-Strike C4-blow). This game is real pain ,like whole P90 team, if you don't like to be Sneaky Beaky Like ...

Condition Zero Review:

So buying this game actually give you 2 games, which is diffrent like Vertigo and Dust II. When Deleted Scenes was solo #YOLO, Condition Zero is multiplayer one, which is not as good as original 1.6 as few of you think. But I think it's opposite. This game shows best camping skills of bots http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=141869292 ,just like in CSGO Casual. But their camping skills ain't the best feature of this game. You can tell that Condition Zero made a step foward with most knew voice line of bots ""I'M DANGEEEEEEEROUS"" when they kill nothing.

10/10 would enjoy seeing those lines in Global Offensive"

""[b]I Rate it [spoiler]8.5-10[/spoiler] Stars[/b]"" Highly Recommended!"
6694,If you like cs 1.6 then you should like this one too.
6695,"Truly the finest first person shooter to ever grace the PC market. Gearbox has set the bar incredibly high, and since Condition Zero launched nobody has been able to even come close to matching its superb design. The graphics may be a bit dated, but let's just say that when it released, it was without a doubt the ""Crysis"" of its time. If you are a fan of shooters, PC games, Valve, Gearbox, or just good games, you owe it to yourself to buy this game."
6696,"Great game !!  Has a good single player campaign and the multiplayer is still one of the best online FPS out there !!
"
6697,"this is the one of the part of the counter strike 
this is one of the adtion game which is play similar to counter strike
i like this game
"
6698,9/10 Bots in this game are actually better than most shooter players.
6699,"Awsome game :D 
Ever One Like this Shit Game :D"
6700,love playing this games keeps me going for hours
6701,Best GAme!!!!!!
6702,Yes
6703,Still my favorite of all the CS titles. Sucks I'm still banned from most of the popular servers :(
6704,Nice :)
6705,I've been playing CS-Z for 15 years now and it still is amazing. CS is one of the best games i have ever played and i play a lot of games on pc and xbox 360. With the great gameplay and  low but awesome graphics CS-Z is one to buy and play!
6706,"i love deleted scenes 10/10 the rest of the game is okay, but 1.6 is still more fun"
6707,Awful.
6708,Good game :)
6709,I had a different idea about this game.. somehow once i tried but i felt this game wasnt meant to be single player. If you like single player's game this one is for you.
6710,"This is a fun game, bots could be more challenging but all around great fun."
6711,good!
6712,kinda good game
6713,I LIKE THAT WITH LEVELS
6714,This game is only good because of the built-in bots.
6715,If you think this game sucks the world should quarentine you (10/10
6716,"Condition Zero was the last GoldSource game published by Valve. The development of CZ began in 2001 by Rogue Entertainment and was passed to Gearbox Software (Half-Life: Opposing Force), then Ritual Entertainment (SiN), and finally Turtle Rock Studios (L4D/L4D2). 

While Turtle Rock Studios' later collaborations with Valve, the two Left 4 Dead games, were a big success CZ didn't turn out so well. This hyped singleplayer Counter-Strike title gave us nothing more than a mappack, most of which were just remasterings of 1.6 maps, which had to be completed with the aid of friendly A.I. You have to assemble your team of counter terrorists in CZ, the better bots being more expensive in in-game currency than the weaker ones. Once your squad is all set you're off to beat terrorists X amount of times on a certain map to continue to the next map to do the same exact thing. The main flaw with this campaign is that in order to progress the player must often partake in counter-intuitive challenges, such as killing three enemies with the auto shotgun while surviving the round. It takes what could have been a nice simple campaign and making it very tedious and overly long. Hey, if Turtle Rock wanted a longer game, they easily could have whipped up more maps. Most of the maps in this game are slight redisgns of Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. Oh, speaking of which:

Condition Zero Deleted Scenes is an unfinished but functional version of Ritual's CZ. It's a mission pack of 18 levels and 99% of its assets are recycled in Turtle Rock's CZ. Deleted Scenes is a great campaign with mod support.

In conclusion, Condition Zero isn't that good but it's a worthy buy for Deleted Scenes. Valve must have known CZ wasn't as good as its Deleted Scenes since most of the advertisements show Deleted Scenes levels."
6717,Love this game forever!
6718,"To be honest i like the older cs games more then the new one and this is my favorite game of the cs games :) and i love the Deleted Parts too its like a campain in cs :D
10/10 game"
6719,made in 2004 and it is still more fun then cod Ghosts
6720,i like the single player element to cz
6721,"i like this game,when i play this game and have the aug or sig, watch out i'm being the heat....lol"
6722,This A Perfect GAme
6723,"This game is quite a let down from the original CS. I mean there are no major problems but little things just have to have me say this game is not worth the full price. For half price, yes buy this it's really fun. But $10 isn't worth it, there's a lot better stuff on here for that price. Still stands strong and I do recommend it though."
6724,awsum game :)
6725,This Is Good Game.......:)
6726,The BEST game i ever played :) <3 i enjoy a lotz while playing the game with my clans and my brothers :) these game improved my AIM's :P :P I wish to became Pro in the game :) <3 I lOve SAS in Ct's and ELITE in T's :) <3

6730,This is a great game.  I first played it back in 2005 when it first came out and still love it.
6731,"Pretty much just CS 1.6 with updated/more maps, offline practice with bots, a campaign, and slightly better graphics. On its own, I wouldn't recommend it, but it comes bundled with 1.6 for only $10 (so it's pretty much free) so it's worth it."
6732,i like turtles......
6733,ITS A GOOD GAME
6734,the best game wver every one shld buy it......
6735,Awesom
6736,"I still love this version of CS after all those years not playing it. The challenge is gone, but reliving memories is great. Would recommend for CSS / CSGO players."
6737,"One of the buggiest games I've ever played. It seems a joke. These are the reasons to not buy this game ever:

1. Very repetitive
2. Non sense puzzles to solve to make the game last longer: Stupid like a switch does not work until you kill an enemy that is hidden somewhere.
3. Everything is scripted: Sometimes there is friendly fire and sometimes not, some enemies can be killed with barrels some not, enemies will teleport infront of you.
4. Very poorly scripted: NPC can block your pass to finish a mission so you have to load a previous save to finish a mission. NPC are ridicously exposed so they can be killed and missin fails.
5. Very buggy: Sometimes you cant climb a ladder or sometimes you have to load a previous save because something that was supossed to happen didn't happened.
6. No realism at all: Things like killing bosses with 5 headshots with an sniper rifle, enemies shooting behind bushes where you cannot see through, enemies shooting you in darkness, etc.
7. Really poor difficulty level: I played in hard mode. The first missions were just fine in difficultie but for some reason, the more I played, the more overclocked the enemies are: yes, overclocked. Enemies will run faster, shoot faster and need 3 headshots to be killed. The last mission I played (in japan) was so ridiculous that enemies could kill you in 1ms after you cross a wall, or walk 30 meters in 1 second, just like the first half life ninjas but with bigger guns.
8. The saves are broken: I've never seen this in my life. The save files have two major bugs. The first one is that each time you load a save file, your weapon starts firing until you switch weapon. This makes you loose a lot of ammo. The second bug is that when you load a file, you dont appear exactly were you should be and you dont have the same ammo and health. Actually I got stuck in a situation where I was appearing in front an enemy who killed me in 1 millisecond after loading."
6738,"best game if you love killing crack heads.

10/10"
6739,"The singleplayer is really well made and fun, i'd recommend this game!"
6740,I love this game.

6746,"Really great game its what made me love shooters 

Reccomended 7/10"
6747,"Counter Strike CZ should be considered as an upgrade to the the original counter strike, or even the prelude to source. Many maps have been changed and look  better . However, I would say that CZ is geared towards players who don't have a fast internet connection, or lan a lot, since there is a wide emphasis on bots."
6748,Awesome Game. This game made me a gamer .
6749,good game
6750,"Good game, but i have problems with getting it to load."
6751,its a cool game n u can also play with bots to improve ur skills..!!
6752,Best FPS game ever.
6753,"An obscure sequel to CS 1.6 that failed to match the same level of success in it's multiplayer. Hardly updated anymore, contains more maps, a Tour of Duty campaign, basic bot support and basically could be said that its CS 1.7 but is seriously inferior to CS 1.6's gameplay due to the bigger hitboxes having less focus on mods since 1.6 was taking the helm for one thing and the fact its simply put - an expansion pack to the great game in the first place.

Put your money on CS 1.6/CS:GO which has much more concurrent players, official and unofficial support, recognition and stability. This was a waste of money even if purchased alongside the VALVe pack/Steam Sale. Jess Cliffe (the pedo) and Minh Le would agree. Even Deleted Scenes (which this game is a part of) felt more of a finished product than this despite the campaign (both Tour of Duty and Deleted Scenes) being nothing short of frantic explosions, tight gunplay and versatile tactical action."
6754,"One of the best Counter-Strike games. When its on sale and you have some money just laying around waiting to be used, buy it!"
6755,"Game really suprised me.  Good players, clean servers and an acceptable ToD.  Try it out sometime maybe."
6756,i can fix the game help me fix it now
6757,Yes

6762,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero. Where to start? First off,  let me just say that you would be better off getting CSS or CS:GO (CS:GO gets hated on way too much). Now, Condition Zero does not have the best graphics. By that, I mean the graphics are terrible and the animation is equally bad. Condition Zero also has a terrible map. For someone who has never played Counter Strike, it might be fine. But for someone who has‚Äîwell, let's just say that you would be better off spending your $10 on something else."

6780,"This is probably the most underrated game of the series. As for the multiplayer part, it did not bring anything new, apart from the better graphics. But i really liked the single player part of the game, the bots in this game are the best you'll meet in the whole series. When we got this game about 8 years ago, we had limited access to internet, so this was a real treat. Of course nowadays it's not really a problem anymore, so go ahead and buy global offensive. It's just really sad that most people haven't even heard of this game :("
6781,"This game is pretty decent. It works like Half-Life with a CS look to it. its a better version of CoD to me and it's difficult, even on easy. With the ""No regenerating health"" thing to where you have to be careful every step of the fight you get into and adds a challenge. Really and and you should get it. Has gore also, but only with things explode near you or enemies. Condition Zero is CS with bots but Condition Zero Deleted Scenes is what this review is about. The regular is on the same maps as the others but with a mission thing and have to complete it a few times before moving on. CS:CZ DS is better though."
6782,"its a decent game, but it would seriously benifit with a multiplayer capability...

6787,"This game was a huge flop and I seriously don't know why they even realeased this game since Valve already had Source coming out and the biggest different between 1.6 and CZ was a tiny ""better"" (if you'r even allowed to say so) graphics and a singleplayer mode with missions and AI bots. If you buy the cs-package ""anthology"" I belive you get the cz game with it + 1.6 so in that case you can just try it out for yourself but i doubt it will be any good.."
6788,"In Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, you play a cop named Carl Winslow. As Captain of the Chicago P.D., you are the best of ""the Prairie State."" President Clinton drafts you into S.E.A.L team six, a promising squadron of the United States' finest. Your mission is to kill as many sand terrorists as possible. 

*In the game, you get to do awesome things like: disarm bombs, rescue hostages, buy weapons, and kill. 
*The graphics in this game are true-to-life, and require today's bestest and beastiest PCs to play it.
*Counter-Strike: Condition Zero has a spin-off (and less successful) game called ""Counter-Strike 1.6,"" a fan mod. The mod's *latest version, v 1.7 has been in nine years in development and is yet to come out.

V: 5 large popcorns and a medium Coke.
A: 6/6

This isn't your dad's shoot-'em-up."

6798,"Basically, it's Counter-Strike 1.6, which is already a plus to me. Though, it has a single player mode, somekind of campaign, in which not only you ahve to win rounds but complete objectives, a rather good way to train your skills.

The models for the guns though, they are different, obviously, some sound different, a bit.

It features new levels to the 1.6 counterpart, but it might not have some from 1.6. I don't know.

It's underrated mostly because well, nobody cared about it. And if you had Counter-Strike Anthology, you'd get Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes, some kind of HL1 game but with CS stuff. It's okay.

I'll rate this 7, if you enjoy Counter-Strike, pick this one up, Though CS:S, CS 1.6 and GO, will be much better choices over it."

6815,"This is the classic FPS that made me addicted to FPS games. I have been playing this game for 7 years now and I still enjoy it. Although this games is old and the graphics may not be as good as the current CS games, it still is a good game to play!"
6816,"Not too big of a difference from 1.6, but nevertheless, it's a nice game. It's pretty popular in France, and there is a lot of French players on it. But the game is dying, therefore, I recommend that you go with CS 1.6 instead of this."
6817,the best counter strike game there is! better than counter strike:GO. all those people who say it's too old are blaspheming!

6823,"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.

A player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although Counter-Strike: Condition Zero added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as ""freeze time"") to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move (one notable exception is that a player may receive damage during freeze time. This happens when a map is changed to spawn players at a certain height above the ground, thus causing fall damage to the player. This is a method map designers use to alter the starting ""HP"" of players on a map). They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral ""buy zones"" that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment."
6824,"Ever wanted to play Counter Strike but single player? I didn't think so, and if you were to play this you would probably think so too. It's so shit it hurts."
6825,Good Game
6826,quite simply one of the greatest games ever made. better graphics than the original but maintaining the same feel which source unfortunately lost
6827,Old
6828,"Still love this game. Fast paced action shooter, excellent game play, good challenging AI and still loads of people playing multiplayer. Definitely a recommended buy."
6829,"Widely ignored, but better than the previous installment. And it adds bot support. For LAN or party gaming this one is way much better than Counter-Strike. It has revisited maps, bots, better textures and models, more maps, better UI, even single player missions!

Since it comes with Counter-Strike in the same bundle, it's a nice addition for everybody who loves this franchise."
6830,GREAT GAME EVEN IF IT IS OLD NOW

I wouldn't say play it right now, but if you need a game to play in your library and you feel like CS, Try CS:CZ!"
6838,"game of the year, all years"
6839,mais cedo ao mais tarde este vai ser o jogo cada vez mais jogado :
6840,"I recommend it because condition zero contains 2 different games in one pack

1) condition zero is counter strike in its classic formula with ""single player missions"" using bots (I find it funny to play)
2)""condition zero deleted scenes""  expansion pack contains a lot of single player missions with a story and original maps...it's like an action movie. If you like Call Of Duty games, I thinks that this expansion pack is similar to it in gameplay, but it's honestly is better than CoD.

so you have 2 good single player games in 1"

6854,First CS game I ever played <3
6855,"COUNTER STRIKE: CONDITION ZERO 

Cs 1.6 with graphical improvements and bot mode.

Graphics
Same as CS but a few improvements. New player model 1 for each team. Slight improvements to weapons and such. But This is 2004 And Halflife 2 came out about the same time with the source engine. BUT this is on Goldsrc engine for a game that was realeased in 2004. 

AI: 8/10 
Has a ""Campaign"" which is basically matches against bots where you try to complete goals like
""Kill 4 enemys""
""Rescue 2 Hostages""
""use a Flashbang""
Makes a nice Practice mode for singleplayer because the original CS didnt come with bots. The enemy AI is quite good if you arent a CS Pro and I had to reapet level quite a few times. 

Sound: 6/10
Slight Improvements but overall the same

Gameplay: 8/10
Same As the original counter strike but i feel the hitboxes are a bit bigger. Recoil is still there so Spray-and-Pray isnt the way to go.

Overall 7/10
Decent Game Dont buy it on its own get it with CS:Complete Pack or the original Counter Strike

Game Design 6/10
Pretty Good. Improvements across the board. 

Overall 7/10
Only buy this with CS:Complete Set. Or with CS 1.6 Multiplayer is Mostly Dead.
 
COUNTER STRIKE CONDITON ZERO : DELETED SCENES
Expansion Pack For CS:CZ With a new campaign thats exactly like your average COD campaign WITH ZERO PLOT. I dont know why they made this because CS:S was almost finished and HL2 was hot stuff.

Graphics: 6/10
Same As CS:CZ and new enemy player models for the campaign. Not much to say here 

Sound 5/10
Same as CS:CZ but some nice (and awful) music.

AI: 4/10
TERRIBLE the enemy ai in the campaign basically cycles from Run at you, Shoot you, Run away, Repeat
Enemys have no strategy at all and Require no tactics to defeat unlike CS 1.6/CS:CZ. The only thing diffucult is when enemys respawn 2 seconds after you kill them. You dont make a game where enemys respawn after killing them to make up for there diffuculty. 

Game play 5/10
Nothing New.

Game Design: 6/10
Levels are varied like a stealth mission and such but nothing special. No new weapons. Nothing special

Overall 5/10
I dont know why the released this instead of CS:S.

6888,Awesome Game
6889,:D
6890,every cs game is good ! nothing else
6891,Great Game !
6892,My best game !! i simply love it
6893,[b]Do I really need to recommend this game??... Seriously???[/b]
6894,"The greatest game of all time, if you don't like CSCZ, I can't do buisness with ya."
6895,"So this game was released on 2004, right between the Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2. COD 1 and 2 are Classic, you would love to replay the chapters after you finnish the single player, but for CS:CZ? One-time is enough. I am not saying I don't enjoy it, but replayability marks the disparity."
6896,Totally Old School Classic Game that will never be boring and keep me and my friends awake throughout the night!!
6897,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a first-person shooter game from Valve. It is the next installment of the Counter-Strike series. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is basically a slightly improved version of the original Counter-Strike, but with many addition to the game, it can also be considered as standalone expansion pack.

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero gameplay is 100% the same with original Counter-Strike. But Counter-Strike: Condition Zero has new Tour of Duty mode, more maps and the new singleplayer campaign named Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. Tour of Duty is a singleplayer mode game that is basically has the same game mode, but has some challenges objective that needs to be completed to win the map. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero also introduce offline multiplayer bots, where you can play against AI controlled player in offline game.

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero graphics is also basically the same as Counter-Strike, only has some improved models, textures and maps, but older maps are still included in the game.

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a good improvements to Counter-Strike. I recommend this.

Rating 9/10"

6901,awsum! :O
6902,"Counter Strike is a good game, but I absolutely dislike this engine. You should check it out. I, myself, am staying away from this and will play Source or GO instead."
6903,"Not sure I can add much more to what has already been said. This game brought me to the FPS genre and Steam.
Timeless classic. Last I checked there were still active servers.
I continue to play the new installations of the CS series. Much has changed but still an excellent time.

Great physics, great weapon choices, plausible situations, very much a tactical shooter, no rambos here"
6904,Best Game after 1.6 and GO
6905,Not very good compare to CS:1.6
6906, I Love This Game So  Much
6907,"I cannot say too much in this review because I have not played very much of it, but I will admit that I really think it is cool how there is a single player game mode in this game."
6908,"like 1.6, only with less players and skins for 1.6 you can't remove because you own condition zero."

6913,"One of the lesser known Valve titles, but it's fun with bots. Oh and the deleted scenes? You'd think it would be a mod with the weird sutff in the story and all, but it's pretty interesting."
6914,No one will get this game even if its free. That why they give this away with cs original.
6915,Is fun. Very enjoy. Much happy.
6916,I love this counter  strike most because its fun and i love the campaign that comes with this game.
6917,N1 game must play this game.....

6935,This Game Is Great !
6936,nice games
6937,"I love this game.
I play Counter Strike since its first version of the game and I can tell, it's the far most fun game i've ever played. Worth every penny."
6938,alt aber gut
6939,"I played many games like BattleField series,NFS series,Call Of Duty series and few more but the only game i often used to play is counter Strike Condition Zero."
6940,Best online multiplayer game. :D
6941,"Made by Turtle Rock Studios, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero feels more like an expansion pack off Counter-Strike 1.6   The hitboxes, graphics, and guns are upgraded.  I can tell a significance difference between the mechanics of both. Grenade throwing is different, shooting does not feel ""heavy or flimsy""-- it feels sharper.  The community and servers of CS:CZ is not as active as it used to be  (Used to be a cs_assault junkie).  I'm not sure what happened, maybe they moved onto Counter-Strike: Source.  If the community was still heavy I would give this a 4/5



3/5 as of now."
6942,"i've been playing this game since i was a kid.in 2013 this is still an awesome game,"
6943,"i've been playing this game since i was a kid.in 2013 this is still an awesome game,"
6944,"This game may be old, but its really fun to play! Unlike any other Counter Strike game, this one is more or less ment to be played on single player. With every location you secure you get something called Reputation points, and it allows you to hire NPCs to work with you, and no NPC is the same. They all have diferent skill sets, Different names, and Different weapons! Also , if you buy this, you get another, erm, Version of the game, bassed off of deleted scenes, which are more of you completeing missions like defusing bombs, rescuing hostages, and this version doesnt allow you to get team mates, its just you against NPCs. id say that game is worth it as well."
6945,"At least, its for free"
6946,"A very nice game, you should try it! It's very similar to Counter-Strike 1.6, everything is the same pointing the gameplay, but the graphics differ a bit. I recommend it to all Counter-Strike lovers!
I also recommend the Deleted Scenes expansion of this game if you like games you complete and play missions in!"
6947,awesome game <3
6948,"Very good game, it's my favorite online fps."
6949,"Although I liked the Counter-Strike 1.6 very much, this version looks better only in graphics. They have done quite a job on that... ;)"
6950,Definitely a step up from CS. The single player side of this is definitely the better half. The deleted scenes lag a lot though.
6951,"Condition Zero: Pretty tough, but very, very good. Classic CS action, classic CS balance, but with moar bots. They tend to get hung up on stairs and such, but it's pretty fun. Oh yeah, and it does multiplayer, so enjoy hiding behind a bulletproof shield.

Condition Zero Deleted Scenes: A horribly racist, barely-Counter-Strike-related semi-linear FPS that feels like a bad Half-Life mod. Play the training mission and leave every other level alone, it's just that bad  (ESPECIALLY in the first mission)."
6952,Very good addon for its price!
6953,"Buried beneath the successes of Valve's blockbuster titles, Condition Zero is a hidden gem that boasts both singleplayer and multiplayer entertainment. The main reason you should consider this is for the Deleted Scenes section, which contains a variety of content not used by the base game. From a legitimate story mode (with rather cinematic and interesting moments) to fun new weapons (M60's and blowtorches, to name a few), it pretty much is worth the price of admission. The base game is decent as well, but it can be easily replicated by playing CS:S or Global Offensive with bots. Deleted Scenes features a story mode with, well, a story. 18 unconnected stories, sure, but the variety of locations ingame makes up for the lack of consistency.

Overall, it's a fun diversion when you're yearning for another story-based game from Valve. At a price of 5-10 dollars, you're basically getting two high-quality games for the price of one. I would recommend it to Counter-Strike and Half-Life fans alike."

6956,YES and nO
6957,Nice Game
6958,Good game
6959,My first FPS game!!
6960,This Game Is Counter-Strike But They Changed Some Of The Shapes ...
6961,The Best
6962,nice game
6963,The best. Its classic. nuff said. buy it!
6964,Legendary FPS game. With mission and bots to play with. Good choice if you miss this old game and to kill your boredom.
6965,"pretty good game for it's time, it ain't bad for a piece of history in your library"
6966,mUCH FUN
6967,Fire.Ruls.RO
6968,"Right, let's try this again shall we? But first, cast your mind back to issue 132 of PC ZONE. It was the one with the words 'Exclusive Review: Counter-Strike: Condition Zero' emblazoned on the front cover, replete with a balaclava-clad man about to be unwittingly run over by three helicopters. Inside was a six-page review - or should I say lamentation - about how the game was nothing like we'd expected it to be.

The thing was, right up until the moment the review code plopped onto our desks - and despite development having changed hands from Gearbox to Ritual - we'd been led to believe that Condition Zero would comprise of a group of ever-harder missions, in which you and a team of intelligent AI-controlled counter-terrorist bots would battle it out across a set of maps against terrorist forces in either bomb defusal or hostage rescue missions. So basically, just like online Counter-Strike, only with bots and personal tasks to complete in each map."
6969,"An underrated game, to be honest. It has lots of potential as it's like a CS 1.6 and Source combo.
The singleplayer missions in [i]Deleted Scenes[/i] aren't great, but they can keep you entertained for a while.
Every CS fan has to try Condition Zero."
6970,This is like a better graphic game of counter-strike 1.6 in this one Bots are already included + missions. This game is a little different from the first counter-strike. Really fun though. (recommended)
6971,it looks like the source engine not goldsrc source when this came out it step to what we have now i really think people should buy it
6972,great game its really fun when you get on the zombie servers!
6973,gr8 one
6974,"not so good, exactly like the first counter-strike. bought only because it was part of the counter-strike complete pack. (what? it was only 7.50!!). not fun though."
6975,I'm trying to play Counter-Strike: Condition Zero but it want play. It can't start because some script event shows up every time. Can someone help me please!
6976,Great Game!
6977,Good game I like to go back and play every so often.
6978,NiCe
6979,"The CS:CZ is not bad but isn't more significantly improved to the original. The new bumpmap textures, training camp, new models and maps are fine, though.

As for the Deleted Scene part, I would consider it as a bonus DLC for CS:CZ. The Deleted Scene is generally a Single Player game based on CS but it contains a cool Fibre Optic Camera attached PDA and a blow torch to sneak and peak inside enemy lines.

If you are a huge CS fan, buy it and I find this game OK but maybe a waste as CS 1.6 and CS:CZ are almost identical."
6980,Got the game when it came out at 2004 and it great!
6981,The best of all CS.
6982,Hardest campaign I have ever played..... Love it
6983,"this game has the original game (counter strike), the original counter strike condition zero and the condition zero deleted scenes but ¬øwhat is the different thing? the difference is the normal cz have a mini history and the condition zero deleted scenes have a history like half life 1 but in my opinion i prefere more cz deleted scenes than the normal but buy it is interesting :D"
6984,It is a very good game!!!
6985,"This is like a prototype version of CS Source...It's not cs source , it's not cs 1.6, something in between...
It has bot missions, the bots are not really dumb, they are ok...on expert they will f*** you up."
6986,"my last version of this review was kind of angry, this game acually isnt too bad, the hostage system is really good in it"
6987,Great game! 5*
6988,"Wow! 3 in 1 bundle this is great im starting to like the old school CS even if there is now CS:GO, CS 1.6 and Condition Zero Wil Stay The Best Forever 
Ps. Fuck the Old game haters go suck a Elephant Dick"
6989,I do not reccommend this game because I was banned or slayed of 7 different servers for no reason whats so ever. My ping to everyserver is 100+ and even though the shooting is better then 1.6 it's just not worth the hassle.
6990,OP
6991,"Picking this up is at least worth it for the Deleted Scenes missions.  But I know what you're thinking - ""Counter-Strike done Cawadoody style?""  Surprisingly the missions are well done, with just a few misfires (like the Obligatory Stealth Section and one mission with lots of rocket launchers and snipers placed where you can't avoid them often).  Basically, it's a great excuse to use those nice CS weapons without having to deal with bunny-hoppers and AWPers.  Also, the main game's multiplayer practice missions are nice exercises to bone up on your skills with."
6992,"Singleplayer is relatively simple and straightforward; fun, though. The names on your teammates are a nice touch, but I get worn out rooting for Cooper when he's the last one left, because he can't hit the broadside of a barnacle.

6993,i like this because it runs well and the gameplay is good. cs go runs slightly slower though. but this game has easy to understand stuff
6994,GOOD GAME!
6995,"If you're looking to practice your skills in Counter Strike, play this game! :D 8/10"
6996,Enjoyed campaign but nothing special.
6997,GIVE 75% OFF AALL WILL OVE IT ON VALVE GAMES
6998,"Counter Strike: Condition Zero seems good at first. A single player Counter Strike experience? A campaign for one of the most played games ever? BOTS? Sign me up, right? Well, it would have been absoultely good if it was made by one company and published by Valve. You see, it was going to be made by one company, but for some reason that I don't know, they gave it to another company. Than ANOTHER company. It just finally ended up at whoever made it today.

The game itself is NOT bad. It's actually fun. I quite enjoyed playing the campaign, even though I had no idea what was going on. The only thing that lacked was the ""tour of duty"" thing where you play with bots. It was really short and I beat it in, what, 2 hours?

I don't know why people always diss this game. I liked this game.

Overall, this game gets a 89/100 for me."
6999,This is the best FPS game I've ever played.. Awesome gameplay! models look better than 1.6..
7000,mission awsome
7001,Not 1 seck playd:(
7002,"Been playing CS:CZ for 10 years. Really awesome game, even with an old engine."
7003,"A good shooting game but there are some things I don't like it, like when you throw the flashbang grenade and it blinds you even if you are not turned to it.The magnum sniper rifle too, if you are running, and you shoot somewhere with the scope it doesn't hit where you wanted, even when you're running, it should not happened. In general, I recommend to play!"
7004,"Buy the complete pack for $7.50, nuff said"
7005,foarte bun!
7006,"classic fps, similar to counter strike 1.6 just a little more update.. highly recomd getting this if you dont already 10/10"

7009,good

7011,I like the maps on this game and the campaign.
7012,They would've ruined single-player FPS with this hadn't they thought of the disaster that was Half-Life 2.
7013,One of the must have games ! Buy it
7014,:)
7015,"This game has a gripping story-line and amazing gameplay elements, fantastic gunplay and breathtaking graphics. A must-buy of 2013-2014"
7016,bra skit ^^
7017,So addicted to this game.
7018,"SHOULD GET THE GAME!!

Edit: Still playing it in 2018"
7019,"To start out, I've really got more like five hundred hours in this game. I started playing it obsessively long before Valve thought to add playtime records.

It's fun.

The bots are fairly competent as long as you disallow them from buying grenades and the list of maps that come prepackaged far outstrips that of the original Counter-Strike. (They're also far prettier, at least as much as they can be on the GoldSrc engine). Hostages are, as always, somewhat brain-dead, but they're nowhere near as bad as the ones in Counter-Strike: Source--although the fact they all wear identical orange jumpsuits makes me wonder who really are the good and bad guys. Isn't variety the spice of life?
Sound design and quality are improved slightly from the original game and many of the less generic maps lack that kitchen_rats look that's become so indicative of Half-Life's engine, so that's a plus. At the same time, a lot of maps have odd collision detection issues and I'm somewhat bothered by the fact that Counter-Terrorists are as chatty over the radio as their criminal counterparts."
7020,"awful, awful voice acting, and the campaign is terrible from the start. Don't buy."
7021,zero people enjoyed this shit.
7022,Ever wanted a CS with a storyline? This is it. You just got to love all the different kinds of missions and equipment.
7023,Best Game in Human History! :) :P
7024,"It's counter strike but a gold icon GOOOOOOOLD 
"
7025,best of the bunch
7026,"A great fun set of single player side missions built off the original CS game, relatively short but not bad, does a good job of adding a few extra hours of entertainment to CS. 8/10"

7032,"Counter-Strike: Condition Zero picks up the classic CS formula, and takes it to a new level with the addition of a singleplayer campaing; Deleted Scenes. It also features another singleplayer mode in which you can play missions in the classic maps from CS. As for the multiplayer itself, well, it's basically the same as the original CS, with two new character models for each faction, and, for the first time, built-in bots.

However, as this game was released shortly before the release of Counter-Strike: Source, it suffered from that: most CS players would stay with the classic CS, and the new players (or those willing to switch) went to Source. Due to this, this game is not as popular as every other CS game."

7034,Epic game
7035,Love it!
7036,Muito bom !!!!
7037,Best memories :)
7038,"Fun game, but not too much of a community with it anymore. The multiplayer is full of empty servers, but there is a singleplayer you can play if you are bored of playng with REAL people.

Overall, I give this game a 7/10"
7039,"Great game. It is 2017 and I still enjoy playing it. The online game is not dead and there are great players too. If you ignore the fact that grenades completely ignore the laws of physics, and have a range from Australia to Texas, then you'll have a good time."
7040,bassicly its like the first counter strike but with additions like the riot shield wich is awesome !
7041,"This was the very first PC first-person shooter game i have ever played on PC (way before Half-Life and the original Counter Strike) back in the year when it came out. I remember when my uncle's friend gave us the CD back then. And i started playing it with my sister, she took charge of the keyboard arrows while i was aiming and shooting with the mouse during the first mission ""Recoil"". 
I don't think we got past the second mission and after sometime later i started playing the game alone but never finished the whole singleplayer campaing myself until several years later.
I always liked the singleplayer missions, soundtrack and the goldsrc feel, even if the game might be ""outdated"" for the time it came out (2004, same year as Counter Strike Source and Half-Life 2)
In terms of multiplayer gameplay it is pretty much the same as the original Counter Strike (1.6) with graphical changes, new maps and other stuff but i'll always prefer 1.6 when it comes to style and gameplay.
I do recommend it if you wanna have a singleplayer experience with Counter Strike or just wanna play the slighly changed multiplayer.
I'll always come back to play Deleted Scenes and always have a nostalgic feel when i play the very first mission while the fact remains that Jeffrey Epstein truly didn't and never killed himself."
7042,#1 online game
7043,xD
7044,This game is friggen awesome!!!
7045,"10/10 Citizen Kane of gaming, flawless, best game Valve has ever been involved with, perfect. Just kidding, it's pretty awful. At least Valve was nice enough to show this disaster to the public. It's good for some laughs, at how awful the game is.

(This was written about the deleted scenes portion of the game)"
7046,"I just love the terrorists, I guess they have the advantage... with th ebomb and all.

7056,"This recommendation is for Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes.

What can I say, other than it's basically Call of Duty made with the GoldSRC engine.

It doesn't look good, animations are clunky, it usually takes enemies two or three headshots to die (seriously) and the stealth parts can get really annoying.

Even with that, it managed to keep me entertained long enough to actually finish it, but in short bursts. I don't think anyone will find themselves playing this game for more than 40 minutes or so at a time.

I give it a 6 / 10 only because I finished it and because FPSs are one of my favourite genres of gaming, but if you're not into FPSs I'm pretty sure you'll give it a lower score.

5-word summary:
GoldSRC wasn't meant to CoD."

What makes this Game so great?

It is a First Person Shooter in a line of Progenitor series that started in the late 90s.
Even though the Single Player mode is ignored by Most Player however it's Multiplayer popularity still remains today. There are various Multiplayer Servers around the World with tons of Mods to make Player experience more engaging. 

Popular Mods include Death-match, Gun-game, Zombie Mode and Clan Wars.

There are 2 Single Player Modes - 
1. Tour of Duty
2. Deleted Scenes

Unlike it's predecessor, Condition Zero has the ability to add Bots to Multiplayer Servers.

Some of the most Popular Maps people play in includes Dust2, Inferno, Downed, Aztec, Italy and many more community submitted Maps.

If you are the part of that Group of Kids that started their Gaming Career with this Game then i would recommend you Buy it just for the sake of Old Memories and also new experiences at the Servers. For new Players unknown to this Game, you will surely enjoy this Game with it's simplistic Graphics and interesting Modded Servers."

CS:CZ is not. It's bad. It's really really bad. The weapons just feel off, the singleplayer campaign is frustrating.
'Condition Zero' is for the hardcore fans, and those prefer a quick online match with CS1.6
If you never played Counter-Strike before, go play 'Global Offensive' or 'Source' - or even 1.6, but don't touch 'Condition Zero', for God's sake!"

Though might not be the best game you have played, this game certainly raises its voice when it comes to multiplayer. Thousands of players (Or more) still play this game, so you won't run out of servers to join in and play. This is the only Counter-Strike game that has single player missions - So you can develop your skills in a fun way rather than spawn bots on a random map."

7179,OH
7180,"Condition Zero is merely Counter 1.6 with bots. Sure, they make an effort to add structure by giving you points after every mission to choose better cobinations of bots to accompany you, but its just the standard multiplayer maps and gametypes.

However, it comes packaged with an extra game called 'Deletd Scenes, which is an amazing single player title. If you can see past the action cliches and terrible accents, then this game'll provide hours of entertainment in a raft of unique, fully fledged missions. Settings are well varied as you take your place in the ranks of different national anti-terrorist organisations.

Despite offering a brand new setting, the game utilises plenty of familiar assets from multiplayer CounterStrike, making it an easy game for any 1.6 or CS:Source pro to get straight into."
7181,One of my favorite counter strikes.
7182,"I love this game!  Its awesome!  T's can move hostages (unlike in source) and Hosties duck and run for cover, and escape.  CT's get a shield, T's bomb looks cooler when on the move vs (source)Furthermore it is a gnarly game, so buy it!  :)"

Without the CS context, it's a basic run and shoot experience, a dull version of Blue Shift or Opposing Force with no puzzles. Although having no outstanding qualities, It does manage to entertain as the campaign reaches a climactic end.

7246,"The first CS FPS game that i started playing and got instantly hooked onto, the pro's (read people who spend too muc htime on CS) have this thing of saying 1.6 is better than cz, but it makes no sense, everything is better in cz, otherwise it would not have been an upgraded product over 1.6, sadly though there are no servers left for cz in most places including India. I think Valve should create some official servers in every country to keep this game alive and it is definitely better than 1.6"
7247,"An odd guilty pleasure of mine. Somehow it's haggered engine, the counterstrike guns, and it's desperate attempts at being a ""modern"" fpser from the mid 00s all comes together in this sort of charming way,"
7248," really like the game, but I couldn‚Äôt find the stupid cake."
7249,these many years of playing.but still on top of the list..... just cant have enought of it no matter how much i play...

7252,"Of course, everyone knows Counter Strike is an excellent FPS. Condition Zero is essentially a beefed up CS 1.6 with a objective-oriented single player campaign, nicer and newer textures, and the ability to pick up dropped grenades. If you haven't already been entrenched in 1.6, I recommend giving CZ a try.
Ultimately though, CS:GO is the defacto game at the moment. If you want competetive gaming with an active community, that is your best bet."
7253,this GAME sure ROCKS when it comes to FPS!
7254,"We all first starting to LAN this game in early 2005. We all bought copies and LAN'ed every weekend. This is a classic game, better than Tactical Ops, really! Still servers for anyone who still wants to relive the past or make a stronger presence today and in the far future!"
7255,perfect!!!

7267,"Edit ages later. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero offers a campagin mode if you want it, some more maps, and visual upgrades. While there aren't as many servers now, this was always my personal favorite GoldSource CS title."
7268,"b√§stttt
"
7269,Good ol' times... I only wish I could go back and play it even more :D
7270,not bad fun game with the many mods
7271,It's kinda like an offline skirmish with bots of varying intelligence as teammates. Each person you can choose has a different level of teamplay and bravery so no two will act alike. I guess it might be good practice since everyone online has already played this game for years.
7272,Depois do 1.5 pra mim eh o melhor jogo da franquia .. =p
7273,"The singleplayer part is epic, much better than the half assed Call of Duty campaigns imo."
7274,"This game is FAR superior in CS 1.6 in terms of visual and aesthetics, 1.6 fanboys have bricks for brains and can't let go of their shitty low-poly models and textures ""nostalgia"". Seriously, it [b]IS STILL[/b] 1.6 but with enchanced visuals.

It also has a walkthough-style campaign, if you played Half-Life you would know this."
7275,Mix of counter strike and counter strike source.
7276,Best FPS -game ever!
7277,"I don't usually enjoy playing the earlier versions of games such as this, but this particular game and Counterstrike 1.6 are exceptions. Surprisingly, they're still very fun to play despite the outdated graphics because the great gameplay that all Counterstrike games provide is there. What's even better is the lack of lag, which makes for less frustrating times. I especially like the tactical shield and the old knife animations. ;)"
7278,"Know when you ask for it, and when it happens, you really regret it? Yeah."
7279,LOVE IT ;)
7280,u can play if u have no 1 to play with
7281,"Condition Zero in itself is a unique package, allowing for progression of teammates in an AI environment. Nowhere near as popular as it's predecssor or successor, Condition Zero still provided a unique experience with an interesting change in visual design that is quite often forgotten.

Deleted Scenes provided the first step towards trying to turn a very popular and successful competitive shooter into a single-player goal-oriented experience. While not inherently mind-blowing, the low cost of Condition Zero in combination with some neat ideas put together to provide a small, but interesting run through the ideas of what Ritual Entertainment was putting together for their contribution.

Simple, basic, still interesting."
7282,"This was a singleplayer campaign addon to CS:CZ. I personally had fun playing it, but felt that it would have been gloriously entertaining as an online co-op game. It was released shortly before Counter-Strike Source, so it barely got any attention. I only recommend this to people wanting CS vs Bots with some story mixed in."
7283,"How do I own this shit? Fuck.

Don't buy this, I'd give you mine if I could."
7284,"Just a re-skin of the original Counter-Strike with official bots.
But the Deleted Scenes campaign is somewhat enjoyable, even though it's underrated."
7285,"Hot pieces of ass walking down the street are nice, and so is this game."

7292,"There are thousands of better multi-player shooter games out there. For some inexplicable reason Counter Strike (in all it's shitty glory) seems to have attracted and sustained the largest fan-base. Overall there is nothing remarkable about this title, but ask another ten or twenty people and you'll likely find a lot of positive opinions."
7293,"Better models, mission packs, nice (but buggy) hostages..
Nothing to compare with other CS games, so in some words: The Best !"
7294,HELL OF A CONDITION YOU GOT THERE!

7296,Super Weno
7297,CS with the plot is bad. This CS have a plot.
7298,"I played this game with my friend Jake once and I Didn't do too well! His responce after the game was over was ""wow I guess you really just don't try at anything""

I'm sorry Jake I didn't try and play good at Counter Strike"
7299,"Loved the way they introduced the idea of the game by making a game that basically teaches you how to play in multiplayer.  The story mode was interesting, but kind of lacked an actual story.  The AI was good and the multiplayer was ok but it just didn't compare to the original."
7300,"I originally made this review for Condition-Zero: Deleted Scenes because I liked some of the campaign missions. That still holds. It's nothing story-based, it's just you as a CTU doing CT things 
like:
-Rescuing Hostages
-Killing the bad people
-Stopping the bad people from doing bad things
-Bhopping through levels
-Holding truckloads of weapons in your back-pocket

It's alright, nothing to rave about when it comes to a literal console port"

7307,"This game has good graphics and is about guns and war.
I think you will like this game if you give it a shot it is hard and it is tough to beat I have never beat this game before because it was to hard and risky I rate this game 9/10"
7308,Cool graphics :D
7309,.
7310,Best game you'll never play.
7311,"extremely UNDERRATED game.

CS + story line = AWESOME.

downside: too many scripted events in the game. so after playing it 1 time you will know where the enemies will be.

i LOVE the part where the mission is in Russia. coz you get to use the AK-47. :D"
7312,Best classic FPS game of all time!
7313,*yeah* that's cool :o i recommend that game lol

7316,"are you tired of playing campaign or always shooting at bots? now is your chance you can play gungame, normal, paintball, and so much more versus other players"
7317,"For such an old game, I found alot of enjoyment for this. Theres lasers, bank robberies, puzzles, stealth missions, hostage rescues, not noob friendly.

Pros: Great Gameplay.
Fun Stealth Missions
Not nooby friendly.
Puzzles
Shootable Vents
Fiberwire (Add's alot to gameplay and stealth missions)
Incorporated real world possibilities, you can shoot a guard without alerting others cause the bank vault is soundproof.
Lots of audio lines.


Cons: You cannot drop your weapon.
You find yourself using your knife lots of the time since you can't pick up enemies guns. Gotta be one of the biggest cons.
It's autosave feature overwrites good save spots with instant death save spots, like autosaving when your about to be shot or activate lasers.
Hostages stop following you on the easiest of turns.
You turn a corner and a hostage says they can't go sorry.
The AI coop missions are horrible because your friendly AI rushes out in the open and dies. So you have to solo it then move your Friendly AI"
7318,"So I was reading a study and actually then whole band of Coldplay was working with Gearbox ATM (Machine) to make this game. 
So if you liked it at all, you might be a Dickbutt who enjoys Duke Nukem and Borderlands too.

7323,good if u want a campaign for Counter strike.
7324,It was a pretty good game for about three days but that was only because I have all the other counter-strike games and this was the last one i bought. Over all its a good game especially the new graphics.

MASSACRE LEAGUES OF BRAIN-DEAD TERRORISTS WITH [i]ONLY[/i] AN MP5 AND 3 SNIPER RIFLES

Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a revamped version of the original Counter-Strike with new maps, new graphics, new weapons and interface improvements. It also includes a single-player mode with difficulty levels and bots you can swap out as you progress through the 'tour of duty'. It's fun on Normal difficulty and below, but on Hard and above you need to be good at CS to really make progress. There's also custom campaigns available online.

The 'Deleted Scenes' are a series of single-player missions. Unlike the regular CZ, these are scripted, generally linear/cinematic in nature and put you in a wider variety of unconnected situations including bank robberies and drug busts. Some of the missions are great, some of them are average; sometimes it can get quite campy as evidenced by my original 'review' above, and there are only a handful of custom missions I found online. Almost none of them really go into the backstory of the terrorism and assorted nefarious acts on display here: you're just the tip of the spear meant to counter terrorist aggression.

The development of this game is rather storied, with four separate companies working on it before its release. It was intended to be a revamp of the original CS with a single-player mode, then it was turned into a game with single-player missions (the Deleted Scenes(. Then it was restarted again in the vein of the first version, which shipped with the missions anyway. For more details, you can read [url=http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/Development_of_Counter-Strike:_Condition_Zero]this[/url].

If you're a fan of classic CS and feel like something different, I'd say give it a shot. I'm not sure if it'll do anything for you unless you're a CS/oldschool shooter fan, but since it's an old CS game there's still plenty of people playing it online."
7330,"Worth getting if you like counter-strike, it comes with CS 1.6 and Condition Zero, and also has a single player mode in the deleted scenes."

7347,"badass surf maps on the servers, gungames, and death match maps"
7348,IF YOU DO NOT BUY THIS GAME I'LL PERSONALLY SHIT IN YOUR MOUTH.
7349,"When I saw this game came with ""CZ: Deleted Scenes"", I assumed it would be a neat little addon that I might spend 10 minutes watching. It is exactly the opposite. ""Deleted Scenes"" is more fun than the game itself. It's a fully-playable Counter-Strike mission-based adventure. It's almost like the CoD of Counter-Strike! I love it, and if you like the original Counter-Strike, I guarantee you will too."
7350,"Pretty good addition to the CS franchise, although not the best.
The graphics are slightly improved, which is a plus, and there's a bit more variety in weapons (mostly skinned though), but there's also a lot of bugs.

The added ""Singleplayer""/Bot mode alone is enough to buy this game, but the addition of the Deleted Scenes Singleplayer (kind of wonky at that) puts the icing on the cake.
Multiplayer is very much the same as CS 1.6.

It's more like if CSS and CS 1.6 had a child.

Still, pretty good."
7351,Don't play this shitty game.

7357,jo
7358,"Many (most?) people play either the original CS or CS:Source, but for me CS:CZ is still the best incarnation of CS. It fixes a lot of the bugs in CS, yet retains that special gameplay which (and let's be honest here) never surfaced in the Source version of CS."
7359,coocl game
7360,"Nice updates to the levels, textures, models, sounds, and most importantly, the Bot/Team-mate AI. Not sure why this game gets the hate it does as it plays almost identical to 1.6.

If you love 1.6, you'll likely enjoy this as well. I especially like all the new levels though many have not yet made it into source."
7361,"Play if stoned, otherwise avoid."
7362,"dieses Spiel ist eigentlich zimlich gut und man ist schnell √ºberrascht was man damit alles anstellen kann so viele Mods wie ( Star-Wars , Left 4 Dead , Furiens ) und noch viele mehr ich muss auch zugeben manchmal war ich sehr √ºberrascht was das spiel alles zu bieten hat ^^

Edit: So schade es auch ist aber dieses Spiel wurde von ""Counter-Strike Global Offensive"" total vernichtet! Damals gab es jegliche Art von Mods und ca. 1.500 Server jetzt nach der Erscheinung von CSGO gibt es ca. 1.000 weniger Server und darunter sind leider die ganzen tollen Mods. Es gibt nur noch die Mods ""Furiens, GunGame, Deathrun, Jailbreak, Surf, Zombie Plage und Base Build"", nat√ºrlich wahren diese Mods schon immer dabei, mit dem Unterschied, dass ""Star Wars, Left 4 Dead"" und ein Haufen an Furiens Servern ""down"" sind und damit nicht mehr erreichbar. eine echte Schande, dabei ist CSGO nicht mal ansatzweise besser als Counter-Strike Source, was ich auch gerne kaufen w√ºrde, allerdings wei√ü ich nicht wie stark dieses Spiel getroffen wurde und ob es da √ºberhaupt noch Server gibt... traurig aber war, CounterStrike Conditions Zero wurde von CounterStrike Global Offensive zerst√∂rt."
7363,challenge for offline play
7364,Maybe old but its still new
7365,"Hi people, I just thougth I'd write a recommendation for this epic early 2000 game. So you play as different factions from the original Counter-Strike from 1998 but with updated graphics and infact new models. The game has AI that attempts to look at you making you think that the AI likes you.. Then they run at you with a machete, and don't forget how you are ALWAYS alone even though you saw 5 swat guys behind you  1 min ago. So, this game in a nutshell: Lone wolf, cool, time killer and something you  can play without stopping. It's not like you get stuck in Sierras obvious traps and puzzles. I also recommend you to YouTube it, because a video is always better than words! (fuck you) have an awesome friggin day.. (that was for me) enjoy DS."
7366,"I've put more hours in this game, than I ever should have. But I don't regret any second of it. 

This game sums up my entire summers as a teen, lots of fun servers, people, and just is a great shooter in general.

Long live OD zombie mod </3

Someone please reopen that zombie mod server aha"
7367,Great FPS although it is old but more people play this than the source version which has better graphics
7368,"Great game, only 9 dollars, its a must buy."

7371,"Single player/campaign: Developer of this campaign make sure to teach you how: Russian‚Äôs, Mexican‚Äôs and generally every human being that is not from: US, Germany or England are terrorist and you should afraid of them. Almost gives me an idea how this was actual political campaign against every living thing that is not part of the west culture ( the same culture that killed over 100 million Native Indians in order to take their land üòâ ) 2/10

Multiplayer: the most cancerous community in the history of video games. Maps are a bit nicer then in Counter strike 1.6 .5/10

Anti-cheat: VAC is outdated, every retard can download cheat and use it. 0/10

Game updates: none 0/10

General: As all Valve game this one had great idea but Valve failed to protect their customers from cheaters and general abuse 

Last thought‚Äôs: Fu‚Ä¶ck you Gaben!!!"
