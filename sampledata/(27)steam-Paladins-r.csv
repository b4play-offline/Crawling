5,This game will ruin your life.
6,Even though this game is older I still think it is extremely under rated. I play it off and on and probably will continue to do so until they stop updating it. Its easy to play and get good at. Just something fun to play when you don't want to tryhard
7,no good

9,Boring
10,Cool game
11,cool
12,games coo its fun they just be nerfing foos cuz theres alot  of soft ass foos who i be merking so im prolly the reason skye got nerfed
13,"This game sucks. Like man, its so boring, bad graphics, you dont even know what you are doing, play experience : 0/10"
14,"Valorant's Father. I approve.

15,I have a few hundred hours in this game on other platforms and i have to say i love it. tbh i like it better than overwatch. Also Saati ass.
16,if you like losing brain cells :)
17,"One of the most underrated games of all time. 
Still plays great, nice player base, and can run on a calculator from 1988.
Devs are always updating and maintaining the game. They still listen to player feedback and buff/nerf accordingly.
It also has a bot mode, which is nice to learn the game or just mess around with a new character.
One my only grips with the game is the matchmaking. It seems to be ""get steamrolled or be the steamroller."" But not always.
If you haven't tried Paladins, do yourself a favour and download it.
"
18,"I loved it initially, but the more I played the more I saw the balance issues. Having a lot of characters is great but when you don't really adjust them to make for a more evenly balance match you can end up getting steam rolled by several gimmicky characters. I think it's pretty decent but the balancing is just terrible that I can't recommend until actual fixes are made."
19,palalins i <3
20,just be good
21,It is like Overwatch but its still somehow original the characters are cool and pretty fun and this game does not have DVA so thats a bonus
22,"Paladins is a very fun and exiting game.. I've been playing for years now and this is such a fun and cool game. There's Combat, strategy. I love this game!!!"
23,I lik the clash of clans goblin or something
24,"untill the game fixes the major bug problems they should not be adding new champions


ow better"
25,removes the problem of your friends not wanting to spend money on overwatch
26,"worst matchmaking of any game out there...every 3rd game there is some1 that dc in ranked games, cause bugs..bugs... bugs.. crashes...crashes.. then report system does not work...no bans for players trolling...nothing is been done.... yes.. they make shitty new champions.. thats all"

43,i played when it first came out on switch and have loved it ever since and when i found out that ppl still plyed this i decided to download and it is as nostalgic as ever!
44,"It's enjoyable with friends. However, balancing is not in the game's vocabulary resulting in your team getting paired with a group of experienced players all because they have 1 newbie on their team. Still recommend it if you have a group of friends. "
45,Good game  MUCHO FUN MANY WOWS
46,Why is everyone in this game so horny? Looking at you Skye.

	[td][b]Gameplay mechanics & UI[/b][/td]
	[td]★★★★★ (Phenomenal - multiple characters (currently 57) with distinct mechanics to learn and master ; loadout system makes it so that each character can be played in several different ways ; strategically deep ; interesting map designs, technically speaking, and most of them a pleasure to traverse ; UI elements are helpful and fit the experience perfectly ; great balance between teamwork and individual player agency in defining the outcome of each match ; character roster feels balanced in the way that each and every single character has either one or multiple counter picks ; straight up fun)[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td][b]Visual presentation[/b][/td]
	[td]★★★☆☆ (Good - fun looking colorful maps, though lacking in finer detail ; some of the coolest, most recognizable and memorable character designs in hero shooters I've seen to date, default skins and otherwise ; does show its age overall, graphically speaking ; [i]cartoony[/i] art style not for everyone)[/td]

[b]Overall[/b]
[b]3.7/5[/b]

Balanced, strategically deep and lighthearted. If you're looking for a hero shooter with a heavier tinge of MOBA and you don't mind dealing with some bugs, Paladins has got you covered."
56,"I only feel pain and suffering when I play this game, I cannot stand playing it anymore, It hurts my soul to even open the game. 10/10 would recommend playing"
57,"This game always reminds me why I uninstall when I play shortly after a few months of break.

1. Bunch of bugs that never get fixed
2. Terrible character balance. It's impossible to reach a perfect balance in any game, but some characters in this game just never get a proper nerf or buff.
3. Terrible queue system that encourages losses by forcing you to play with teammates way below your skill level. People who play with friends have massive advantage, almost guaranteed wins in casual. This is the most damning part of the game because the game is extremely team reliant."

65,yes
66,"fun game
porn like characters
people afk every match
would play again"
67,its a game
68,"Actual fun game to play from time to time. I personally think the skill based matchmaking needs to be turned down a quite bit. Other than that it's enjoyable, also this game has female BUTTS (which is very important as those are a rarity in modern age gaming.) Also nerf Vikor, he's too easy 

Pros:
-Easy to learn difficult to master
-lots of characters
-cool skins
-different weapons for every character that's not just limited to guns
-decent battlepass system
-female butts


Cons:
-Viktor is way too easy
-broken sounds
-slow start up time even on a SSD
-furry skins
-male butts.
-kinda stricted skill based matchmaking.

8/10, give it a try"

71,"I want these two problems to be fixed and improved as soon as possible.

1. I hope there are more a lot of maps to enjoy. And in ranked match the randomness of map selection is weird. Some maps never selected in particular season.

2. There need be more point tanks to play. As you know the main point tanks are almost Barik, inara. I want there are more."
72,koga the best
73,The balance in this game is awful. Not having 1-hit KO headshots on snipers feels absolutely terrible. There are hackers everywhere. Toxic Russian trolls everywhere.

77,"Very smooth, entertaining and good gameplay. Probably one of the best, were it not for the company Hirez has demonstrated to be over the years: incompetent. I have to admit in the last 2 years they started to listen to the community and the game has been improving, in my opinion.

I think you should try it, experiment it - it's free after all. Give it a chance, it's a great game. It's just... managed real bad."
78,very good game if you know how to play
79,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
80,Love this game
81,"Game is very bugged and glitchy, but I have had endless hours (Close to 700 total) of fun mastering new champions. With that being said, this game can be very infuriating some times due to the old engine it was built on. This game is free so no complaints on that.

82,"This game has terrible lag issues, I have a great stable wifi connection yet normal things like the 5 second countdown before a round would still lag and be like 5-4-2-1, this game needs to be fixed."

I have an addiction to buying booba skins now so that's pretty cool I guess. Game is aight too."
109,need healing
110,As someone whos played for years and loves this game to death I suggest not getting into it at this time. The current state of the game is just pumping out new characters and skins as soon as they can while leaving bugs in and crappy maps on the same playlist we are tired of playing. They wont change any game play or improve it. This used to be an amazing game but for now its so hard to play a single match.
111,good game
112,.
113,"This Review is geared towards Overwatch players looking to swap over to this game.  

I played this game a few times a couple years back, but I always liked Overwatch 1 better as it was more polished from a visual standpoint.  However, with Overwatch 1 going away permanently at the beginning of October, and myself having a burning hatred for being forced out of a game I did pay for and into one I did not, nor do I enjoy or want (Overwatch 2).  I am forced to look at similar, alternative games.  So, I came back and gave this another shot.  

I post this review, because I figure some people will be in the same position as me about this time next month at the latest and this may be a game they hear about or come across from their own research.  i will say this, Paladins does have stuns and CC, which were a big complaint from people who could not figure out how to play around them or learn how to bait things out, etc.  However, It offers ways to limit and counter that through purchasable perks as the match progresses and as you learn champions, you learn what to prepare for going into the matches and the buy system makes you more aware of preparing for such things.  

Also, instead of three roles, you have four.  Tank, support, damage and flank.  Tank and support are very similar to what you would expect out of those roles in Overwatch but the real difference in damage and flank is how they play.  The regular damage role if lower mobility and higher output, especially good at playing with the tanks and supports and tearing down shields.  The flanks are VERY high mobility and are designed to get in the back line and take out healers fast and get back out, or to win duels with out of place, lower mobility, squishier targets and punish them for bad positioning.  At least, that is how I play them.  

I will say that if you try this out and enjoy it, it is worth the small investment to get the forever champion unlocks. However, you can play this game and unlock every champion over time for for free and never spend a penny to play it.  

Another pro I can give this game is that, for the most part, the community around it is far more positive than other communities.  I rarely see too many insults thrown around and when they are, those of us that have come from more toxic game environments can easily shut them down and make them look like clowns with a single quick wit insult from the chamber of thousands we have stored up and they have never even considered.  Really though, I don't condone soul destroying unless they start it, otherwise, be nice or at least shutup.

The level design Paladins is actually good.  I haven't actually seen a map yet that makes me want to choke a developer.  Most of them are fun and present unique challenges depending on the strengths and weaknesses of the champion or champions you choose to play and while most of the flankers constitute ""dive"" there is no whole team dive, which I feel like is overly broken as of Overwatch 2 sine they did remove CC mostly, which was the only real reliable counter to that.  paladins is still a team game, but individual skill still has that ""carry"" potential I personally missed in Overwatch because it had not been in the game for a long time IMO.
(A few heros can still carry, but they are a select few)

So, with all that said, if you are looking for a fun alternative, I recommend Paladins.  It is worth a shot and the learning curve isn't that bad.  

TIP: You can even center your HUD in the middle like Overwatch in the game settings.  (this helped me stop forgetting my ultimate existed.)"
114,"Abandoned game, wont even let you log in if you had an older account at some point"
115,"Its rage in a can, half the time you are looking at your wonderful teammates and wonder why one earth are they trying to 1v5 , is it that hard to wait you specimens . The entire player base deserves to be examined in a lab ."
116,jey
117,i played for 1340 hours just get the game
118,"Game won't even launch anymore. I've tried reinstalling the game, I've edited a crap ton of files and still nothing. Its like they dont want you to play the game"
119,great game. lots of diffferent champions u can customize. makes it a lot replayable
120,I have now purchased the entire Australian supply of Burberry Hero eau de toilette.
121,overwatch down syndrome son
122,yup
123,"This game is pretty shit. unbalanced ranking system. if you intend on solo playing, this is not the game for you. it is filled to the brim with subpar players and it's not rewarding to play, regardless of rank. I think it falls into most ""f2p"" games, so the player base is literally filled to the brim with absolute shit tier players"
124,"I love how the game is built. Overall, the game is fun to pass the time. The characters to play are very fun and remind me a bit of Overwatch. I would highly recommend playing this game."
125,"One of Hi-Rez Studios' game clones with big babies that leave me feeling like a big baby almost every match because they leave me to suffer. :(

Only play for your masochistic tendencies and if you want to be punished by your friends, not your enemies."
126,"Theres a lot of good in paladins but also a lot of bad. Many of the characters feel unique and as someone who enjoys grinding towards unlocking things that aspect alone makes for lots of hours of playtime. The modes are all fun, with siege clearly being the fan favorite. However the game falls short in terms of system optimization and balancing. Many, and I mean MANY champions are either too powerful or too weak with no in between. That and the game seemingly had issues for me in terms of crashing and loading. When it works, it works well, but the stability cannot be overlooked and in my eyes should be fixed asap. Overall, I love paladins. Its an enjoyable shooter, and I love many of the different champions. I believe it has potential to blow up even, however due to the poor optimization I fear it'll become more annoying than anything. Overall, 7/10 game, and I hope it improves as time goes on.

Also I liked the rwby collab."
127,"Melhor que Overwatch, não que seja grande coisa."
128,"Very frustating, little bit of fun"
129,"Sim, é um jogo muito divertido, embora seja desbalanceado, eu recomendo para as pessoas que gostam de hero shooters, ainda mais se for de graça :D"
130,"It was a very great and it has great bones.
But the microtransactions in your face are not helpfull, and an active turnoff.
Dont mind my 5hrs I got a lvl17 char and played quite a bit more.
"
131,awesome!
132,suddenly won't launch. pass on this.
133,You might wanna get some ADHD prescribebed medication.
134,If you're disappointed by overwatch 2 and you wanna feel a tingle in your balls then give this a go

136,They have Engie skin from TF2 so yes
137,i have a illness
138,Cool game
139,overwatch but not dying
140,MOVE DAMMIT!
141,"The game is a mess of bugs, the developers lack feedback to the community, and the recent 'balance' is outright dumb. HOW, CAN THE DEVELOPERS OF THEIR OWN GAME, BE SO BLIND AND IDIOTIC WHEN IT COMES TO THIS GAMES BALANCE"
142,"god
"
143,balanced
144,"''GET FREE REWARDS!''
*Clicks on it*
''Watch this AD and get 150 gold!''

10/10, the game has better morals than the devs."
145,the worst funny experience that I ever had. furry and boobs
146,Like.
147,GREAT for team play with friends!
148,"Falsely perma-banned, ive always loved paladins, always, even since beta and yet, here we are, with this account banned permanently for sticking up for myself over Pylerr and some others saying they would sexually assault me and kill me or vice versa. One dude telling me to get off paladins and go back to prostitution coz thats the only thing girls are good at. Thats not even all of it either. I got permanently banned for sticking up for myself and saying the truth."
149,"honestly such an amazing game, If you are a beginner my tip would be to buy Makoa as your first champion"
150,"Its a fun game that i like to play with friends. You need to have a lot of nerves for bots in ranked games, but hey every game has its flaws.. Okay game overall"
151,"Join 50+ million players in Paladins, the free-to-play fantasy team-based shooter sensation. 

50 million+.. seems like its the biggest game ever
game is blatantly lying in the description of the game already"

However the game wont boot after the anticheat loads. I tried fixes nothing worked."
155,goofy ah
156,"pretty much the poor man's overwatch, couple of bugs here and there but a fun game overall"
157,yes
158,Good game to kill time with till OVW2.
159,It's obvious game copy a lot from overwach but it also feels different and enjoyable
160,"it's fun, but playing can be extremely bullshit. though this is fixed with competitive."
161,fun
162,"I would literally never recommend this game to anyone, it can be fun but it's more frustrating then not, it's a bit like OW they bring out new heroes that are op so 90% of the other heroes just can't be played as they are way too weak, tanks aren't tanks because their health is so low that a dps can kill a tank in 2 seconds, a support can kill a tank, a tank can kill a tank but will have a harder time, basically any tank without a shield is just garbage and unplayable, some dps are too op and a few healers too, tank wise there really isn't that many good ones maybe three at best"
163,addicting game for Overwatch type game style players.
164,fun game
165,"Budget overwatch with more characters
"
166,"The only thing better about Overwatch is the lack of bugs, in rest I prefer this game. (Yes, I have played Overwatch as well). It's just fun to play."
167,maeve
168,Ass game of ass players
169,It's like overwatch but free
170,This game is very unbalanced. Most games you cant do anything because the other team ahs 20+ kill streaks.
171,Sound in the game is extremely off and has been off for months. A game with high burst damage and high mobility is unplayable without correct directional sound. Please fix this.

173,"I personally think it's a great game, at least the idea of it is, for example the deck feature, but there are so many bugs, and they are major bugs, like getting into terrain. The hitboxes are really big which makes you feel like you either do not deserve your kills or your death feels unfair, the developers barely work on fixing bugs, it feels like they fix 10 bugs every update but introduce 20 more bugs. The developers tend to release champions and skins way too fast for it's own good, new champions are fun, new skins are cool, but they work on that more than bugs and balancing, and that's not mentioning how insanely broken champions like VII are. All and all, download this game if you want to, but don't have your expectations high."

178,"Not gon Lie I got peer pressured into downloading this game. Never before I have I ever been so glad I gave in. Played this game years ago with a few buds. Life happened and we all went our separate ways for a while. Redownloaded this game just recently and it's still just as fun as it was when I first got it. 

It may take a while to get the characters you want but it's worth it. Just like smash bros, once you find a character you like, it's a completely different game. Since it's free, you got nothing to lose but time so may as well give it a try."

203,"Its alright but feels mostly like one team tends to steamroll the other. Maybe thats just the lower playerbase with more saturation of hardcore fans or thats just how its played out for me. Its fun when your team is the one steamrolling, obviously not so much when your team is the one getting rolled.

Still its faster than overwatch in both gameplay, que times, and match times which in my opinion makes it more fun."

206,"Pros: Lots of heroes, cool skins, free to play.

Cons: Server lag, Annoying but not game breaking bugs, Collision feels bad (Easily getting stuck on a random wall bit)

This game is fun...when it's working.  Funny Heroes, Straight forward maps, cool story, proper game doesn't take itself too seriously. 
But
The stability of the servers makes this game pretty unplayable for me at this point. Sometimes I queue up for NA server and get put into Europe. Had enough of being in a completely different part of the map when I died. Would love to pick this back up if they can fix the server issues."

210,"Is the game still fun? Yes. Should you play it? Only if you can put up with its issues.

The characters are extremely solid and fun, but that's the games main offer. As amazing as the new abilities and personalities are the game can be lacking when it comes to maps and content outside of champions.

Some amazing skins are released regularly however the game never gets any new maps and rarely gets gamemodes. Why have a roster of 50+ champions if I have to play them in the same maps over and over? Not to mention that Siege is way too prevalent, I'm sick of standing around doing nothing on the payload.
On the technical side it's extremely sensitive, crashes if ANYTHING goes even remotely wrong. Internet oscilations, any input in other apps while on the loading screen and much more makes the game crash.
There's colision issues on most maps, and models often have weird hitboxes. Good luck getting headshots.
Balancing is awful and clearly biased. Champions will often dominate for years before being addressed while a dozen are neglected."
211,my game crashed multiple times
212,"I've stopped playing Paladins for a long time ago and I recently decided to retry the game with my friend. I remember HI-rez still spamming champions updates and problems like bugs and matchmaking, aparently, the game appear to still have those problems. I really like the game even if it's community is slowly decreassing.
Conclusion:If you want a stable experience, this game is not for you. If you can embrace the chaos, it's still an amazing game."

230,"I've played Paladins since 2017 and every time I get on again it's a brand new experience. I absolutely adore this game. There are no hackers, little to no toxicity and the community is very welcoming and kind. Other games are riddled with bugs and imbalances, but paladins devs are absolutely on it! This game might be dead or dying but the queue is lightning fast. (4 minutes at most) I can't wait to see what the future of this game has in store for us. 

P.S. Golden Evie skin would be super duper :) :)"
231,"How to Make the Perfect Hard Boiled Egg
Hard boiled eggs are great food to have on hand as their uses are so versatile. Not only are they super delicious on their own, but they’re great in sandwiches, chopped up on salads and the foundation for all devilled eggs. The trick to great hard boiled eggs is not over-cooking them, which can leave a grey ring around the yolk and make their texture a bit rubbery. 

Things You'll Need
A pot with a lid
Eggs
Water
Instructions
Step 1 Place your eggs in a single layer on the bottom of your pot and cover with cold water. The water should be about an inch or so higher than the eggs. Cover the pot with a lid.
Step 2 Over high heat, bring your eggs to a rolling boil.
Step 3 Remove from heat and let stand in water for 10-12 minutes for large eggs. Reduce the time slightly for smaller eggs, and increase the standing time for extra-large eggs.
Step 4 Drain water and immediately run cold water over eggs until cooled. Rapid cooling helps prevent a green ring from forming around the yolks.
Did you know? Nutritionally, both brown and white eggs are identical unless the hen’s feed has been enhanced.
Tips:
For easiest peeling, use eggs that have been in the refrigerator the longest. The less fresh the egg, the easier it is to peel.
To peel a hard boiled egg, crackle the shell all over by tapping the egg on a hard surface, then roll the egg between your hands to loosen the shell. Begin peeling at the large end. Hold the egg under cold running water or dip it in a bowl of water to help remove the shell.
Hard boiled eggs with the shell on and kept in a sealed container will keep for 1 week in the fridge.
To determine whether an egg is hard boiled or raw, spin it! If it spins round and round evenly, it is hard boiled. If it wobbles while spinning, it is a raw egg."

241,io my beloved
242,Fun game. Playing with friends is even more fun.
243,"As a person who has played both Overwatch and Paladins (but admittedly more Paladins) I would say that this game is still fun in comparison to Overwatch. I see this issue appear lots between fans of both games and I personally believe that both games have their upsides and downsides. I personally love the customisation which this game has to offer, which allows every character to be played completely differently from game to game by using different talent and load-out cards and even different items! I think this adds lots of strategic depth to the game, other than just ""whoever can aim the best wins."" I also think it has a very diverse range of characters, which wonderfully fill the four roles in the game (damage, flank, frontline and support). Despite this, I do understand where issues arise with the game. Firstly is that there is a defined meta, which certain characters are weakened by and certain excel in. But why not just pick the best character? Well this is where the issue of character unlocking is presented, since certain characters need to be purchased using coins or gems in the game which can be either very hard or virtually impossible to gain without spending real money. This makes the game very pay to win, allowing players who spend money on the game to have an immediate advantage. This gap can be overcome with enough time in the game however, since eventually you can unlock every character you want naturally. As stated prior, at certain times there are defined metas, where certain characters may be too powerful or not powerful enough. Overall it is a very good game however... and it's completely free to play!"

258,"I've never put so much time into a game before.
This is basically 1st-person superhero simulator, with so many characters that have all kinds of powers you can think of: flying, teleportation, and so much more.
My childhood gives a nod to this game, as I've always wanted one like it.
Play it."
259,what a great game!
260,"I neither like nor dislike Paladins. It's one of the only game that runs on 60+ frames on my device so I shall keep playing.

Having said that, the bugs are horrible. They could very well lose you an entire match, and it is frustrating. One of the most prominent ones is where you're supposed to be on you mount, but your simply stuck walking in third person. When this happens, you cannot do any damage, or use any of your abilities. It is a wild card draw as to when it corrects itself (it does, but after a long wait), and more often than not, you are killed without any means of fending for yourself. 

The Champions themselves are either wielding weapons equivalent to Sockem Boppers, or are breaking the reasonable threshold of power, and dominate the field by far. Tyra sprays blindly, tearing into the entire enemy team, while Maeve is almost impossible to spot due to her speed. The Champions should not be a use and throw tool to make money every season. A colorful assortment of candy, and only a few of them taste good? 

The maps are nothing remarkable, but are definitely fun to play. The game feels fun to play, the abilities are all well thought out and immersive. More gamemodes would help, but it isnt lacking much. 

This was me, definitely play it and decide for yourself, its free after all.

386,"No. 
At first this was ""The Overwatch killer""now both overwatch and Paladins killed themselves without the help of the other game. Just not worth investing time or money, Some champs are literally 1v9 machines while others deal more damage to themselves than to the enemies.
It's just pathetic what happened to this game, looking back 3 years ago when it was fun to play and worth investing money in. Now you have to invest hundreds of dollars praying to get the skin you want from the over 100 chests available.

It's not fun, not balanced, not worth your money or time. 
Hi-Rez steal game ideas just to execute them on a mediocre level because of the way they monetize their content. When you open any of their games, be it Smite, Paladins or Realm Royal; it looks like one of those shady sites with lots of ads and promotions, it looks bad, feels bad, the game hasn't been optimized at all, and I think it's still in beta? 6 years after being launched. If that's not a red flag then you must be colorblind, and whatever color you see, if it's related to this game or this company, it's a bad omen."
387,d
388,"More fun than overwatch imo. But here is the problem:

The bugs in this game make it a mess, from sound bugs to menu bugs its insane. This game is is running on spaghetti code. Paladins NEEDS a paladins 2 so they can start over

Also another small problem. They dont separate balancing for PC and console. Champs that are bad on console gets buffed and become OP on PC as a result(sha lin is the best example here).

Devs need to stop pumping out champs like crazy and start working on fixing other pressing issues"

My favorite part of the community is for sure the Reddit! Not a single bad vibe on that website! I absolutely love the fanclub ""femboy corvus"" they add so much interesting detail to the games lore!
all in all a 10000/10 (my wife left me)"
405,if you like overwatch and don't want to spend money to get a new game then this game is just like that only better more characters and more rpg elements put into it
406,This game sucks
407,"devs care more about brand deals, customisation's, and the money resultant from micro-transactions 

the upgrade systems are needlessly complicated. having 3-4 different levels of upgrades adds large amounts of customisation granted but for just a casual player its a massive turn off. 

i admit im likely bad at the game, but i come back every year or so to see if its improved and whats changed, and honestly it still feels just a chore to play. i play with freinds and well its more fun joking with them than it is actually playing the game so much so i only come back when they seem to come back every 6-12 months or so before their eventually turned off by it again and start doing something else. 39 hours of gameplay. and honestly the first 10 were fun the rest well yeah no. 

and this isnt even covering the massive balance problems including the fact that one character has been known to be broken for years and the devs wont change it because they want this one character OP for some reason. then couple that with the fact that every new character that with the constantly violently changing meta of what is and is not OP with characters and upgrades and well. its just not fun to play.

honestly you might very well enjoy this game it works as a good substitute for TF2 given its current issues but if TF2 fixes itself somehow go play that instead. to end of ill leave you with this. they paid a Vtuber to collab with them and livestream the game for advertising, and the best recommendation they can give is the same as mine right now. ""i can see how someone may like to play this."". 

TL:DR play for like 5 hours if you dont like it after that dont continue, i only racked up time cause i wanted to play with friends and even now the game is just not fun enough to even let me do that.  dont trust a scrub like me try it for yourself and decide yourself if its worth the time investment or if that time could be spent playing other games you like. after all this is all my opinion, my friends seem to like this pretty much."

428,"to start, I've never been a fan of paladins OR smite putting a majority of their cosmetics into loot boxes or other forms of gambling paywalls. paladins is especially worse with this, so I don't really plan to ever get skins unless they're on sale, or the rare chance they release an instant buy skin that piques interest.

if you don't mind gambling your money away to look cute, welcome to paladins! 

that said, the gameplay is actually really great, especially when compared to OW. the variety of game modes, FREQUENT new champion releases, and character customization through item builds/card loadouts are a few things that set it apart. I like playing characters in different ways, rather than a constantly set role, and for a free game you can't really go wrong with giving it a try!"
429,"This game is basically Overwatch mixed with League of Legends. As a huge Overwatch fan I'm surprised to say that this might be better. It has the same elements and mechanics as Overwatch, but it's more customizable and doesn't rely too much on which character you're playing many different play styles and strategies can be used no matter who you're playing. The game also has the same feel and art style as League of Legends. Just one thing I have a problem with is how the game looks. It was decent looking for it's time but nowadays it looks like a crappy mobile game. So glad it's free, however I probably would've been down to pay full price for this. 8/10"

433,Long time player over the years and it's always improving each time that I revisit it. Good balance of characters and play styles just like Overwatch. People thought it was just a cheap knockoff in the beginning but honestly it's maybe just as good or even better.

Please patch so it can run on ARM chipsets. I have M1 Mac and your Mac version is not compatible with newest version of M1 or M2. Please patch so I may play.

460,"Haven't Played this game for that long, but like, its a pretty good game for what it's trying to become. I can tell you with one hundred percent honest that this game isn't a knock off. from beta to this point and I'm still fascinated by the changes the developers work on. But like who am I too talk, I just spent almost 3,000 hours on this game, idk."
461,BEST GAME EVER
462,dont
463,"very fun but there are so many bugs. every aspect of the game has at least multiple bugs that have been around for years and haven't been worked on. its fine for what it is but the frequent crashes and game breaking bugs get annoying (some bugs include crashing randomly, getting kicked from queues after being put in a match, crashing in match and getting a time penalty, rank qualifiers arent counted randomly, abilities get buggy and just wont work correctly, if you buy a character in the character select you wont be able to select a character at all, etc ). it feels grimy to spend money on it when the devs seem like they couldn't care less about anything thats not their money making skins. i played for over a few years on xbox (around 600hrs) and stopped playing for about a year to a year and a half, but after starting to play again there are still the exact same bugs."

482,"What once could of been a genuine contender vs Overwatch and TF2 is now unfortunately another Hi-Rez Product (tm) like Smite. Plenty of fun, way too many hero's, uneven dev time spent between all their projects. I still highly recommend the game, but its a shame to see its lost potential."

485,Its like battleship.
486,fun
487,oh HiRez the way you  are. Compared to Over Watch I like this game much better the catch to this is cards before the game determine the play style of a character and it can vastly alter the way they play. But... do note HiRez is classic for bugs CLASSIC HIREZ things can get wonky hardcore players crave and want more and no matter how much content they stuff into this lovely game it will always bring bugs or questioning stuff but casually this game is fun and still better than Over Watch >=) 6/10!
488,Fun
489,what a crap game with toxic players

492,nice
493,"I am a 54-year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing Paladins.
I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started playing this game.
In less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours.
This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son
because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam
account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game
since the 90's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent some hours playing Paladins with other people who were surprisingly kind.
I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Playing video games
reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought
me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well."

496,Very good game
497,"fun free alternative for overwatch, plus works on a potato pc :ThumbsUp:"
498,"this game is like overwatch if every member of the dev team had no arms and didn't know what ""balance"" meant.
also has one of the worst and most putrid visual styles i've ever seen in a shooter, every single character looks like they were ripped out of wildly different shovelware mobile games and the skins only worsen that issue. all the maps are completely devoid of anything resembling personality.

this game is fun for like the first two hours when you don't know what's going on, but once you actually start to figure it out and get matched against others who also know what's going on this game absolutely falls apart. the balance is non existent, certain characters just exist to get buttfucked while others are nigh-uncounterable. 3/4ths of the cast have at least one completely bullshit move, you really have to wonder what sort of krokodil the devs are ingesting to think these characters were okay to make.

this game is a great study in what not to do when it comes to character design for class-based PvP shooters"
499,"Great game suprisingly way more depth than first thought, anyone can jump in and become good"
500,honestly slaps
501,"because this game is free, you'll experience so many toxic players. The community itself could be toxic, people literally make accounts just to troll and report you for either not being good at the game or because they hate themselves and want you to suffer. 

I recommend playing with friends, it is a fun game, but it has a lot of OP characters that can be very annoying to go up against. I'd also recommend recording your progress in case you meet toxic players, or kids that scream at their mics. (Don't know if they fixed the mute button)

I feel like the devs are abandoning this game, like if someone falsely reports you and you get banned after spending so much money on it, it's just not kewl. People can literally get away with this too, especially when they're on the switch (you can't report their switch accounts and they can always make another account)

play at your own risk."
502,"I got this game to play with my sister - the cross-platform feature is SO neat.
I'm really unskilled when it comes to first person shooters, mainly because I'm an extremely uncoordinated person. But this game is pretty easy to get used to!
It's fun to play with friends and there are tonnes of ways to make the game easier if you're new to FPS games/more challenging the more you play and get better!"
503,"[h1]Good but needs a lot of fixing[/h1]


as much i like this game its hard to recommend, each season is a downfall
full of bugs, bad servers, toxic people etc
each time they nerf bad characters and buff even more some of the most strong ones
like androxus this season and the one before this is sooo op; AND THEY BUFFED HIM THIS SEASON 
the game is good, but the devs suck at balance

the game is fun sometimes but before it was soo much better too bad the devs keep adding champions almost every month because of [b]MONEY[/b] 

maybe later it will be better, or even worse

good to waste time, not good if you want to play for long times like i did but i started when the game was actually kinda good and fun, now its unbalanced and boring
kinda good graphics and design, annoying bugs, bad team balance and etc
i would like to recommend it but i simply cant, not friendly with new players"

Lots of Paladins

Cons:

Buggy
Un-balanced
Frustrating
Crashes often
Most players are toxic
Weird and confusing party system
Lack of visual cues that you completed something
Just bad Overwatch

I could go on for ages.

Verdict:

This game is not the best, but it's free, so the only thing you loose is time if you hate it."

532,"I used to play this game when I was much younger and much worse at games. I come back today and Paladins is actually pretty fun to play at the moment mechanically. When you're zipping around as a Maeve or Koga it feels really nice, or when you absolutely crush in damage with Drogoz. 
I think where I start getting annoyed is the tanks and broken supports. The game feels the most fun when damage teams are bashing their heads against each other, otherwise characters that are fun to play are forced into a boring playstyle in order to stay alive against crowd control. 
On top of this, because of the role system it's almost impossible to win a game without all roles being filled in some capacity, which results in some people playing the less fun tanks and healers. (Although this is more of an inherent flaw with team shooters and not necessarily Paladins.) At the very least they don't force role queue. *cough*
With new characters, I respect their desire to implement more complicated and more fun characters as time goes on, but it just feels like the newer ones are steadily outclassing the old, making it so that the more linear older characters have to be buffed in their niche to absurdity in order to perform. (Drogoz doing unbelievable damage for example.)

Overall, mechanically I feel like they're going somewhere. There are many other flaws that will most likely keep new players away, like the massive pool of bugs or the questionable balance. Still a very fun casual shooter you can play while your mind wanders. 

The more I play the more I feel like a payload game with *just* assassins would probably just be better."
533,"It sucks but hot men and women, sometimes."
534,I like how the battles can last up to 10 minutes it reminds me of call of duty black ops 1. I play this game all the time look at my YT channel for more to see game play of this i just uploaded a video tonight -8/19/2022 newest capture made on 08/06/2022 I will post more most likely.

550,"I loved and still love this game. Having started playing in the fall of 2017, I saw a lot in this game (including bugs). But today there are a lot of bugs in the game, and many of them are very critical.
The last bug made me write this review. After starting the rating, picking the last champion from the lobby, the game crashed. Everything would be fine, I'm already used to departures. But when I entered the game again, I saw ""Deserter 6:..."" I burned out. But this is not all, the sound still disappears in the game (shots, team voices, completely character sounds), again constant crashes, and so on. The game has a terribly toxic community, unbalanced characters, buggy quests (either wrong or not done at all), forgotten champions that don't get skins.
Once again I love this game and keep playing it. But if nothing changes in the game, then nothing will remain of the game for the next 2 years.
P.S. please Skye already at last.

Я очень любил, и до сих пор люблю эту игру. Начав играть осенью 2017 года, я видел многое в этой игре (в том числе и баги). Но на сегодняшний день багов в игре очень-очень много, и многие из них очень критичны.
Заставил меня написать этот отзыв последний баг. Начав рейтинг, пикнув последнего чемпиона из лобби, игра вылетела. Всё бы ничего, к вылетам я уже привык. Но зайдя в игру снова я увидел ""Дезертир 6:..."" у меня выгорело. Но это ещё не всё, в игре ещё пропадает звук (выстрелов, тим войса, полностью звуков персонажей), опять постоянные вылеты, и так далее. В игре ужасно токсичное коммьюнити, не сбалансированые персонажи, баганные квесты (либо написано не правильно, либо вообще не выполняется), забытые чемпионы на которых не выходят скины.
Ещё раз я люблю эту игру и продолжаю в неё играть. Но если ничего в игре не поменяется, то ближайшие 2 года от игры ничего не останется.
P.S понёрфите Скай уже наконец."

565,"It is a great game and i had a lot of fun on it, but unfortunately it seem like the developers do not put that much effort into this game anymore, i saw the old 2020 paladins battlepass and we can see the difference between 2020 and 2022 in term of cosmetic and effort.

Kinda sad to see this game being totally abandoned by the creators."
566,.
567,.
568,"Really fun game, a lot of the characters feel like they are similar to other games I am familiar with but their own fun unique twists that make the gameplay engaging and challenging. The skillcap on some characters is extremely high but there are also characters that feel really easy to play. All in all, I would say there is something for everyone here."
569,very good
570,"[b]TL;DR - Not a bad hero shooter. New heroes relatively frequently, but competitive is a bit dead. FOMO cosmetic model.[/b]

[b][u]Pros[/u][/b]
[i]Heroes[/i] - New heroes actually come out, unlike that other popular hero shooter. They don't mind doing things that might seem a bit silly, so most of them are fun to play. Supports and tanks in particular feel like you actually have some agency over what you do and aren't just a glorified babysitter or objective paperweight. There's 56 heroes as of writing this review. 17 damage, 14 flank, 13 tank, and 12 support.

[i]Playstyles[/i] - Paladins has a unique card system, where you can make a 5-card loadout for your heroes from a variety of cards unique to the hero. Most of them are stuff like ability duration or cooldowns, ammo, and health but some help to shape your character around a specific ability. Combine this with the three ""talent"" choices you get at the start of the match and it can really provide a lot of variety and flexibility. Sure, some builds might be objectively ""better"" than others, but almost all of them are fun.

[b][u]Cons[/u][/b]
[i]Cosmetics[/i] - FOMO heaven. See a skin, emote, or player avatar you really like? Odds are you'll never get it. Most of the monetization runs on battle-pass style stuff that can't be obtained after they end. There are a few here or there that you can purchase with gold (currency earned by playing matches or doing daily quests, slowly accumulated over time) or crystals (premium currency) but most of them are palette-swaps. 

[i]Lootboxes[/i] - Other than the battle-pass stuff, your only other option for cosmetics is to gamble on some lootboxes. Luckily there's no dupes, but some of them have massive drop pools. The three ""standard"" lootboxes have 676 (flair), 295 (gold), and 220 (diamond) drops as of writing this review. There's a few other themed ones with only 8-10 drops in them. For some cost analysis, the currency for lootboxes is $100/8000 currency. This is equal to 320 flair boxes, ~106 gold boxes, or a paltry ~26 diamond boxes. The themed ones vary in price, but they're usually 300-400 crystals each.

[i]Bugs[/i] - Typical Hi-Rez charm. Pretty buggy, and the one of the latest makes it so you can't hear a lot of the game sounds. This includes your own weapon sounds and enemy ultimate callouts or their weapon sounds. Can make it pretty unfun, but usually gets fixed by a restart. Usually.

[i]Competitive[/i] - Fairly dead, depending on your rank and region. Average queues are probably anywhere between 5-15 minutes. After waiting for that, there's also a decent probability someone will dodge because they're pissy that their hero of choice got banned, or they were gonna get stuck picking tank or support. Might also be a byproduct that hero pick order is in descending rank. Person in first slot who makes bans and gets to pick their hero first is the highest rank on your team, person who picks last is the lowest rank."
571,yes
572,"fun...and free!
its got a Overwatch meets SMITE vibe and it just works"

577,the game is fun and it is very well madein my opinion it is better than its competitors like overwatch and its free
578,Is only really good if you have friends to play with
579,b tech overwatch but its fun
580,"The fun is absolutly there, the competitive play is there. Its really good its just they keep messing stuff up with nerfs that we dont need and buffs we dont want. there are also some glitches but every game has that"
581,"I remember a time when 'free' games were mostly unheard of.  A friend recommended this game to me...

I normally don't play free-to-play games, but I must say, this game gets a big thumbs up from me, even with all the bugs and such...  This game is FREE!  Pretty good quality content I must say and the game runs as smooth as butter on my dated PC.

For those complaining about the 'bugginess' let me tell you; years ago you mostly had to have very specific circumstances to play an online multiplayer game (unless you had a lot of money) and for some its still that way.

And for those complaining about the price of skins (which I agree can be a little high) 'its all in the numbers' and those of you that can't afford it, I'm sorry you weren't the target market for the price value (a company has to make their money somehow).  On the good side; for those of you that cannot afford the skins, you're still getting a quality game for FREE, and you still can unlock some skins and champions just by collecting in-game coins by playing!  That's a fair deal if you ask me!  And who knows maybe the prices will come down later on and the skins and extra content will be more accessible at a lower cost.  And as for me personally, I did spend 7.99 to get some package deal.

As far as the community goes; that's out of the game dev's hands and up to the culture of said player base.  And here's what I have to say to the player base: be fortunate you live in a time where you can get a game like this for free, I would enjoy every minute of it and try to make it as enjoyable as you can for you and your fellow teammates.  Talented people worked hard to provide you a mostly FREE experience.  And if you can't support the dev's via buying their additional content, support them by creating a positive, fun community other players want to play in.  All the best to you!"
582,good game
583,Why new character comes with a bug?
584,Yes.
585,stinky poopoo
586,fun game
587,yeah
588,"I'm a father with little time for gaming, but I found some extra time tonight and decided I wanted to play Paladins for the first time in a few years. I was really excited about playing Grover again, I've always liked the concept of the character and it seemed fun. I haven't had an opportunity to play games in a literal year so let me just say, I was SUPER exited to play. 

I spent 2 hours downloading this game. When it finished the files were corrupted and I had to re-verify and re-download some of them. No biggie, that was only another 20 minutes.

I was incredibly disappointed when I found out Grover was behind a paywall, but whatever, I can smash out 5k gold and buy him, no problem. Lets gooo!

 Then I got in the game, as soon as the game started, it crashed. I tried again, another crash. I googled the issue and it said I should update my drivers. Makes sense, I haven't gamed in while. I don't think it should have crashed, but whatever, I get it. Another 30 minutes and I re-launch.

INFINITE LOADING LOOP STUCK AT ""LOADING VENDORS"".

I just spent the first free 4 hours I've had in a year attempting to play this game and I was stopped over and over again poor development. I wanted to give Hi-Rez the benefit of the doubt after they screwed Realm Royale so badly, but they really are just a terrible studio only after money. They don't care about their customers or their experience, so long as the profit is rolling in. 

I WILL NEVER PLAY A HI-REZ GAME AGAIN. I WILL NEVER SPEND TIME OR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE CASH GRAB OVERWATCH CLONE. 

0/100 - Don't play this game."

612,"Very fun, if you like a more exciting version of Overwatch. Definitely more fast paced and very fun to play with friends!"
613,The turtle guy is so OP!
614,"Pre good game, a potato could run it."
615,Yes
616,t
617,I like hero shooters and this is a good one. I like the card system that allows players to customize the playstyle they like. This means two players with the same champion may play entirely differently which keeps things fresh. I also like how often new champions and other content is pushed and or updated. Totally worth buying a champion pack to play but an absolute steal as free to play.
618,its like overwatch but fun
619,super fun game to play alone or with friends.
620,"Honestly my opinion of this game is very mixed and I love it but hate it at the same time. The bugs can be very annoying and game breaking, the player base could be better, and the devs are quick but slow at the same time to fix stuff. But I do love this game, it’s just they are neglecting the game at this point. I love it better than overwatch, I wish the game can succeed. But unfortunately it’s not going in the right direction."
621,ruby rose
622,"very very under rated in my opinion because alot of people say that it is a overwatch copy but theres actually a lot of differences but the main one being that it is free and overwatch is not and overwatch just came out with a overwatch 2
"
623,its fun with 5
624,"SOME CHARACTERS ARE OVERRATED AND NEED TO NERF
"
625,good
626,"Very fun and competitive without having a community that's too toxic.
"
627,"A really good game, it has some bugs but otherwise I love Skye's buns <3"
628,tbh its a good game but so many bugs
629,cool game
630,"very good game but watch out in ranked, some people like to troll or just dont take your advice, making you and your team more likely to win but other than that clean solid game in my opinion"
631,raum best character
632,"Big mommy milkies, I mean some real honkers, some big old donkerdoons, like some real hecking kachungas"
633,"tons of fun and so many toons to play and learn. down side is the community. people are really rude and don't dare play with a controller (I am a controller player with a winning ratio). try to play casual to learn characters and people will just bash you the entire game. that being said if you can learn to ignore the ignorance of other players and just find some friends to group up with, the game is a must play. this game has made it into my top 10 favorite games of all time. if you like overwatch then you will love this game it allows toons to be played in various ways to modify how you play the role of that toon. every class is a blast and with so many ways to play each toon you can make some nasty combos. pro tip to new players learn how to play each class everyone instant locks dps, if you wanna win you need tanks and healers and like i said they are just as fun as dps toons. this game is also a free to play which means be prepared for micro transactions for every little thing skins, emotes, sprays, death stamps, ect. .i hope this helps you decide if you wanna give the game a shot if you decide to, you wont be disappointed."
634,"Yeah, Honestly i left paldins in the dust..."
635,good game
636,"fun to play with friends.
"
637,"bug ladin, can't login into server or even play"
638,"Pretty fun game, it was rough at the start because of the unfair matchups you would get sometimes in ranked but nowadays it seems more fair. Wish the game wasn't so stingy though on crystals, buying new characters, or leveling up. It's still fun though on it's own."
639,yes
640,I played it for a bit. It's alright ig
641,vora fun
642,Skye has big boobies and series says kinky thingd
643,"Hi all!

Don't play this game. Suck it up and pay for Overwatch.

Having played 300+ hours, this game has gotten no attention in term of fixing its fundamental flaws. This game crashes, has audio bugs which greatly inhibit the ability to respond to the situations in game, and worst of all the developers put all of their effort into new skins and collabs.

About the crashes: No F-ing idea why they happen, but more often than not, they cost the game as it can take minutes to reboot off a hard drive.

About the audio bugs: Don't you love knowing when champions are using their most powerful moves based on an audio cue? Well, be prepared because sometimes the audio cue just won't play. You will be blindsided by an ability, which on lower health champions, can actually just kill you outright. Additionally, sometimes you will load into the game and have this quirky little thing happen where your gun just doesn't have audio. Doesn't sound too bad, but it is jarring and wrecks the experience. If you want to avoid this issue, play the game with no audio from the moment you pick it up, that way you don't have to worry about it.

Finally, the skins: Some of the skins from the collaborations and events look exactly like another champion's base skin. Having played this game off and on for years, I came to identify champions quickly by their appearance. This company is greedy, and as a result it costs around $7 for a skin. Not just any skin though. You have to buy a loot crate with 7+ other skins in it meaning the skin you actually want can cost over $42. Come on!

All in all, I would say I have given this game more than a fair chance. Some of the more glaring bugs have been around for years. I bought a champion pack when I first reinstalled the game for $15. If I hadn't, I would have maybe 20 champions out of the 40+.
Find a different game, I will update this once they update their game to a more playable state."
644,cant open game
645,Best game! <3
646,lol
647,greatdivide is the best paladins player ever
648,Games fun and I don't have any more word
649,Viktor to the win xD
650,haev fun trying to win the game when the enemy's viktor plays literal cod on the other side
651,"How did this game not win GOTY 2022.

i swear the oscars are rigged :steamangry:"
652,Perfect for virgins
653,"I hate this game...

*proceeds to recommend the game*"
654,nice game
655,"good game
"
656,Great Game to Play
657,"Please ignore the absolute idiots with 3,000+ hours who don't recommend the game. These players have gotten 3000 times the price they've paid for this game (free to enter) at base. The additional costs of buying heroes or skins can even be included if you'd really want to. They'd still be getting quite literally hundreds of times more hours than most games, especially of this niche genre. 

Paladins is what Overwatch dreamed it would be. The art is kinda sucky sometimes and the game breaks almost every patch. Seeing players with thousands of hours not recommend this game is disappointing. Especially considering these same players are """"nitpicking"""" and inadvertently hurting the games chances of being picked up.

Bottom line? Play it, it's freaking free. The game is tons of fun and can remain entirely free if you'd like to give the devs no money. Hi-Rez is one of my favorite studios and will always remain to be because they simply understand what makes games fun. They are not the highest budget, and I understand if that makes you not wanna play, but please, I beg you, the game is really freakin' fun. Give it a shot."
658,"Fun game, easy for new players to pick up."
659,its pretty ok ig
660,Game is ok fun ok
661,"Can be kind of fun but matchmaking sucks balls, but my biggest gripe is the skins. Grinding for cosmetics is null. If you're okay with buying 99% of all cosmetics then this game is a good match for you. Buggy features causes game to crash or lose sound in-match. Its a free to play but the obsessive greed for any extra features is a turn off. Better off getting Overwatch on sale or a grey key site. At least you can get better skins through gameplay."
662,yum
663,Fun
664,vachina
665,"To quote some youtuber (idk I think it was funke): ""Hi-Rez is very good at getting lightning in a bottle, but doesn't know how keep it."" I think that sums up this game. Good, but could be better. Def worth your time tho."
666,its ok
667,fun chaos
668,"yeah its a rip off of overwachg 
"
669,very fun
670,"good

671,respect tzanca uraganu
672,ye
673,piss shidd
674,"good game, always fun to play"
675,YA
676,"game is good, but sound design is terrible, really i cant understand how bad in general the game sounds"
677,Interesting.
678,The amount of bugs and the lack of balance in this game is just rage inducing.
679,"The game itself is good, well-optimized and fun, but as with many F2P games the ""in your face"" FOMO tactics to spend money if you want to get all the heroes and skins are pretty invasive. Soon enough Overwatch 2 will be F2P and for the money i think it will be a better alternative."
680,This game is so good you need to play it :D
681,"good game, many bugs."
682,"W game
Characters have a better bum than Overatch(I like skye's bum the most and then pip's bum). Futhermore I like how original and unique the game is; the skins are cool and the graphics are really vibrant."

688,very good game because my crappy pc can even run it with good graphcs
689,good
690,"interfejs like in mobile game, but this is single defct. f2p overwatch with good characters"
691,"You might have heard already what everyone has been saying about this game and how it has been handled in the past years by hi-rez.

I'm a strong believer of focusing in trying to fix aspects of the games that affect more the player such as the sound bug which makes you lose the ENTIRE sound of the game for a match and many many bugs than just adding visual aspects.

Some new champs just have kits that are literally unfair and thus making such player a must target if you really want to play.

Healers feel useless with the new match healing mechanic.

I really don't care about battlepases, new skin lines, events and whatever, FIX YOUR GAME, rather than just try to suck the money out of the people, I have not put a single penny in this game nor I recommend you should.

Btw, forget about playing ranked, casual payload is better.

Do I recommend this game?
50/50, it's casual, you can have a great time since it's still ""playable"".
It's up to you.

706,very nice
707,"GOOD GAME!
INSANE LOOK LIKE OVERWATCH OR MAYBE BETTER BECAUSE ITS FREE LOL :l
"
708,the reviews are more entertaining then the game itself. 💀
709,A game with broken balance and broken teammates ¯\_ಠ_ಠ_/¯
710,great old one
711,This game literally makes League of legends balance team look good
712,"Horribly optimized game. 7/10 crashes on start up unless you change game files to run in 32-bit on DX9 which just increases crash change in game, textures go missing, and constant frame dropping. I have a 3080ti and i7-12k processor and can't run this due to poor optimization. Game is ran by clowns holding it together with glue and wooden sticks."
713,"Game's fun
"
714,"While this game is my favourite, the bugs are getting to much. I swear the developers are nothing more than confused monkeys who were sat behind a computer. The sound bug makes ranked almost unplayable (who doesnt love a silent drogoz ult?) , getting defeat screens after winning a match. How are bugs like this still in the game? Don't get me started on the recent 'balance' changes that have made their way to the game. FUN GAME, CLUELESS DEVELOPERS"

717,This game is so full of aimbot hackers that I would not give Hi-Rez a single dime of my money.  They don't care.
718,"I have over 1300 hours soooo... yeah I like the game.

Hopefully Hi-Rez will eventually retune the healers and just get rid of cauterize one day, it's made me quit the game multiple times just cause of how clumsily it's handled. Healers are like ridiculously overtuned for the first 3 minutes of the match and pretty much useless outside of that.

I'm sure pretty much everyone playing this game hates cauterize, and I'd love to see it added to abilities like Tyra's firebomb and not just a literally 90% healing decrease like 8 minutes in.

Anywayyyy, highly recommend the game if you don't like playing support. Honestly so much fun, and it runs on everything, but I really, really want Hi-Rez to just nerf the healers and get rid of caut cause right now it is so, so annoying."

734,"I stopped playing this game years back because people I used to be friends with people that got really toxic as a result of playing competitive/ranked all the time and it ruined the fun for me vicariously. I had about 57~ hours by the time I dropped it on Sept 16, 2017.

Now, in a matter of a couple months, I'm back to this amazing game, I've got my playtime up to 97 hours and had an absolute blast with the game again. No friends getting toxic over the game, no rage quitting, just an absolutely fantastic time playing a game that's like if the best bits of League and Overwatch meshed into a really fun experience.
I'm so glad I came back."

758,"This game is better than I expected it to be. It's genuinely fun and the gameplay is very fluid. It may seem like a lot to unpack at first but once you get used to the mechanics and find a champion you like, it's all smooth sailing from there. 

Better than Overwatch."
759,i wish i could ask for those hours back
760,"You don't have money to play Overwatch?
Play this"
761,this is a great game on my baby boy
762,I hate this game but it's that kind of hate where you come back to it for more every now and then. Recommend playing with friends if you don't want to decrease your lifespan.
763,"Overwatch is an incredible achievement in multiplayer shooter design. It bobs and weaves almost perfectly between being the quick-fix adrenaline hit you might want after a long day of work, and the thoughtful, strategic multiplayer experience that becomes the center of evening-long binges with friends. It might not have the most exhaustive list of maps and modes, but it provides nearly endless opportunities for exhilarating, coordinated play, and when you’re the one at the center of it, it feels like nothing else.

Score: 9.4

Overwatch’s gameplay has remained almost entirely unchanged since launch and centres around taking and controlling points on the map or escorting payloads from one end of them to the other, all at the expense of the enemy team’s health bars. It’s a simple setup and not an altogether original one, but it’s the nuance found in how you go about winning each match that makes Overwatch so brilliant.
Each team of six can be stitched together from the current pool of 32 heroes. Not only does each play differently and bring their own tricks to the party, but they also affect the other heroes on the ever-expanding roster with each new addition. Overwatch is a game bursting with character, not least displayed in the characters themselves. Blizzard has created a world where anything goes and everything flourishes.
To call Overwatch a “shooter” almost seems reductive at this point. Yes, it’s firmly grounded in solid first-person shooting mechanics, but there’s a vast arsenal of weaponry on display, ranging from the clunkingly medieval to the clinically futuristic and even beyond science, stepping into the fantastical. At times these worlds combine to create heroes that feel like they could only be conceived in the Overwatch arena. This is exemplified best in some of the characters introduced since launch. Brigitte, with her centuries-old mace that’s partnered with an energy shield that feels airlifted from a different era of existence. The geneticist, Moira, who can summon biotic orbs from her palms and then evade all incoming damage by fading onto an ethereal plane. Then there’s Wrecking Ball, a maniacal hamster that rolls around in a spherical mech of death flanked by two chattering machine guns."
764,just a game that contains so much hentai
765,Tf2 + Overwatch. Very good and fun.
766,"Even with its mediocre graphics, uninteresting characters and huge hitboxes, I've always liked this game more than Overwatch. Why? Because it has a much better gameplay with its card customization AND you only rely on teammates for healing (unlike Overwatch where you can pick up health packs from the ground...)"

In my opinion i think you should by it because it is really bad and boring. Thanks my dudes surfs up yahhhh my dude!!!!!!!"
789,good game tbh
790,Friendly  and fun to  play
791,good
792,COOL GAME
793,Its a good shooting game.I think it might be my new favorite shooter game.
794,i can't play why ?????
795,"Dont bother, their chat Nazi are worse than anything I have ever witnessed before. They banned me for 7 days for swearing in the chat. Though I am sure there are some of you, that love it when people get banned for hurting your feelings by typing words, but banning paying customers for 7 days for swearing is counter productive. When you can just ban them from typing. O well lost any more money from me. 

Is the actual game good? Not to bad, it has bugs which is weird for such a old game. The screen randomly goes black, the sound stops working. It also has pretty long ques even if you pick all modes, over 3 mins. The graphics are alright. The item buying system is pretty bad. The gameplay is pretty fun and fast paced though, as long as you dont mind being stuck with horrid bad console players that get 0 kills. Ill put it to you this way I played this game for like 4 hours, and i was better than 90 percent of the people playing this, and ive never played it before. You can spot console players, one they load really slow, and 2 they cant turn around haha, i suppose it is funny to shoot people who are to slow to turn around. Which is why i got banned for calling them names for being slow hahah. 

I suppose if you are a slow person, are easily offended, like to see people banned for typing stuff that hurts your easily offended brain, you might like this game."
796,very fun game would recommend

825,"Honestly, this game is amazing. the gameplay is very replayable and all of the champions are fun to play as. The problem lies in this game's polish and is riddled with bugs that makes this game unbearable to play sometimes. I hope hi-rez focuses more on bug fixes and try to polish out the game more in the near future. until then you probably want to stay away from this game."
826,Lets go Paladins!!!

I think if the game was better optimized and had more meaningful updates rather than a new cosmetic for vora every month then the game would be much better. The lack of teammates who know what they are doing really kills the game in my opinion as I find myself having to carry my entire team every match and it just really ruins the experience. If youre a casual gamer, give the game a try, if not, you wont have any fun at all."

I played Paladin a long time ago on Hi-Rez launcher (or Epic Games cant remember) and heard it was on Steam so I downloaded and played it last year.
I decided to get back into it and HOLY what happened to the game?

Paladin UI interface look like it came from a mobile game.
The experience overall feels different from the last time I played. 

A long time ago, I actually preferred this game over Overwatch and would play it for hours.
Now it's the opposite.

However, I would recommend this game to people who are new to these type of genre before moving on to more competitive one, but if you play these type of games before and just want to try Paladin, I wouldn't recommend it.



"
842,This is a good game good graphics good controls and gameplay and generally better than overwatch
843,days of my life wasted
844,"It's an ok game overall, but the constant amount of bugs makes it frustrating to play, been playing since 5 years ago and now I've reached my limit with the sound bug, which sometimes mutes enemies, so u can't hear their steps, their gunshots and even sometimes, the hit sound is not even active so u never notice u are getting hit from more than one side."
845,Need more updates to add new stuff been playing for years its pretty boring by now
846,fun
847,Saved my childhood. 1k hours on ps4 and it was fun all the time.
848,"So, I've played this game a lot and for a long, long time. It's by no means a bad game, or an unplayable mess, but it's getting close. 

Let's get the basics out of the way. Paladins is a first-person hero shooter with base character builds and a simple item system, using a 5v5 objective-based format. There are four roles: Damage (deals damage, typically from the backline), Flank (confirms kills, often at much closer ranges), Frontline (holds space, for the objective or for pressure in a side lane) and Support (heals people, but often also has additional utility such as CC). Gameplay focuses a bit more on ability use and strategy over raw accuracy given the forgiving use of hit cylinders rather that hit boxes. The time to kill is relatively low for a FPS.

Now I can talk about why I can't really recommend this game:

The game's a spaghetti code mess resulting from a revolving door of devs during its early years. At the time of writing, it is almost a guarantee that game audio will completely break for one or more characters in a given match, rendering everything related to that character silent. This is by no means the reason I don't recommend Paladins, but it's a symptom. Every patch, something major breaks. The team works on it and it gets fixed almost always by next patch, but then something else breaks. I can only imagine the frustration that must cause for the people who have to try to sort this game out. As time goes on and more is added to the game, more and more larger and larger issues may come up. There are also quite often major issues with the game's servers.

I'm a firm believer in avoiding saying things like ""the game is dying"" because that sort of thing can feed into itself and actually increase a game's decline. What I will say is that the playerbase is small enough to cause inconsistent matchmaking at high levels (ranked and casual both). The pro scene is long gone, the competitive scene has also nearly evaporated, and what little is left (Ultra League primarily) is on hiatus due to the sound bug. Hopefully UL's back and everything's fixed when you're reading this.

Added onto this, is the general design trend for new champions: The complexity of kits is steadily increasing. Not every champion suffers from a bloated kit, but there are several who do. I like that Evil Mojo are willing to push the envelope, but it causes a lot of balancing headaches for several patches after release and a ton of frustrated headaches from the players who have to play until the patches are released. 

For example, one champion had a ~70% winrate in casuals when released, was delayed from being available in ranked by a patch due to imbalance, and had to be nerfed in three successive patches before he was in line with others in his role. Even still, he has mobility far above average for his role, excellent range for his role, solid area control options, excellent self-sustain, and passable hard CC. With all the changes (and some changes to the game itself), he is a mid-tier pick, but my point is that his position is very fragile due to the number of factors involved. Small changes to the game could drastically alter how he performs, and many other champions as well. I do actually like how they try to balance new champs to be on the stronger side to get players interested. The issue is that many of these new characters do too many things at once. Too much mobility, poke, area denial, burst, CC, etc. This includes, more frequently than before, utilities outside of a role's typical kit and abilities with no reasonable counterplay. Sometimes both at the same time.

If you're new and just want to give this game a try or you're just playing casually, go for it. This review is nitpicking pedantic garbage for the majority of players. There's definitely an uphill battle to enjoying Paladins with all the character-specific mechanics of the game and the bugs, but there is a fun game buried under all that. Sometimes it shines through, but for me that's been with increasing rarity."
849,Good game
850,"Its free overwatch 

Both are toxic and dont work without everyone on the team doing their job
"
851,most mc hi rez lode pe
852,"Параша без баланса, для даунов, которые думают что умеют играть"
853,play it
854,Good Good Fun Fun
855,Very fun game.
856,i do recommend this game to play its a fun game to play with ur friends a good way to build relationships with oother people over the world too. the game is famously known for their well made champions as well as the spectacular skins made for their respective champion so i do recommend playing 1 thing though the games community is highly toxic at times so beware of them and being toxic can lead to permanent ban at the 3rd suspension so be positive to everyone even if their a little toxic ive lost my account for being toxic and that lost helped me realized how immature i was and now i get start over as a fresh new player (sort of) to enoy the game and to show the bright side of the game. (yes this is a sad pathetic way of getting my account unbanned but if its impossible im more than willing to accept the horrible fate a cast upon myself)
857,"nba cool [oo]
"
858,leave this game because of bugs. came back to more annoying new audio bug. cant hear enemy's firing and footstep.
859,best game ever♥
860,if only I could play the game.
861,Reproved.
862,Hot elf girls with their tiddies out
863,"Buggy Mess, Casual play is a joke and unbalanced. Stick with Overwatch"
864,ranked is worse than any kind of multiplayer cancer you've seen and casual is filled with mouthbreathers and gamebreaking bugs. enjoy

890,its so fun
891,khhhhtfoooooo
892,"Installed only for Lilith skin, but game seems fun. Might gonna enjoy it more."
893,"the bug fixes are really often and slow fix.
the constant server lag, JP servers are cheap server that goes half lag all the time (during my time in the country). and SEA server sometimes lagging really bad you cant even move properly. 
remember that this is an online game, there is no single player content whatsoever so server connection matters 100% all the time.

aside all things, the people behind the creative teams and game/mechanic designs are superb they carry this industry so friggin hard."
894,i fucking hate this game
895,"Definitely fun to play with friends, despite experiencing many bugs
Also, never queue for rank. EVER"
896,No widescreen support.
897,I only downloaded it to ply the rwby characters. Apparently you have to pay which it didn't say anything before.... Maybe I woulve played longer if I could test it out.  0/10
898,"the base game is fun. However...

There is one word to describe this game and it's neglected.

Server crashers, Toxic players, way WAY overpriced cosmetics (they should be like 1/3rd of the price to even compare to every other free to play games on the market, maybe then this game would make some money)

The current battle pass has ONLY FOUR SKINS, (or crossover pass, whatever you want to call it) it's a whole 15$ which is 1.5x the price of other battle passes in other games that have 5x that amount of skins to earn, just don't do that... either make it cheaper or give more skins

the base game is fun, but that's all it's got going for it... a fun game surrounded by neglect

Also for the love of god nerf Androxus"
899,relly good game
900,good game play
901,legit crashes dont know why got a better pc when i quit not i cant play rip
902,W game
903,quite fun
904,"I recommend this game with a pinch of salt. The gameplay is very fun, Yeah, it's a lot like overwatch, but Mojo isn't anything like Blizzard. Blizzard likes to force players into certain roles or to leap through certain hoops in the name of game balance. Mojo, on the other hand, allows more freedom- You can have teams of full healers if you like. No problem.

No role queue is a bit depressing, but it doesn't really matter. Most champs are fun to play, but unfortunately, the strongest ones are usually a bit boring, like Tyra.

The biggest issue in the game, ignoring Mojo's occasional screwups, (like currently, the sounds are bugged. Sometimes an enemy will just be totally silent. Very unfortunate.) is that the average Paladins player has room temp IQ. You will frequently match up with utterly incompetent players on your team. I don't know why. I don't know where they come from. I sometimes wonder if they're just bots. It's a huge roll of the dice, and makes some matches utterly unfun to play. You can sometimes just steamroll and be bored as you capture whatever objective, or have even less fun and get your ass kicked for ten ish minutes because you have an Androxus and Viktor who can't aim and like to run directly into the enemy.

There is a separate skill-based matchmaking, but it's a lot sweatier, and much more toxic. For simple fun, casual is just better.

Play Paladins for like, two hours. If you like it, stick to it. If you don't like it, trust me, you won't EVER like it.

Also, remember to take breaks now and then. Cheers."

908,"As much as I love this game, the developers approach to things genuinely hurts the game.

The game is currently facing one of the worst game breaking bugs related to audio not playing on tons of abilities, ultimate voice lines, sound effects and so on.

The only thing we've got is a post on the Discord about the issue, the next patch isn't getting any delay despite the fact that releasing a new champion and skins will only add to the problem.

It feels like they're trying to brush any negativity to the game under the rug, I completely get avoiding genuine hate but this is just ridiculous that something so wide spread is being treated almost as if it's just another every day bug.

I just can't recommend the game with the current approach on handling game breaking issues like this, it shines a light on certain areas of development of this game that I don't think is positive."

(P.S. this game will run on a microwave; I used to play this at a stable FPS on a 2013 Macbook Air.)

That being said, there are some things that aren't so great such as visual/audio bugs that have been a problem for literal years. Overall, the good outweighs the bad, and I'd say definitely give it a try if you're curious."

Originally I got this game to play with my friends but after forcing them to play about five games in a row they all decided that they have had enough for the day. My intense desire for Paladin's wasn't satisfied so I moved on to playing by myself for every hour of everyday. I recommend this game if you don't enjoy sleep. On that note please give me back my star slayer ruckus skin, as Hi-Rez Studios and EvilMojo has scammed me for 5 Dollars USD. >:("

935,"The game is terrible and has been terrible since it first came out. 

The matchmaking has never been improved since its launch. I was a returning player entering from a new account, so I basically had minimal hours in the game (with that new account). Turns out, in casual mode (since ranked is stupidly locked behind a minimum requirement of 16 champions, like ok) I get matched with people carrying 500+ hours, all them high cosmetics and stuff who sometimes queue with others. They basically get put against me and other people who have just started. Don't know if Bye-Rez takes into account steam hours, but that is pretty sad.

The game is still and will probably always be a toxic hub to this day. People complaining about other players literally in the lowest of casual queues (i'm talking profiles level 5). This will unfortunately never be fixed, and the reporting function is basically useless.

Hackers. Hackers have been an issue since the first batch of them have been seen in the game. There are aimbotters, wallhackers, booters (match DDoS), you name it. They start from casual profile level 5 matches upwards to when I was in 3000 ELO back in my old account. Btw, I will add that I was part of the problem in ranked as I always played with 1 other friend and we grinded hard as a duo to get up the ranks.

Then I took a long break before recently trying it out again. I try to push myself to enjoy the game still by playing Drogoz and other fun old champions, but I just can't. I'm probably writing this because of the usual losing streaks and lack of teamplay (from my part as well since I know I cannot rely on it at this low rank), but I know others are in my position too. I would suggest just playing a different competitive game."

946,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is"

949,"FOR THE RED VELVET CAKE:
2 and 2/3 cups (295 grams) cake flour (spooned & leveled)
1/4 cup (22 grams) natural unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup (115 grams) unsalted butter softened to room temperature
1 and 3/4 cups (350 grams) granulated sugar
2 large eggs room temperature
1/2 cup (120 ml) canola or vegetable oil
1 (1-ounce) bottle liquid red food color
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
1 and 1/3 cups (320 ml) buttermilk room temperature
FOR THE CREAM CHEESE FROSTING:
12 ounces brick-style cream cheese softened
3/4 cup (175 grams) unsalted butter softened to room temperature
3 cups (360 grams) powdered sugar
1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
INSTRUCTIONS
 
TO MAKE THE RED VELVET CAKE:
Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Spray two 9-inch cake pans well with nonstick cooking spray, line the bottoms of the pans with parchment paper, and set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the cake flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Then sift the dry ingredients to remove any lumps of cocoa powder. Set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large mixing bowl using an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar on medium speed for 4-5 minutes. Add the eggs and mix until fully combined, then mix in the oil, red food color, vanilla extract, and vinegar stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.
Mix in the dry ingredients in three additions alternating with the buttermilk, starting and ending with the dry ingredients. Make sure to mix each addition until just combined and be careful not to over mix the batter.
Evenly distribute the cake batter between the two prepared cake pans and spread the batter around into one even layer. Tap the pans on the counter 2-3 times to remove any air bubbles from the cakes.
Bake at 350°F (177°C) for 28-32 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. Carefully remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool in the pans for 15-20 minutes. Then, carefully remove the cakes from the cake pans and place on the wire rack to cool completely. 
TO MAKE THE CREAM CHEESE FROSTING:
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large mixing bowl using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the butter and mix for about 30 seconds-1 minute until well combined and smooth. 
Mix in the powdered sugar and vanilla extract and continue mixing until fully combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
TO ASSEMBLE THE CAKE:
Level the tops of each cake with a knife or cake leveler. Place one of the cake layers on a cake stand or plate, top with a layer of frosting, and smooth it out into one even layer. Place the second layer on top, then use the remaining frosting to frost the top and sides of the cake.
NOTES
Store leftover red velvet cake in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
Freezing instructions: Cake will freeze well for up to 3 months, thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature. Frosting will also freeze for up to three months, thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature and mix well before frosting the cake.
Buttermilk Substitute: If you don't have any buttermilk on hand, you can use my homemade buttermilk substitute. 
To make a 9x13 cake: Spray a 9x13 pan well with nonstick cooking spray. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it around into one even layer, then bake for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
To make cupcakes: Line 30-32 cavities in muffin pans with cupcake liners, evenly divide the batter between all of the liners. Bake for 15-18 minute or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cupcakes comes out clean. If you prefer fewer cupcakes, you can cut this recipe in half to make 15-16."

965,"A nice alternative to Overwatch, mainly because Overwatch is in a terrible state balance wise, but this game isn't exactly doing as good as we could wish either. 

The graphics are ugly, the music is forgetable, the character's voiceline and personality are generic ,and the game have an identity crisis because the devs keep adding skins that don't looks like the character at all or fit the game's artstyle in the first place. But this isn't much of a problem, for while the game's art is lame, what makes this game shines is it gameplay. 

The game is suprisingly balanced despite it enormous rooster of 56 characters, and you have enormous customisation possibilities for each characters thanks to the shopping system and most importantly the card loadout system. There are many characters that are easy to pick up and hard to master, which make them very interesting to play. As for the game's sound effect, while it is not the best, it's decent enough.

A typical paladin's round is also very dynamic, switching between assault and defense frequently enough, and a Paladin's casual game is usually fairly well balanced. All of this make this game very fun to play and you will easily enjoy this game for many hours. 

However, despite all of this, the game is certainly at it worst right now. The majority of the updates add nothing but dumb skin that will always only really appeal to a niche audience of the community, and they are expensive to get. They also add a load of characters per year, however I noticed that these characters get less and less original and I rarely see people ever picking them up after a couple of weeks after their release. They have not added a single new fresh map for a good year, and the map's pool is very limited at the moment. 

Additionally, competitive mode, is garbage, despite the fact that this is a competitive shooter game. You have to wait an atrocious amount of time for each teams to ""ban"" a character from the rooster one by one, and even then an average competitive game tends to be pretty unbalanced. 

So to conclude this, TL;DR gameplay is really fun, but the updates are lackluster and the art is really not good."

976,no
977,"In my opinion Paladins is the best free to play hero shooter game available. I've played for like six years now and i've always loved it through the ups and downs, the ob64s and all the works, but overall it is a great game! Great characters, customizations (building your own playstyle, + in game items) great maps and great artwork. I love it so much. Good luck to the development team for continuing to optimize our experience and i hope play of the game comes back soon <3"
978,"In this games current state. Can NOT RECOMMEND.. Firstly the balancing is absolutely a joke. Playing with casual players and i'm getting steamrolled by 3 master ranked on the other team. Getting slaughtered 400 to 30 in siege etc. It shouldn't be this hard to balance games, espeically in casual play.

Secondly, the character progression is way to much of a grind. The games been out for years, I shouldn't need 1 billion exp to cap a character. 

lastly, the cosmetics are great but the cost is again a joke. $10 USD for a skin and I cant even choose which one ill get..

I now remember why I always end up uninstalling this game after a few weeks."

980,just plat it

982,"Progression is slow, enemies are generally more skilled than you, grind for days to get new characters, grind even harder to get good with them. But, once the initial frustration goes away, its actually a great game- and very fun with friends. It has its quirks, but overall i say give it a try."
983,"im going to be honest, i dont care what people say about this game. while yes, i def has its flaws, thats kind of what makes it so unique to me. its an unbalanced mess and i love it. its such a nice breather coming from overly competitive games that paladins has been compared to like overwatch or smite. both are still fun, but its annoying to play games and feel forced into a ""meta"" that makes you feel like theres only one way to play the game. where in paladins, i feel like i have the option to have a different experience every game. this latest surprise RWBY crossover only solidified this game as one of my favorite hero shooters out there. i would def recomend this game to anyone who wants a game they dont have to be good at to have fun, or a game that doesnt require a massive skill ceiling. if this game had some major bug fixes and balancing reworks (AHEM vii is so broken rn he is a pub stomping god and needs to be tuned down.) it would be my favorite, but sometimes the no sound glitch or cooldowns lagging can be pretty detering."
984,"Matchmaking for new player is ugly...  i can't have a gave slightly balance... therte is always a team who roll the other...

985,GOOD GAME
986,k
987,"I have been playing since release, the game used to be pretty fun, nice alternative to Overwatch. Problem now is they keep adding tanks that are pretty much mini-bosses and every big patch has an abundance of bugs that just make the game unpleasant to play. As of July update the most annoying bug is where you cant hear the enemy team at all, no footsteps, no gun sounds, no ability sounds... They've had bugs for awhile that kind of did that but now its almost like every game you feel like you have no sound queues and all you can hear is yourself shoot, which i feel like is a form of torture.

10/10 game is 6 years old as of official release and devs still cant figure out how to make the sound work.

TL;DR- Too many champions, too many bugs. 
"
988,dead
989,"This game is pretty fun when things feel balanced, but when they're not, it really shows how bad the developers are at making characters. Some of them are just completely busted and are CLEARLY better than other characters of the same class. If they paid more attention to character balance this would be a main game for me, because when it feels good, it's very fun, but certain match-ups make you want to just exit the application mid match and uninstall this mess of game."
990,"lucruri arme pule gloante copaci femei goale si bani multi rau de tot
"
991,"Main issue with the game is the people running it. Great game depth, mechanics, artstyle(s) and team play, but the constant server issues, login problems, UI issues and bugs keep this from being a top tier game. Wish the devs would do a better job listening to the community than make game changes just for the sake of changing them. Many characters need changes and reworks, but as the community calls for these to at least be tested, the devs dont seem to listen too much or take much of the community impact to heart. 

I'd love to see this game flourish and rival OW(2) but with the state of the team handling it and the various issues it faces, we can only hope the devs find the same love for the game that the community shows

3 - Stupid idiots who pick support and is the ONLY support on the team but decides to run DPS. 
4 - The AMAZING report button for harassment doing JACK SHIT, there mine as well be no such damn thing.

I played and spent money on two accounts and the same shit happens no matter what account I am on, what server I am in and who I play with. Good games are so damn rare it isn't even worth dealing with this queue system OR harassment."

That is just one of the many champions in Paladins. If you are looking for a free version of Overwatch, this is the game for you. There are constant updates to the game with minor bugs. The community is also amazing, for example the Paladins reddit has many enthusiastic players chatting constantly, with people making fan art of characters and much, much more. I would highly recommend any to try the game out, and if you don't like it then you don't have to play it."
1020,"Some say it's a dying game, but personally I think it's great. You still get your salty players, tryhards and what have you, but there are also some really cool people too! The gameplay is solid, it's F2P through and through, and there's enough challenges to keep you busy all season long."

1036,"Here we go. A review of Paladins. Let me preface this by saying I have played Paladins for multiple years. I also took a hiatus during the Pay To Win period.

Would I recommend Paladins: 11%

Yes the game is not perfect and has many, many flaws. But for all of those flaws Paladins still comes out as personally one of the best, if not the best, Free to play game.

Lets start with the champion pool. There are over 56 champions at the time of writing and are all unique to one another. (yes there are assests from other characters in some of these champions but what game/media doesn't take inspiration!). My personal favourites being Mal Damba, a support witch doctor type character with a snake as a weapon and Moji, a flank rabbit character that rides on a two headed lizard creature which shoots fire and projectile spit. That sounds awesome! And trust me. It is awesome!

The maps are varied and all have their benefits, each with their own concepts. The maps are pretty and have many points of attack for tactical takeovers.

The modes in Paladins include, Siege, TDM and Onslaught. Siege is a capture the point and push the payload mix, TDM is TDM lol and Onslaught is Capture and Hold the Point. These modes are very fun and can be enjoyed by many different types of people. The only competitive mode is Siege which makes sense as that is the most tactical and fleshed out mode as it was the base concept for the game.

I could go on for much longer but its wasting valuable time for you to be playing this game. Go and download it. Its freaking amazing. :)"
1037,"sound bug , server lag . 4 oct when overwatch be free this game will die. please stop buy skins they no support any more this game"

I have spent many monies on this because it used to be fun game but now I want my m00nies back because it is no longer playable. I used to be a dota 2 player so I am a very patient person but bugs in this game make me want to call my friend (Texico and Patrick Serminion) and shout mean things at them. pls fix."

Every month they patch bugs and update the meta. People hate on nerfs/buffs but it keeps the game relevant. Overall over the course of years playing the game feels well balanced."
1064,"looking for other hero shooters, this game has game breaking bugs and the devs seem to not care. and tf2 unfortunatly is kinda dead"
1065,"love it, miles better than overwatch"
1066,"if you hate yourself, this game will surely make you happy."
1067,"just did 5 matches, and everyone was a bot?. welp, i'll still gonna play it... might get real players lobby."
1068,yes
1069,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

1071,OVERWATCH WHO????????? (also i want booba ;-;)
1072,good gam
1073,evie is da shit
1074,"4k 21:9 doesnt work
graphics ehh 🤮
amount of skins that are sold compared to quality of the game is a joke

and yes its a poor copy of overwatch 
"
1075,"The champions are cool, and the game is fairly balanced when you compare it to other hero shooters / mobas.

Game is absolutely filled with bugs.
-ui breaking
-bad collision / map geometry
-graphics not loading properly
-awful latency that ruins alot of ability matchups

The map geometry is a big one depending on what hero you play. Source games and overwatch may not have the most intuitive movement mechanics, but once you do learn the logic, they're pretty consistent. With paladins it feels like you have to memorize how each individual polygon on the maps interacts with your character. Learning rollouts honestly just isn't as fun as it should be."
1076,"this game is so stupid! 
imbalance af"
1077,thumbs up
1078,"Even after all these years the game still feels like it's in Beta. It IS however a very unique concept of a game compared to other hero shooters. But there are too many negatives to this that out weigh the positives. The bugs in the game stay for way too long. The game is free to play, but the devs worry about quantity over quality. Devs don't really listen to the player base for feedback as well. In my opinion, if you really still love this game. Wait till they fix the sound issue over the game not being optimized enough to load things in. Even then, the devs still take too long to fix game breaking issues. The title card of their next patch is a new champion as well, instead of addressing the game breaking issue that is the sound bug."
1079,"Played this game for a few hours now, reminds me of the Nickelodeon browser games, but to be fair I did enjoy those games. The Cartoon Network browser games were fun too, especially the Regular Show game. Would recommend this game if you are above the age of 56 and have both type 1 and type 2 diabetes."
1080,it good
1081,very n i c e

im playing this game 2 years"
1095,yes
1096,"I used to play the game a lot especially in beta without steam client. Decided to come back for nostalgia purposes. I was greeted with lag, multiple game breaking bugs (game not booting up properly, some characters being muted sometimes including my own) and game looking a lot more cash grabby then back then. At least hey got rid of p2w card mechanic that made me leave last time."
1097,"The game is fun to play! It would be better if queue time is shorter.
I have decent internet but it takes forever to launch the game."
1098,"Cool game, I like to play it with my friend"
1099,Good if you like bugs 👌
1100,i get told to go see a doctor by teamate in ranked and i should stop playing when he has a level 326 bombking and hes still shit at the game. Actaul no life hes the one that sohuld go see a doctor LMFAOOO
1101,Game is Good
1102,literally the free version of overwatch (love it)

1105,"Got a new skin, couldn't hear it due to game bugging out happens almost all the time"
1106,fuck this
1107,torvaldbooty
1108,honestly i hated this game for along time thinking it was a cheap rip off of overwatch but when the rwby cross over cameout being a weeb i had to check it out just to buy the rwby content the first thing i notice is its super ugly the loading screen and game graphics are just gross outdated. but over all its fun there are way more champions and the customization card for items were really cool how ever i think the having to buy each champion sucks seeing it takes like 8 hours to get the gold for one. ive played about 100 hours of overwatcch and truthfully now i look at it as palidians is on the same grounds as overwatch and if they were bankrolled the game would be way better then overwatch there for i think its worth the try
1109,"(Playtime not indicative of total -- around 30+ additional hours on other platforms.)

Paladins is honestly such a wonderful game. A lot of people just call it an Overwatch clone, but it has a lot of things that Overwatch doesn't. The character designs are incredibly unique and well done and the voice acting is superb. There are a handful of similarities in abilities between the games, but I honestly feel like Paladins has pulled off those concepts better. 

I have well over 600+ hours on Overwatch and eventually gave it up due to the overly toxic community and general mood drops when playing. It wasn't fun to me anymore. I gave Paladins a try a few years ago and I fell in love with it from first play. I'd DEFINITELY recommend it to anybody who loves the competitive hero-shooter genre but is looking for a unique, high-fantasy take on it!"
1110,Raum.
1111,"Great game, Very poorly optimised and highly buggy with the devs showing 0 interest in fixing it"
1112,fun but buggy af
1113,hello everyone!! its me thegamingsam this game is just crazy!! totally reccomend dis game to all of my loyal fans out there in dis crazy world!! keep gaming my hot gaymers!! xxxx

1128,"Sound bugs remain for weeks and still not fixed
"
1129,"Sometimes you get your ass kicked, sometimes you kick their ass. There's no in between."
1130,"This game used to be so good. Now it is very *censored due to obscene language*. Hey you, yeah you person who is in charge of updates and bug fixes. You have been doing such a *censored due to obscene language* job at Paladins.

Game-breaking bugs don't have immediate fixes and usually last for the entirety of the patch. Things like champions crashing the game simply by existing. Game-changing ultimate abilities that have very obvious indicators and sound queues becoming silent thus making the game literally unplayable.

FIX THE *censored due to obscene language* GAME HI-REZ!!!!!!!!!!!!! STOP DISTRACTING THE PLAYERS WITH MEDIOCRE AND SUB-PAR PATCHES... WITH OVERWATCH 2 JUST AROUND THE CORNER, YOUR GAME WILL DIE FASTER THAN IT SHOULD."
1131,"The game is fun with friends and when it works.
Too bad the game doesn't work with bugs every patch and bugs that have not been patched since way before.
I respect the release of new content periodically but god damn with new patches comes new bugs and the same old bugs and server issues."
1132,Devs are great at choosing their priorities. Sound bugs? Broken quest rewards? Laggy Asia servers? They'll get to it at some point. Cash shop not working? Fixed the next day.
1133,"After spending hundreds of dollars into the game, it just gets worse and worse every year and the developers only ever give the bare minimum every blue moon. 

Bugs, horrible servers, r*pey community are just one of the many things that make this game bad. Don't waste your time on it"
1134,i booted up the game and a skinwalker appeared. 10/10
1135,Fun.
1136,yes
1137,"good game, but I have a few nitpicks, for reference: I played this for about 600 hours or so on the switch, played every event, and have made it to Platinum in ranked several times:
- some matchs lag an unbearable amount (for example sake, I have a multi router setup for blazing speeds, meaning it's 100% bad netcode, or just people with badwifi either or, it does make it annoying to play sometimes, this is more noticeable on console, it runs far better on pc, but the spikes are still seen every now and again)
- the battle pass's take a extraordinary long time, reason for this is so you feel like spending money, but god I feel as if it was taken too far, mind you I'm the type of person who loves a good grind, but this? it's approximately 4-6 matchs with boosters and all wins, to level up once... the time it takes to level up is downright annoying without the boosters, leading to the player not feel like they want to play anymore. I recommend playing in a party to get that slight boost as it makes it far more bearable. it's always a long grueling crawl either way. dont get me wrong, this could be rectified if the rewards at each level were something good, and made the player feel like it's something worth grinding for, but most of them from every battle pass have not been anything worth while to keep someone invested, other then a few profile pictures, and the skins.

Other then the two nitpicks, games not bad, worth a try if you haven't played before, I mean it's free nothings stopping you from trying it at least. a hero is added almost every update, and are decently balanced usually etc.

Something I don't play often anymore since all they do is make skins rather than fix their game wouldn't reccomend unless your a bit bored."
1151,100x times better than Shitterwatch. Stop giving Blizzard money please.

I gochu bro... Paladins! 10 out of 10 psychiatrist would recommend. No seriosly, it's a wicked, cursed game... but I LOVE IT! There is drama, comedy, good moments, bad moments, all up's and down's... But in current state, definitly... 10/10!"
1166,pretty poggers
1167,"Honestly a really fun game, haven't been able to qualify for ranked yet but casual is loads of fun.

Furia/Zhin Main, And the amount of support i get in games is the same as my family, zero.

However it's pretty fun to 1v3 every encounter and being a damage healer means i get a TON of hate."
1168,"Disable alt+f4? I'll keep task manager open on my other monitor and kill it from there. Waste of time when Skye and Lex are both broken as all hell. Good to know you can fully model the character's asses too, classy."
1169,"I loved this game. I used to play it when I was mad at/done with Overwatch. It was like the fun version of Overwatch that I could get on and goof around with and just have fun on. They have absolutely RUINED this game. They have this stupid anti-healing mechanic that renders tanks and healers 100% useless. You literally start a game with 30% anti-healing and end up with 90% anti-healing about 1/3 - 1/2 way through the game. Tanks don't stand a chance and healers are literally useless. I am uninstalling the game until they fix that mechanic, it literally makes the game unplayable."
1170,"As of the most recent update, EAC support on Linux (which was working previously) no longer works. Please fix this."
1171,Its good but i definityly fee; theres too many basic shooter charectors that ware way too op like tyra and VII
1172,Seems like its full of speed hackers and bots. Really could be a cool game if they'd halfway attempt to balance it.
1173,paladins its a great game but no one talks about it
1174,cool and good
1175,I love being able to shoot highly inteligent tigers with miniguns in this game

1188,"Having a good time playing some new heroes a while back. Yagorath gets introduced. OP beyond all recognition for way too long. How is it ""fixed""? If you think ""oh, they would nerf some of it's capabilities that people are exploiting,"" you would be horribly wrong. Instead what we get are new characters to break the OP characters from before. The kicker? The new ones are even more OP. There is no real fixing. It's just lazily introducing more broken characters until the whole scene in every match is just the most exploitable characters with broken card setups.

A falling JENGA tower is more stable than this game."

1213,"yes
"
1214,gud.
1215,"It's insanely unbalanced and the MMR in quickmatch goes by player level so you can't play with long time friends if you're new. Not one I could recommend right now. Also the insanely loud match notification when you're tabbed out has been a known bug for years and devs still haven't fixed it so it's likely they don't care about the small bugs over making in game purchases and lootboxes. 
"
1216,"VERY FUN I FELL OUT OF THE MAP 22 TIMES DUE TO A REALLY BIG BIG BIG RED KNIGHT MAN YEETING ME INTO ANOTHER WORLD!!! 17/apple

1217,"Amazing Free to Play game with lots of characters, events, play styles and more! It is a 5v5 team battle with different game modes like king of the hill, team death match, push the payload, and other event game modes, the game does allow you to collect premium currency over time so you can dress your favorite heroes in the coolest skins. The game has been out for quite a while now and has tons of time put into it by the dev team to balance and rebalance and present new and fun ideas. Updates are regular and new crossover content has been very fun. I hope you will give it a try! The community is mostly friendly and its a fun casual game you can play with friends or fam, but if you care for the competitive aspect then you can enter the ranked arena and grind to your hearts content."
1218,"dis game is really fun! i like that its a competitive game but the gameplay is relaxed, i dont feel underpreassure and i can just have fun! also theres a good amount of characters so you can find the perfect one for you, its really beginner friendly also! 💗"
1219,"The servers are unfortunately pretty low quality but other than that I'd say it's an excellent game.

Other than that my only real criticism is the lack of balance in certain cases, ex. Tyra being game-breakingly strong and easy to play.

Still fun though, and it's free."

1251,"devs don't pay attention where it counts. hitboxes are really bad, bugs go unchecked and are really bad and the game is overall very unbalanced."
1252,bounty hunter is the best
1253,Makoa is in fact a champion.
1254,"With this game, you get what you pay for. As you can tell, this game is free, therefore I leave plenty of room for leniency, but that does not mean that it cannot be criticized fairly. The game feels like it is still in its Beta version, yet you can find yourself spending upwards of $100 or more, which I find inoffensively inappropriate. There are multiple instances of imperfections that should not be in a years-old, active game, especially in such a competitive space for this genre; minor visual and audio bugs that are too clear to ignore, and overall lack of polish in graphics and gameplay are the biggest flaws this game ought to fix (some were not even present in the Beta!). These things, combined with several out-of-place design choices and some other poor aspects of the game, make it seem like there is a lack of passion and care put in this otherwise fun and unique experience. All in all, I would still recommend this game because it is free and I have enjoyed it quite a bit through the years. I wish the game and its creator a bright and prosper future :)"
1255,i hate this game and it gives me pain and yet i spend money

1260,"It's janky but very much fun. I used to love Overwatch and this fills that void pretty well. Training/bots are a good, casual way to just have some fun and pass time. It's characters varies in playstyles and themes, also being able to play them in different ways. Plus Supports and Tanks being ACTUALLY FUN to play being able to do some damage if played well. There is something for everyone!! Also crossplay if you want to play with more people and worry about not finding a game"

1269,"Paladins is a game that you don't play. It. Plays. You. You should be honored that such a game as great as this exists within our timeline. With its global ""Glorious Ascension"" patch that the game is set to receive, players will be able to transform the game into a true sports simulation. Who knows? They may even get creative and get you to play in the annual North American Paladins Hoops Tournament. But the real prizes are for the creators of the game to create a reality show around Paladins that has some of the best players in the world competing. How could anyone say no to that?

The game is owned by Hi-Rez Studios, who recently celebrated their 10th birthday. One of the originators of the Smite franchise, Hi-Rez have some solid hits under their belt, including the free-to-play team-based shooter Warframe. However, Paladins has been Hi-Rez Studios' biggest hit to date, with its sequel League of Legends style roster system and the frenetic movement of its world creating a kind of free-flow of destruction. I personally am a big fan of this game, and it's a one-two punch of creativity for Hi-Rez Studios. While Warframe does have it's fair share of fans, Paladins has many more players and has received several high-profile partnerships that could potentially help it grow in the coming months."
1270,its pretty fun as a free overwatch but overwatch is still better

1280,"Servers aren't that stable, aimbot are everywhere, matchhmaking is fucked, and the payload part of the game is a waste of time since it only gives point to the attack team, meaning that if the defence team win it's just back to capture the point without anything changed. For F2P chapions cost quite a bit of gold, but once you got them all there's nothing to use it on since except one (that's just a basic recolor) skins are paid only, either in lootboxes or in a season pass.
Otherwise game can be fun, when you get fair match, but usually expect to have a team just dominate the other."
1281,super fun game.
1282,This game is awesome
1283,absolute dogshit game. ripoff of an already shitty ass game.
1284,"DUCK YOU

1285,One of the most enjoyable games i have ever played!!!!!
1286,Very fun and easy to understand
1287,"this game sucks, completely bootleg version of overwatch, and its SUPER easy. i have yet to lose a match on xbox. everyone who plays this game online is incompetent. if you have an IQ above 70 you will win every match with at least a 10 kill streak, and so will the rest of your team. you know how in other games, it feels like the enemy team is super coordinated and good while your team is shit? this game inverts that. I have never faced a good enemy team"
1288,it might be a overwatch ripoff but its still amazing
1289,"good game play
free over watch
love the characters
some bugs about the emots and chats
story is...weak
servers.....kinda need help
awsome skins

1306,"There are some games in which you can pull ahead of your team and still dominate for a time, especially if you are good at said game. For example, CSGO and COD were games where you could pull of these stunts. Paladins, however, is not one of those games! This is truly a team-based FPS and coordination wins every time. I have played with my bros as a squad and I have played with randoms, the difference in how the matches turned out were night and day in comparison. The squads we faced seemed like premade squads, as their movement and hero choices were balanced and effective. You will find yourself in matches that are difficult more often than not, which is a good thing......if you also have a coordinated squad. I can't tell you how frustrating it is to watch your teammates race ahead and split off, each thinking they can take the entire enemy squad alone. This mentality must come from those previously mentioned FPS games where that might work, but all it results in here is almost certain defeat. 

Having said all that, this game is fun to play and offers a large list of heroes to play, each with their own unique abilities and weapons. I like the choices given to you and at the time when I bought it, the battle pass that unlocked the entire roster of heroes was much cheaper than other games would rob you for. Levels were good and offered multiple angles of attack, modes were challenging and interesting too. I don't really have much bad things to say about this game except that in some rare cases I experienced server issues (not sure if they are better or worse now) and solo queue in this game can be a nightmare if you have a squad that doesn't communicate, but this isn't all the time. So all in all, I recommend this game."
1307,Feels like TF2 but it's not. It's lighter thats thats good. and RWBY is there si I can see why not have this game.
1308,Gud Fun Game

1324,"What is Paladins? Excellent question random voice in my head formed by schizophrenia. Paladins is a 5v5 fps game which draws heavy inspiration from similar titles such as Overwatch. Some characters feel very similar to the original and some are basically a straight copy, but the game has a lot more characters making it some what more enjoyable and the introduction of new characters every couple months is a big upgrade to that of overwatch. There's not much story here, its mostly just about getting your team mates together and then having fun with them in PvP mode or the PvE missions, though there will be plenty of options for those who wish to get into the storyline as well Paladins Review – A New Challenger My first impressions were somewhat positive but the negatives overshadowed that fact that this title was quite different than anything I have played before so far, even the other shooter titles like Halo or Call of Duty games didn't come close to comparing to the level of detail that Paladins had on display. The game is an MMOFPS and it shows, with every new map we saw and more in-game screens than we can count at this point the developers are getting more and more polish into their title, and we are all very much for it! I am personally a fan of the new graphics, but I'm not really happy with how they handle the armor models and weapons, since they're just so bad in my opinion; they look like some of them are made out of cardboard. Also, there's this ""shiny"" effect on the guns, making it seem very cheap and plastic-y to me... Also, this is not really the first time that this game has had this problem (as far as I know), so I think that it'd be good if they could fix it because right now it seems like they're not really trying hard at all to fix it... I think that the weapons should be better modeled too, though I do prefer the ""old"" way of modeling them, while I can understand why they decided to go with the new ones, I still think that they need to make a few tweaks here and there to get the best result, especially when we're talking about such a big change like this... They are using something called ""Voxel"" technology, which means they are literally making each element of the weapon/armor/thingie out of thousands upon thousands of tiny cubes. This gives it a very organic and realistic feel in terms of how it would actually look when you were holding it or looking at it with your eyes up close (in game). It is also being done to get around the fact that this game is on console and not PC/PC-like, where everything would have to be modeled individually, scaled, textured etc, so it makes sense that they used the voxel tech here because it allows them to create an entire weapon/armor/thingie in one go, instead of having to model each part individually.  It was cool but I’m not so sure I like the way the character looks – he has a weird head shape and seems too short for his size (if you look at the picture above). I think the legs are too skinny compared to how big the rest of him is, and the torso is just too long, making him seem even shorter than he already is (which would be understandable if the body were wider). And then the arms look really weird and stiff, almost like rubber limbs.

1325,HEY  u got a game in ur buggy mess!!!!
1326,got it for the RWBY crossover stayed for a amazing game plus its free and im broke
1327,it too fun raum+ pocket pip = overpowered
1328,the game is bullshit i had bought a battle pass and then nearly completed it and all my items are now gone i contacted support for help and they said it was not registered which is bullshit and i sent proof that i had it registered and then they said we are not going to fix your account nor are we going to give you back your items like i said the game is bullshit the dev team is bullshit and the support is bullshit dont play the game its not worth the aggrovation the support team made me wait 6 days till they said no go screw yourself if i could id sue but i cant like i said dont even play the game its not worth it
1329,Since you have removed the 3rd person mode this game turned into a sht. I want to see the entire skin just I bought. Bring the 3rd person mode back. You said about this removal: Whenever we released new content to game we have to fix issues cause of the 3rd person mode. But sir.. hm.. THIS IS YOUR F. WORK. What the hell are you doing in the developing branch then??
1330,it's good :)
1331,Server Bad
1332,GOOD
1333,"A 5 year old unreal engine 3 game with 3 game modes and about 8 or 9 maps in total, with graphics that are in the PS1.5-PS3 range, with glitches that kill the game back when it was released 5 years ago, and not only those persist today, more and more glitches arise and the developers do nothing about it, sending them countless emails for getting banned multiple times for merely being matched to a game, and they just keep asking me for the same information and files over and over again, until I give up. It used to be playable, but right now they're just focusing on selling new skins as if they were brand new champions when they're just skins, not fixing anything, not making graphics less dated and not making new maps. Such a good concept but with the worst execution possible. Matchmaking is also clearly manipulated so that people who don't pay for the battle pass constantly lose, this is a 5 VS 5 player game and I have had lose streaks of 7 or 8 games in a row, with ""random"" people. In addittion the Spanish translation, up to a few days ago, has always been done via translator. Now all of a sudden the translation makes sense (after 5 years of release), but you cannot hide the Sun with a finger."
1334,great ppl playing great game ;d
1335,"Its overwatch but free which is bad for ow2
"
1336,"I re installed the game because i want to spend some time on it, and I decided it was time to make a quick review.
Shame there is no option for a mixed review.

The game is great gameplay is fluid and many champions are available.
Visuals are great no problem on this side too.

The big problem in the game itself is the community. I have never seen so much toxicity in a video game.
For ex. You are losing a match despite playing good and ""teammates"" flames you left and right and think are always superior to you.
In comparison, community on OW is much more firendly and polite and i thought it was the other way around.

Better to play with friends (I have none lol), otherwise stay the f*** out of this game."

1376,"""We have overwatch at home"" speaking as a pro overwatch player after playing this game I can really appreciate the intricacies of a game as poorly made as this one and I love it. When I don't have the high stakes competitive drive it takes to play a game such as overwatch, paladins is there to save my ego. When I want to shit on nerds after getting shit on by even worse nerds I will always turn to paladins. When I want to kill myself due to throwing Emongg's games in overwatch, I will gladly come to paladins and never feel bad about playing poorly because anyone who plays this game deserves nothing."
1377,Very fun game
1378,Really bad
1379,Easy to follow instructions for game play.  Can play with friends or join a pick-up group.  A variety of character types to play.  I love the new RWBY skins.
1380,"A crapy game with devs that can't make maps, game modes, new interesting heroes. It started good. But turned out to be a stinky piece of...paladins. No battle pass if you don't pay? Why not give some reward to all players? Stupidly high numder of recolored skins? Events that don't make any sence? Bugs like ""your daayly quest will reset in about 2000 days""? This game is close to being dead."
1381,"Almost 3000 hours in this game, let me add my spices.

Short summary. Do not get this game. Do not spend a
single dime on this in it's current state. Go jack off instead, 
least you'll have done something more meaningful than
playing this mess.

Now to the game:

Is it fun? Most of the time it was, sure.

 What changed   /  did    not   change?

 Let me show it to you in a simplified 
list, below that a more in depth explanation.

Good list:

54 unique champions

Very big variety of gameplay styles posslbe

skins, voices included

maps look good aswell, fun to play on


Nono list:

Heavy game breaking bugs

Insanely overpriced crystals

bad servers

very toxic community (at least in ranked)

unbalanced matches (again, refereing to ranked)

hackers roaming free

vgs system lag (e.g. you say hi with vvgh, 
see the text message, expect the voice line to be played 10 seconds later)

chests overpriced for a high chance to get a skin you dont want

no possibility to actually buy skins you are interested in

ui looks outdated and goes back to early beta stages
 (and even then it looked better than this mess)

They still did not add push the payload mode, 
in other words not listening to community at all

not fixing bugs but rather pushing out 100th
 skin for maeve no one asked for

battlepass:
even if you play like a lunatic it takes ages
 for you to actually complete the battlepass

no new maps being released

ranked system total mess

not able to team up in ranked with more than 2 ppl
after reaching diamond rank


In depth explanation of the problems:

Game breaking bugs:

   currently most champions dont make any sound.
 You heard right, you are not able to hear any gunshots,
 ultimates from what i think random champions at all. 
Furia shooting her beam from somewhere? 
good luck try to figure out where it comes from.

some talents not working e.g. grovers legendary cards not working at all.

Let's take a look at their  crystal store.
It costs 7.99€ for 400 crystals. let it sink in for a moment.
how much do you think most of the chests costs?
300-400 crystals. So, in order for me to get a skin
that i like i have to pay at least 8€. Hey, i mean i get it,
it takes time and effort to produce those things. What
pisses me off the most is the fact that you pay 8€ for a chance.
you know how many items there are in a diamond chest? 219
and 300 crystals worth opening. Never played maeve before?
fuck you pal, now you get a meave skin, even though you dont play her.
good job, you just spent 6€ on something you obviously did not want.
you want to actually buy a certain skin with your money?
fuck you pal, go open a chest instead, or even better, dont offer the skin
in the first place. you see paladins has this ground breaking feature where
even if you want to buy a skin you are not able to since they are
limited to battle passes long gone. like 2 years passed. it's basically like in 
a strip club. See but dont touch, Why all of it? no idea, lets move on.

Servers occasionally crashing, lagging, nothing much to say

You didnt perform like a god in ranked? report
your game crashed because of this code disaster paladins? report
you got a real life and not always 25 min for a single match? report
Basically everything you do you get reported for. Got a different 
opinion on anything? report
enemy team is simply better? well fuck you all you trashes you get
reported. 
This is basically the state of ranked right now.
Does reporting do anything? who knows, maybe it's just some kind
of stress relief button...

Dont you love it when you play like a god, and you still lose tp?
Thanks to the great matchmaking system of paladins you get
people in your team with 50 hours playtime when you have 
almost 3000. fun, not.

hackers are pretty self explenetory. you get nuked by viktor
auto aim, nothing new.

Talked about the chests already so i'll keep it short:
You pay an overpriced amout for shit you dont want.
You have to though, otherwise stay like the skinless
peasent you are.

The ui is a total mess. A lot of features cramped into
tiny spaces where you have to look with a magnifying
glass to find the things you want. Guess its easier to
leave this horrible mess of a ui than to just invest some
time for an actual good looking and user friendly
interface. Maybe we'll get it 2050 or something, being
optimistic though.

push the payload mode was one of the og modes be-
sides cap the point and push. But nah, fuck the comm-
unity, lets add koth and team deathmatch. stale game-
play and shit barely anyone asked for.

the game breaking bugs i listed earlier? they've been
here for a few months. yes, game breaking bugs. You'd
think they'd be able to afford devs to actually fix this 
with these insane prices they require you to pay, but 
i highly doubt that anyone is even paying bare minimum
for the content in this game, easily fixable, but keep going
like this hi rez. Highway to hell am i right?

Before there were test maps you could play. They were
incredibly fun, new approach, looked great and were
extremely fun to play on. Where'd they go? eaten by
yagorath maybe

and at last the ranked system. the absolute biggest
time waste of your life. You see paladins handles your rank
like this,
You lose, you lose tp. you win, you gain tp. simple.
you are way better than everyone in the match, but your
team still loses? you lose tp
someone in your team crashes and you lose? -tp here we go
someone intentionally goes afk? bye bye tp
Its basically gambling at this point.
your skill does not equal your rank. only the times your team
won or lost makes you look better or not. you could be abso-
lute shit but get carried by your team. gj, you became diamond
for literally doing nothing.

got friends who are diamond or above? well screw you pal,
only 2 ppl in one party can go ranked, lol

10/10 would recommend"
1411,Fun game
1412,"Handful of characters holding a consistent meta while other characters holding unique gimmicks lacking any capability to play the game whatsoever. Trash ass game, do not play!"
1413,"Im having fun ngl. I wish mmr was a bit more balanced but Ive never played a game that had good mmr or had it implemented correctly. My main issue is the bugs and the lack of attention the dev team gives them. I understand its hard and I understand that they do try to fix them, but browsing through forums to see the people talk about the same bugs Im experiencing is a little unexceptable. Overall its a great game that just needs a bit more polish.
Also, please remove Viktor :) He adds nothing to the game but pain, you guys already removed another character, ya'll can do it with him"
1414,Blizzard has been beating overwatch to death with an aluminum baseball bat meanwhile hi-rez has actually been working to drastically improve their hero shooter over the past half decade.
1415,W free overwatch
1416,Wooooh Whoooooo!!
1417,fun ig
1418,.
1419,nice
1420,overwatch for poor people
1421,hell no
1422,.
1423,Good tIme with friends.
1424,"shit

1425,"Fun game, but it seems to have waaaaaay too much ""give me money"" vibes."
1426,yes
1427,si
1428,overwatch but low quality and hot woman
1429,it might not look good but once you play it you might change your mind about it
1430,shitty game broken unbalanced steals everything from every other game
1431,"I used to play this game for the longest time imaginable, but after i got to know the community a bit better I realised just how toxic a lot of the people are. I stuck with it cuz I found some friends along the way, thus making the game enjoyable. For anyone wanting to get into Paladins, do so, try it out and see if you like it. But if I had to Describe the game rather simply, I would say this: 
-The Gameplay: it has gotten over the years really similiar to Overwatch, even some of the Champions have similiar ablities
-The Community: just f#ck me, genuinely, it is as bad as League of Legends and i never even played League
In a nutshell, the game CAN be fun, it just isn't most of the time mainly due to the bad balancing and one of the most horrific matchmaking i've ever seen. I'm talking a GM playing against someone who just installed the game. 
I haven't played this game actively since last year so I don't really know exactly how the state of the game is now. Like I already said, if you wanna give this game a shot go for it, but i strongly recommend not to."
1432,Maybe I'm just a masochist but its an enjoyable game despite the matchmaking being total hell.
1433,Stupid game where you can't exit to lobby from match.
1434,"You're either steam rolled by people who have unlocked everything before you, or you steam roll people who don't even know how to play the game. It's sad."

1436,it doesnt let me enter
1437,"An awesome hero shooter with tons variability from the amount of characters, their talents, and the card system. The mid match item shop and the other systems I mentioned do take a little figuring out but the game is way more rewarding than others in the genre because of this. The game has always had a diverse cast of characters and the expansion of the roster continues at a pretty good pace with 3-4 characters a year. The last couple years they have really landed on a consistent art style for the game and it really has a much better sense of cohesiveness because of this. With that the quality of character skins have really increased as well. A good chunk of this game is building a character to the way you like to play them and/or making them efficient as possible. This aspect may not be for everybody but I find it quite enjoyable, being able to tinker with a character and solve a puzzle of how to get this character to play the way I want. 

It is not without it flaws with it being essentially a AA release there comes a little bit of jank and bugs and some quality of life issues. The game feel could be a bit tighter but I think overall its good, the characters function well but some do encounter bugs or strangeness more than others. Most of the time these bugs are sound related. With it being a team driven game when somebody leaves its pretty much game over as a crappy bot will take over. This isn't a fault of the game but more so the genre of game. People leaving or disconnecting happens a little too frequently at times and it can be frustrating. 

In conclusion, this game is amazing when you have a full five people working together against another team working with each other. If all the people in the game know how the game works and its systems the high you get from this is something you don't get in most other games. But you will encounter some bumps in the road when trying to chase this high. But be patient with it and you will be rewarded with a truly unique and satisfying experience. Paladins is a diamond in the rough, a flawed gem. 
"
1438,"it is a very good game, and I recommend it to competitive players."
1439,"SERVER SEA IS LIKE SHITTTTTTTTTTTT, CANT PLAY SHHITTTTTTTTTTTTTT, KEEP DISCONNECTING ALL THE TIMEEE, PING STABLE BUT VERY LAGGYYYY AND UNPLAYABLEEEE. PLSS HI REZZZZZ FIX THIS GAMEEEEE OR ILL QUIT PLAYING

THANKYOU!"

1446,overwatch but without sex
1447,"You might say that this is just F2P Overwatch, and you aren't wrong. But I personally think that its better"
1448,muito brabo!!!
1449,ban azaan in ranked and dont play skye
1450,"Zarini says that this is a very good game and has a rly good AC against cheaters. 
I fully agree with him, i really enjoy that game :)
"
1451,love its so fun i can play it for HOURS!!!!!<3333
1452,yes
1453,good
1454,Worst game in existence please avoid at all costs. Servers are dogshit and devs do not have brains. Devs please delete the game and start selling ice cream because that is all you will be good for. Also never develop another game ever. Quit developing and just give up.
1455,L
1456,gud game very nice
1457,I am glad there was a RWBY crossover. Otherwise i would have never seen this cool game!
1458,"i been playing this game since june of 2016. i probably have 4000-4500 hours of playtime on the hirez launcher. this game has made me mentally disabled. i now have to take medication to cope with the after effects of this game. this game used to be fun in 2016 but then the devs ho-rez studios slowly killed it. i recommend this game if you are a true masochist. i do not recommend this game if you enjoy keeping your sanity. i suffered everyday playing this game, with its plethora of bugs and its dis-functionality. Androx reversal? hasnt worked for 6 years. they add horribly designed characters that excess in disgusting spam and no skill involved. shalin fps bug has been a thing for longer than i have been alive. no one likes timber mill, delete it. the servers are literally worse than ridley in smash ultimate.
              In conclusion. this game sucks it used to be good but not anymore. avoid at all costs. do not install it. think of the wellbeing of your family and children.

1459,Fun game not P2W
1460,really nice game but if you have the money to buy overwatch buy it
1461,"HONESTLY it's much better than I expected. Not as high visual fidelity as Overwatch, and it currently has some annoying audio bugs, but 55 champions and relatively tight gameplay? It's actually really fun! There's also flexibility where every champion has 3 talents to change how they focus, a card loadout system that you can premake for each champion (with some preset loadouts), and in game items to buy with money earned while fighting, there's actually a lot of variety with playing repeatedly. So yeah, not a meme anymore, legit fun video game."
1462,Its like a free version of overwatch and its worth it
1463,Trash game with trash developers
1464,Paladins doesn't get the credit it is due. I love the flexibility of the characters with the card system and trait systems. the unique game modes that spring up occasionally are fun distractions.
1465,"Good Overwatch Clone (:

1466,"very good game plus boobies make me smile

1469,the people half the time AFK every round and on top of that 1/4 of the characters are absolutely 100% broken and 1 shot all day long...your matchmaking is a joke putting no lifers against people that literally havent touched the game in years absolutely awful experience one of the worst i would rather play a game on the sega genesis than this.
1470,no.
1471,"good
"
1472,"nice
"
1473,"Needs better MMR, I just got the game as level 1 and they are matching me against teams of level 40s. For a new player just starting all you will go against are people who been rotting on this game so you don't even get a chance to learn. Not new player friendly and it's pay 2 win, people can just buy the best characters and have a massive advantage. Let's not forget about the black screen of death that crashes your game every other match. Hackers are rampant, I would say every other match because the player base is so small."
1474,"-this game is shit
-server support by potato
-unbalanced

i just play this fucking thing because it collab with RWBY 
don't waste your money and time like me"
1475,"I have a long history with Hi-Rez Studios who are, in my opinion, in the top three of worse publishers ever to exist. When you see the name Hi-Rez Studios, you should be thinking of companies such as, Electronic Arts, Activision, Ubisoft, and Blizzard; you've been warned."
1476,goooood
1477,"Not Great, Not terrible, kind of free Overwatch"
1478,:)
1479,"This is a shit game, please do not even think of playing it, even though it's free. It's been out for years and there's still countless bugs and server issues. Imagine playing on 500 ping in a ranked game or even casual. Just not worth it. I'd say even Candy Crush is a better game than this shit show."
1480,"Excellent team-based game play with vibrant colors and graphics accompanied with unique abilities and characters. the game runs perfectly on even the most primitive of setups. Only issue is that there are only a few basic game modes, I would really like to see a few LTMs and some difficult challenges with actually good rewards. Overall though, great game."
1481,"Paladins can be defined in a single sentence. 
Good game, but shitty and fktard server.
NEW SEASON, NEW FUCKED UP OFC!"
1482,Yo what the hell is wrong with the SEA Server lags
1483,"fun game

1484,"Love the different play styles with each class/character.
The game could use a lot of changes but overall a good game and I enjoy it."
1485,very good very nice sexy banana
1486,its an amazing competitive game
1487,Still better than overwatch
1488,Don't play you will quickly rack up many hours
1489,Great
1490,"This game is definitely a good game overall. Great character designs, etc. Their battle passes are kinda weird but overall they are pretty decent at balances and bug fixes with each update. Played when it first released and recently got into the PC side of it."
1491,This game promotes gambling. Horrid thing to do when their community are primarily younger ages.
1492,"Me: ""I think I will play as a Flanker today.""

Team: **Instantly locks into DPS/Flanker rolls and one Guam**

Me: ""... Healer it is then.""

5 minutes later

Androxius: ""WHY ARE YOU NOT HEALING ANYONE!?""

Me: ""I AM BUT YOU KEEP DYING THE MOMENT I DO BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU CAN TANK THE ENTIRE ENEMY TEAM ALONE.""

Skye: ""You should probably be healing the tank a bit more, tho.""

Me: ""THE TANK IS IDLE!!!""

Post-Game

Androxius: ""Wow, terrible Furia. Bad Furia. What's this? 36,000 healing? Terrible for Furia. You should stop playing.""

Me: ""I would have done more healing if you DIDN'T KEEP CHARGING IN ALONE.""

Androxius and Skye: ""BAD HEALER BAD HEALER BAD HEALER BAD HEALER!!!""

Corvus on the enemy team: ""dude leave them alone, they did fine.""

Me: ""...""


And ever since that day I have been a loyal servant to the Magistrate empire. All hail our glorious empire and death to all who stand against us."
1493,This game makes me want to say slurs
1494,I ENJOY IT
1495,it's fun
1496,"Same randomly reset my account back to having no skins, no characters, no levels. Nothing. Support didn't help so it's in the dumpster"
1497,goodfd
1498,"Game is still fun so many years later since the original Alpha and Beta. I love it more than the similar games (ex: Overwatch) and find the characters really fun. I am able to jump on for a few minutes or hours and continue to be enthused. However, I do think the characters are running out of ""steam"" in terms of uniqueness and the modes haven't changed in a long time (besides a mod here and there). Would mind some random PvE action or larger than 5 team fight."
1499,Might be my first review?! Do not remember but this game is amazing for a free game! If you like Overwatch but want more Paladins is the right game. Crossplay is always a plus also! 9/10 because you sometimes get teammates that are garbage people other then that its great!
1500,yes VERY GOOD
1501,very ok
1502, Engineer gaming.
1503,its good and fun and
1504,"Game is dead. No bug fixes, no game balance, just a skins simulator. Last time i played around 2 years ago, and when you entered the game, main menu like 150% scale. It's annoying and still not fixed, but ok it's only 1 time thing. I guess no need to talk about every bug, cause i'm afraid the steam review doesn't have enough space. Every new patch gives more bugs and after october 4, 2022, this game will lose almost all players. Time is ticking, do someting mojo"
1505,"i love vatu so much, he is the only reason why i still play that shit every fucking time"
1506,Definitely a fun game to play
1507,I love this game. I just started to enjoy Evie. Too bad the server is alway ughhhhh. :(
1508,"I don't know what to say,I play it only because of a friend time to time.
It's just a competitive arena hero-shooter where you need to unlock the most OP and abused Paladin to play with it 89% of the times. (I am exaggerating,it's [b]totally[/b] a joke)

What I can say is that it will remind you of Overwatch but runs a lot better on not good PCs.
Have fun ([spoiler]if you can[/spoiler])."

"
1522,"Ever since the first free-to-play game came out on steam i have struggled to find a better one. 
From just jumping in and having fun, to earning champions and detailing your loud outs. The art, the maps, the community are all good, or better. Matches are fun, fast, and connection is rarely an issue. Competitive game play makes it fun even after many years of playing. I am sure there is more I forgot to mention but there's no downside. 
It's worth it to try, and even get decent at playing."
1523,This game is the reason I have no friends.
1524,"the game is good, the devs realy knew what they where doing with the female champions"
1525,"Nevermind.

Community is a bunch of toxic kids full of zists."
1526,I play it cuz I got band in CSGO
1527,"GOOD GAME
"
1528,"good
"
1529,"Fun Game. Casual play is quite competitive though. As a new-ish player, i'm against players way above my skill level. That's a bit unfair for players who are new to paladins and cannot play in a fair ranked environment. I enjoy playing alone against A.I where i can practice champions. I Love the variety of cosmetics  available so every player always seems to be using a different variance of skin to make the game feel less consistent and repetitive but they're so expensive. Right now, it would cost me more than £70 to claim all 20 cosmetics from battle pass 2020, that's crazy money only for 20 skins and it's still RNG so if you wanted one specific character from the 2020 bundle, you can either gamble and hope you get it for 400 crystals per open or pay double the amount (800 crystals) to get it straight away. One fun way to 'earn' skins could to add very challenging quotas to achieve for every character, not something that takes a few hours to complete like the current trials in the game. One example could be like how you earn a golden variant cosmetic option once your champion gets level 50 (even though you still have to pay a lot to actually unlock the skin).

Phew, I play now :)

gn <3"
1530,"i been playing this game on and off since beta.

solo queuing is a nightmare, this game is so buggy. but they keep adding new champions.

if you play with friends and get good queues, its better than overwatch.

fuck cardio viktor and lex in general tho."
1531,realm royale but worse
1532,"Damn, it sucks cause this game has potential but the bug problems and not even able to play the game cause of a corruption files that I cant even get rid of no matter what I do nor how hard I tried, at this point, the game is unplayable. Power to the people that are playing this game or even able too."
1533,"Just play the game with friends,randoms will draw you away from the game.You're either on a team with fair players or on a team with people expecting you to carry.Don't get me wrong the game is pretty fun,but after the pain I endured from carrying so much weight from other players doing absolutely nothing,you'd think ""shit,did I even clock out of work today?"".I can't express it enough when I say the game is best with friends."
1534,Game is dogshit. I'm not writing multiple paragraphs explaining why a dogshit game is dogshit.

cant't leave a game to the lobby to change settings to controller
changed settings from controller to keyboard after a few games on its own
absolute dogshit way of putting it so you can't change during game what other game does this"
1541,Love the card loadout system that allows you to customize your gameplay style and the many different characters they have. Wish they had more resources to fix the bugs in the game.

1544,pretty good
1545,"fun arcade game, nice to play it once in a while. 
"
1546,"I like this game and yes it is sometimes glitchy but It doesn't really affect the gameplay too much, since it's free you should go try it out because yes

It's a relatively fun game to play sometimes even satisfying, learning everything here is extremely simple you usually don't even need a tutorial to understand the skills and loadouts."
1547,"This is pretty sad. I dowloaded it and after trying to launch the Easy Anti Cheat just crashes and the game stops running. Apparently my ghraphics card is too new and i had to change a .json file so the game launches as a 32bit application. Only problem was is that the game textures wont load. i mean seriously? i was so excited to try the game, i have never been disapointed so quickly."
1548,"meh,game is trash and controller support is pre aimbot"
1549,better than overwatch
1550,good
1551,I wouldn't play this game.
1552,game is buggy
1553,"It's so much better than overwatch don't even at me
"
1554,"If you ever played Overwatch, this is that, but better. Not only did it get announced first, it's just better. The champions seem more balanced, there's more customizability with your loadout, and the makers/dev team/whoever seem like they actually care and listen"

"
1556,Great game terrible customer support. Theyll ban you for seemingly no reason and when you try to contact them to get help or info they either turn you away or say we're offline right now.

1563,fukc iu
1564,after the new update i cant play the game anymore on linux
1565,"Pretty addicting game. Once you play few matches or even one match, you'll keep wanting to play another. Originally came for the RWBY Crossover and never played the game before. Now I'm always playing it after seeing my favorite show in it. Gives me LoL and OW vibes which makes me want to play this a lot more."
1566,i have removed it from my account and redowdloaded it multiple times and it just doesn't work. 5 seconds after i launch it it just shuts down
1567,kinda epic its kinda like uh that one uh Team based multplayer game

1575,could use a bit more work but it's an awesome game with tons of characters to chose from
1576,ww
1577,"An absolute masterpiece, Hi-Rez has delivered yet another hit. There is nothing more thrilling than logging into Paladins with your boys for an entire night of hardcore Paladins gaming. The queue times are non-existent due to the abudance of players playing this marvel of a game, no match is like the other due to the huge variation of wacky and quirky characters!

Truly one of the games ever made, we are blessed to live in a timeline where we can get nuked by Betty La Bomba"
1578,"fantastic! love this game its very well made and its not so massively hd that you need an expensive pc. runs really smoothly on a lower end gaming laptop! highly recommend this game :) 
"
1579,Servers lag so bad not worth playing.

1583,i love this game i love kissing boys also
1584,its good you should try this
1585,fun game
1586,overwatch is and always will be better
1587,Everyone is OP which somehow makes it balanced
1588,better overwatch. never played overwatch. don't like overwatch. don't like this.
1589,"Muito bom jogo estilo Ovewatch....eu prefiro ele do q o proprio overwatch,  variadade enorme de champions pra escolher!"
1590,"Paladins is a solid ""hero-shooter"" game. Yes you can have fun playing this.

It has a fast pace which turns its experience pretty exciting. Even thought it has a low map diversity, when it comes to Champions it has a decent roster and the graphics are pretty okay.

Each character has its own play style, strengths, and weaknesses, and they can be customized with loadouts (cards that provide a wide variety of effects).

Game Community used to be friendly back in the old days and during the long Beta phase, at the moment it's pretty toxic just like most of today's games. But just disable Voice Chat and avoid it. You can also play with your friends since the game has Crossplay (something that took longer for OW to get).

"
1591,"Very fun, alot more balanced than overwatch"
1592,the ungodly things i would do to Io
1593,Don't play this game i beg of you.
1594,i just love it
1595,better than overwatch 1 tbh

1598,dont
1599,so hh what a fun game
1600,Just nice
1601,q
1602,Free Overwatch
1603,This game takes up all of my time still. I just downloaded the PC version for that extra crisp and it runs smooth without super expensive equipment. I recommend this game to everyone! The characters and diversity is amazing. I also bought the character pass to have every character that ever comes out in the game. It's worth every penny since the game is free.
1604,overwatch 3
1605,i can't play game @@
1606,it's a fun game
1607,a
1608,"Very gud game. I play when i want.
very gud gaming play.
recommend 99% time"
1609,really fun
1610,boobs and big butt
1611,...
1612,Very good game with a lot of unique characters and a lot of ways on how to play the game itself. Wonderful!
1613,I absolutely hate this game but I can't seem to stop playing it.
1614,Fun gameplay. Can be an overly toxic community (even in unranked). Player beware.
1615,i only have 14 hours on this because i couldn't buy overwatch
1616,"help us grow the paladins community and join us
"
1617,"Thought this was something of a hidden gem, excellent game.

Basically unplayable with the cheating, writing this review after coming up against a 5 stack, all Chinese characters, all cheating.

It's fairly obvious in game but if you want confirmation the programs they are using also cause your client to black screen rather than going to the end game screen, I assume this is to avoid them getting reported.

EDIT: After another ~100 hours I have not seen a single cheating player, so they might have fixed it!"
1618,Good stuff
1619,This game is the worst multiplayer game I Have ever played avoid at all costs you get killed before you can even think
1620,Actually good lol
1621,Too tryhard for my liking
1622,bad game
1623,fun
1624,Just don't
1625,No refunds for accidental digital skin purchases which they make sneakily easy to accidentally purchase when a skin booster is active.
1626,Rei needs to be nerfed
1627,"way better than overwatch but this game is going to shit lol these constant crossovers are ridiculous, these characters they're releasing look and feel terrible, the skins are terrible and most players have no idea how to play the game"
1628,gg
1629,aint no way people play this competitively
1630,"I hate this game

(proceeds to play it again)"
1631,"It'll make you want to punch a wall and die, but in a (somewhat) good way."
1632,Its like overwatch but.. its overwatch on steam and free.. its overwatch 2 on steam
1633,"Fun game for sure. Even if a game feels unfair, it is over in minutes. Just wait it out.
When you have a clutch win game where you get that final kill. Yum.
There are so many satisfying games that overall carry the games up. 


Even as far as gaining nearly 3k coins per game you play and a new champion costs 30 or 60k coins to buy.
The growth rate is actually not so terrible considering 1 game may only take 6 minutes to complete."
1634,"This is a fantastic First-Person Hero shooter. I would say it's better than Overwatch. It may not be as pretty graphically, but the gameplay is much better imo. The game is constantly being updated to add new cosmetics, balance changes, and new heroes. Not to mention it has Cross-Save, cross-play and it's free to play. You can earn new heroes by playing pretty easily. The game also has full controller support. I have wrist pain, and that feature has been a godsend. Controller is much more comfortable than playing on Keyboard & Mouse for my wrists. The only negative thing I have to say is that sometimes the menus can be a little glitchy on controller, and after a big update, the game launches in a messed up resolution, both of these have easy workarounds."
1635,its ok
1636,vedy gud vedu gud
1637,"needs more modes / variety, years of the same game."
1638,I jumped on someones head and broke their neck with terminus 10/10 would play again

1648,"yes
"
1649,very fun
1650,"Really fun game when Overwatch makes you wanna pull your hair out. I wish your items were on one big account like Fortnite, because most of my time playing this was on my Playstation 4, so I'm starting fresh on a new account without any of my skins.
At least on PC I haven't crashed like you do on the PS4!  lol"
1651,good game
1652,"i've been playing for a couple years now and i usually find myself coming back to this game. the ability to build loadouts that cater to the player's play style is one of the things i really think overwatch was missing. i do miss the 'play of the game' clip at the end of each game that paladins had a few years ago, but overall a very entertaining game. go into it with an open mind :)"
1653,"E
"
1654,nice
1655,"Honestly game is terrible, matchmaking is arguably worse."
1656,anime sucks
1657,Fun and pretty chill :D
1658,yes
1659,surprise good
1660,this is like overwatch right?
1661,"Worst game i've seen, balacing is missing just as much as the variety in gamemodes, the map design has gotten more and more barren, and to top it all of, the matchmaking is a joke. almost every match is filled with agony, when your team picks all flanks, and yore left there wondering ""should i just go play other games"". I have about 500 of in match time now, i can assure you, every single hour has been a waste of my time. Once a game with hope, now a dead graveyard with devs who don't know what they're doing."

1673,"Saati's ass, nuff said"
1674,"Uhhhh, click play launches EAC and fills the loading bar, and then it just closes. Good gaem. 10/10"
1675,"this game tries to be the free version of overwatch, and I guess you get what you pay for. Gameplay was poor and very laggy while the visuals were smooth graphics with single colors. would not recommend, just get any other shooter game and have more fun."
1676,yes! women with huge honkas and men with huger honkas. perfect for any gender of any age
1677,get out while you still can get out while you still can get out while you still can get out while you still can
1678,"This is an amazing game, I want to keep playing this but unfortunately, the servers are shit. The game doesn't start and I keep going back to character select screen for 5 games in a row and there's also randoms or us  not selecting champions also due to server issues. No fixes for these kind of bugs which have been present since a long time apparently as I can see those posts on Reddit and apparently it got worse. And SEA server is worse than other servers. I love this game and I might keep playing but yeah, the server issues are the only reason I don't recommend this game."
1679,"Would be great if the devs were to actually fix this fucking game. Instead they add more hideous cosmetics and skins while the servers continue to become a clusterfuck. Can't even play any games without lagging. Devs need to take out their brain, soak it in highly concentrated clorox solution, rinse it with water then put it back in their thick skulls. FIX THE FUCKING SERVERS"
1680,"FIX THE LAG IN SEA SERVER
"
1681,Overwatch but not Overwatch.
1682,"Launched the game for the first time, played the tutorial, jumped to my first match. While waiting for the load screen to finish I got sent back to champion select and got stuck for 5 mins. I have to end the program because nothing is happening. Searched the problem on the internet, sees the problem is from 3 years ago. UNINSTALLED THE GAME."
1683,"Tons of fun, like if DnD was an fps"
1684,YAAASSSSS
1685,"[h1]This is some shameful sh!t[/h1]

I've been a player since beta version. This has been my favorite game for a long time. It had the potential to be one of the best ever. But now, calling it a shadow of it's former self would be a compliment.

SEA server has been unplayable for nearly 2 years now. It got so bad that I took a year of break from the game, hoping they would fix it by then. But now it's worse than ever. I'm on a 10 match streak where the server just crashes and kicks out all the players and end abruptly.

Where are their priorities? They keep pumping out merchandise, skins and whatever. But never even bother to take a look at how insanely bad the servers are? Trying to make money off of this broken mess is unethical and immoral.

Servers are the heart of any online game, and their servers been dead for 2 years now. If the heart is dead what use is putting on make up. I would NOT recommend this to anyone, except for masochists. Shame of you Low-Rez."
1686,this game makes my pp soft. (i have erectile disfunction)
1687,I would rather brush my teeth with manure and swallow it than play this game.
1688,i only play the heros that have big titys <3

1690,better overwatch just dead asf
1691,"Je reviens sur le jeu parce que plus rien à jouer en ce moment, une game, 10 min d'attente dans l'écran de chargement de match, rien, superbe expérience j'ai alt f4, à dans 1 an pour voir si les jeux s'améliorent avec le temps ou pas"

1707,good cuz free
1708,i have alot of fun healing folks with lightning
1709,"This game is really fun especially with friends. The skins are cool and the load out building adds variety that other games dont have. There are some bugs and the matchmaking system is terrible with experienced players getting matched against new players pretty often. All in all, highly recommend if you want a casual shooter to play with your friends."
1710,"I wouldn't say it's good, but it's definitely not bad"
1711,"i just tried it for a lil bit, not that fun tbh"

1716,so much bug omfg
1717,Paladins is just free overwatch
1718,"Played this game for several years.  Developers are braindead af and wont fix bugs that's been in the game since alpha/beta, shoddy patches that fix 1 thing and break 5 other things and make new hero's that completely invalidate older hero's!  Community is braindead af and paint you as the problem when you point out problems with the game!  Your better off biting the bullet and just go play overwatch 2 when it comes out on Oct 4th.  Don't waste your money on this companies pointless skins and whatever else they can regurgitate."

1727,whats with the extreme lag??? cant seem to have fun playing the game without being bothered by ping lag
1728,"This game is fantastic. Although the player base may be a bit small compared to others, it is still a full functioning game. It's very healthy too. This game is for those who can't play overwatch but really want to and also enjoy games like overwatch."
1729,"It may be hard to play a champion the first few times (there are also champions that are just hard to play), but it's fun, the randomness/chaos in each round just makes it so, not some predictable locked role thing per match. They also have some interesting collabs."
1730," it good game

1731,"Fuck Hi-rez, but really good game. Slightly bad balancing; however really fun

I would prefer filters when viewing chests as you have to scroll all the way down, also the items are mixed together i.e. avatars and emotes etc.

1760,"Nice looking World of Warcraft style shooter. It's usually a messy ability spamfest however and you will most likely spend your time pumping ammo into a rainbow of pixels. If you use any kind of tactics you always win as mostly kids play this.

Progressions seems slow / pointless and it's pay to play other classes than the originals  (or grind a year)."

1786,no

1788,the randoms in this game all have severe autism
1789,"I see that Paladins has an update. Rei, the champion that's been getting pushed, is finally playable. I'm still a little annoyed that we got yet another cute-animal-girl, especially in the healer class, but I'm willing to give it a shot.
Looking at her abilities, she's like a better Io. The power creep is even worse than it usually is and I'm internally groaning at the thought of fighting her.
I look at her cosmetics. I listen to her voice lines. Despite supposedly being a scholar of House Aico, her entire personality is bunny girl. This character was the final nail in the coffin of my 1.3k hour playtime."
1790,"You have the opportunity to swipe the entire overwatch fan base, for the love of god fix the jank. literally first time ever opening it and it crashed, took 30 seconds for the heroes to even load, animations are glitched. But it's fun."

Hope to see u in the game ;)"
1796,Why no turn on?
1797,"its tf 2 but the fans are toxic and its hella complex

1798,PLAY FOR THE RULE 34
1799,its sad such a great game going downhill due to devs' ignorance to community feedbacks and every update bringing plethora of new bugs
1800,"At first, I was absolute poop at paladins. then i said to myself, ""get good""
Team comp is actually key to winning. Its tough at first, but it's enjoyable especially when you have friends to play with. Speaking of ""friends"", my one friend is on the lower side of Level 2 autism spectrum and he loves playing paladins. so I play with him so he feels like he actually has friends and they dont beat him up at the school store during lunch. He gets bullied quite a bit, so I play with him to prevent any potential school shootings. He likes Fernando because all he ever wanted was a big strong man to hold him at night...when it rains.
Can you stop by his twitch channel sometime to be nice to him? he's very slow, cant read well and cant talk well, but he sure as hell tries. 
twitch.tv/wolfpack360

thank you Hi-Rez for making a game that is fun to play and a great escape from reality for my friend.
"
1801,wtf
1802,"Paladins is one of my fav games, the devs are very nice, respond very quickly to problems (on the Hi-Rez website) and the game is all around super enjoyable.

My good buddy with autism (Wolfpack360) plays this game almost daily and seems to talk about nothing but paladins!

The game is hard at first, but after you play for a bit and get a bit better the game is super super fun to play, especially if you have a good friend like wolfpack360 to play with!

The character designs are nice, and team composition really matters! You actually have to work like a team in order to succeed, not like overwatch (yuck!) where no one even cooperates.

Paladins will forever be in my tops! Thank you for making such a great game."

probably what your thinking right now buy it now for 6 lonnies"
1827,Overwatch but its secretly just a fan service.

1830,Shoot shoot bang bang!
1831,everything is fun accept tank roles that my grandad plays cus its so boring

1834,"Don't play this game if you want to keep your sanity. Also Uninstall this game to get Women.

Just came back after an additional 17 hours. Still Don't Recommend."
1835,"Gameplay is okay, but the artstyle is terribly horrible.Quite possible the ugliest shooter i ever played."

1845,dogshit game only play it cause friends won't play anything else
1846,"Playing randos in this is even shittier and toxic than league.

1855,"i dont write a lot of reviews, but when i do the game is normally good or ass. this game is ass. when it first came out it was fun, but it is now a dumpster fire that resembles a chinese moba"

1857,Good
1858,"nothing is perfect. This game has its flaws, but it is still very fun and enjoyable."
1859,fref
1860,"Ive played Paladins for 100s of hours, and played this game before Overwatch. This game is great, the maps are well designed, heroes are well balanced and their skills are easy to use, and hi-rez (old fav of mine) has made a really fun MOBA."
1861,Cringe game
1862,interesting and very good game
1863,sadly this game died faster than my grandfather in vietnam but still kind of fun
1864,I luv gaem
1865,"I played this game until my favorite character, ""Grover"" said ""I think I'm growing a new branch"" then proceeded to make an earsplitting cry that sounded like an excited moan. I never will sleep the same way again. I'm going back to among us."

1869,cool game
1870,Its cool.
1871,banana
1872,no
1873,trash game cant even open the game
1874,"First thing, game always bugs out while opening, if you alt tab for other window, the game opens but doesn't load.
Second thing, worst matchmaking I ever seen. Game is not balanced when making teams at all, for example got 2 games in a row, where the enemy team was clearly much better than mine.
Third thing, report system is awful. It doesn't give the option to explain why you are reporting.
Fourth thing, progression system is very slow, the amount of gold earned per game is too low for the cost of champions.

I can't recommend this game, mainly because of the matchmaking. It has more options than Overwatch and it has updates, but losing games without having the chance to win over and over again, it is not playable."
1875,nice
1876,This is the best game ever. Can be played casual or strategic you choose!
1877,a cheap copy of overwatch but filled with glitches
1878,epic poggers
1879,Very good
1880,god tier
1881,No comments for this game but rlly recommended
1882,"Please for the love of all that is holy fix the crashing! It's horrible when you're at the end of a match and so close to winning, then you crash and don't get any of xp that entire match. Don't even mention that when you use an xp booster during a match and you crash in the beginning, you don't get it back. I won't be recommending this until the crashing gets fixed. Another thing is people going afk and when the bots take over, the bot just freakin' stands there the entire match being afk. Imagine having a bot system to take over someone who is afk but then the bots becomes afk. The battle passes aren't fun anymore, there's not a lot in them. All they do now is two reskins for 2 people and that's IT. I remember they used to have more skins for people in battles passes and it was worth the buy. Might as well be throwing your money into the toilet. Only thing that keeps me happy and sane in this game is Caspian and his body."
1883,They(dev) removed my friend's favorite champion Lex
1884,Actually not bad. Pretty fun but kinda pay to win
1885,"They remove my Lex

1890,this game sucks but the women are cool
1891,Pretty good
1892,good game 10/10
1893,"Fantastic hero shooter, not quite the quality of Overwatch in my opinion. That didn't stop me from enjoying every second of it and the different role types. I enjoy that flank has its own specific role, and the way the card system works for building characters along with the purchasing of items for a change up when I need a break from Overwatch. Both games are fantastic in their own ways. I'd recommend Paladins with an 8/10. If you're a fan of Team Fortress 2 or Overwatch, I say give this game a try."

It compares any shooters like you'll get trash team or good team.
The loot skin are little pricey.

1942,"One of the best FPS games I've ever played. The concept, gameplay and the multiplayer is one of a kind.

1966,"This game's beating heart is choice. A deep roster with three main talents each, and a robust loadout system for loads of customization, then in-game item picks is levels upon levels of choices. It feels good to play something with a highly personalized approach and theory craft on maxing out a specific plan. It's a very good system that feels wholly elevated over other team-based shooters. Been here five years and still having a blast."
1967,"Very fun but most supports are bad, the players i mean
not the characters, they are good
also amazing designs"
1968,Its just better overwatch tbh
1969,Off brand overwatch kinda good ngl

1979,"If you wanna have fun then do not play it right now. I can NOT understand how matchmaking gets worse and worse and worse.
I have to play with pretty new players in my team while in the enemy team theres 2-3 pretty experienced players, most likely in a group. And this happens 8 out of 10 games. You just do NOT want to play it but you like the game.
Imagine doing that to your community. To your players that love the game.
What else to say then, superb matchmaking. 20-0 enemies while your team has 5 out of 10 matches a bot, even more than one bot. LIKE HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. 
I wanna spend money in your game for skins but i can not. I am a gacha player so i like wasting money, eh? BUT YOUR GAME IS SO POORLY DESIGNED. How can you make a already bad matchmaking system even worse."
1980,I'm gonna say this in the nicest way possible. Worst shooter ever made. Like I would rather lose my family in a horrific accident than put one more second into this game.
1981,nice
1982,One of my favorite games :)
1983,"if fun for whole family, free to play, is good"
1984,Pretty good.
1985,"This game is really fun especially with friends. The skins are cool and the load out building adds variety that other games dont have. There are some bugs and the matchmaking system is terrible with experienced players getting matched against new players pretty often. The game is also grindy if u want all the champs without paying some money. All in all, highly recommend if you want a casual shooter to play with your friends."
1986,I recommend this game to others because I used to play this on PS4 and it was pretty cool then i decided to download it on PC and it is really fun i recommend y'all playing this.
1987,"I started playing the game when it came out, and boy it was amazing. Then I stopped playing when I reached something around level 300, and returned about 2 years later - didn't recognise the game. Couldn't really play it anymore, so I uninstalled it again. Went like this for ages, but every time I do play it and understand all the changes, I like it a lot. Not to the extent, that I'd stick with the game permanentely, but I enjoy playing it.

6/10 would recommend"
1988,"They keep adding content, but the game barely works.
It takes up to 10 minutes to launch and crashes before it starts sometimes.

The best part of playing is finding the New Bug every time I launch the game. Last time, none of my abilities worked for 2 minutes during a match, I was stuck in ""on a horse"" mode and could only run around."
1989,game good at times but the devs just kinda add shit and see what happens then after the season ends they do nerfs and buffs especially for new champions
1990,It's a trashy buggy game and it always will be. I hit gm in ranked and it isn't worth the time or effort. Find a different game to play.

2017,"So, they advertise this RWBY crossover, and it seemed awesome, so I decided to try it.  After looking around the client for 20m I realized they did not in fact put those characters in the game.  They added RWBY skins. Shitty bait advertising, but whatever, may as well try the game.

First, the game wont launch as it failed to install the redistributable correctly.  Repair doesn't work.  Had to google the fix.

Finally get it. So I play a game.  It seems really suspiciously easy.  Then I realized the entire game was bots.  Nothing to terll me that, no option to queue for a game with real people.  What a shitty new player experience. Absolutely no respect for anyone who is not playing a FPS for the first time. No indication whatsoever when or how to play against real players, but a google search says I get to actually play the game at level 5. Yikes.

Then I decide I want to try and unlock a new hero.  I see a quest to get a free reward by watching an ad.  Seems mega tacky for  a decently big studio, but ok.  Turn on ad and tab out.  When I tab back into the game it gets stuck on the accept reward screen. SMH.  Havent even played a real match and I already hate the game.  Shame. FWIW IO seemed really fun.


Edit: played a couple more matches against real players.  The in game scoreboard is absolutely awful compared to OW.  You also cant remap keyboard controls??? Like what?  Still not sure if the game has a melee button, since I couldnt find it in the nonexistant keyboard layout settings.  Gameplay is decent, everything else seems to suck super hard.  Also, the game is basically not free to play.  Like smite, you're getting a shitty user experience if you dont buy the all heroes bundle.  Still better than LoL MTX I guess."
2018,good game :)
2019,"wont start, tried everything. kill me"
2020,I only played this to get the Amelia Watson voice pack.
2021,"I'd say play this if you somehow can't afford Overwatch but honestly it's not even worth it then, just go play TF2."
2022,"Played the game for the first time. First game was ok (although we lost), second game the whole team was consistently slaughtered by the enemy which seemed to be twice as strong. Which I would not leave a review for, but the thing is in the middle of the game I was suddenly back in the main menu. No notice on the screen, no information, no notification - the game simply vanished as if it never happened. Not confident in playing like this so this short episode will probably be the first and last time I played."

2032,"I don't play the game a lot but it is enjoyable, even for casual gamers. Only thing I dislike is how hard it is to unlock new characters without spending real money, aside from that it's great for a free to play game."

its p fun, my furia goes crazy"
2054,"This game is trash after the update, I keep getting this ""Connection Problem"" when i already directly connect to my Wi-fii. FIX IT please. I waste so much money is this game because it used to be good but now its unplayable to the point of frustration."
2055,yes
2056,"game is like overwatch but funny
"
2057,"It's just better Overwatch simply put. Everything in this game does something better than Overwatch and is much more enjoyable. You can do a lot more no matter your role you choose to play, as well as upgrades that you can choose to skill branch into if you're doing well in a match to reward you.
Not to mention, the amount of customization with crazy cross-over events like the new RWBY one take an already existing character and reskin them to match the characters from the show. It's so well done and this game needs more attention for it's amazing work.
It's enjoyable, quick games are swift and every champion feels unique to a degree.
I'm genuinely surprised at how much I enjoyed this game as I thought it would just be alright, but it's very fun. A welcome game to my collection that I hope to enjoy for a long time~"

2108,its pure dumb fun
2109,rwby sucks
2110,I love love love this game. I ended up buying the game to unlock all the characters otherwise it's a grind to unlock characters. If you are not careful if you want to get the skins etc you will need to pay and this can add up. I am happy to say I do not feel compelled to purchase any skins and am happy with unlocking them as I progress in the game. I like that it's a multi port game and if the system runs it you can play with others on different systems or PC. I first played this on my switch and for a free game it's definitely worth a try if you like FPS's then this might be what you are looking for. I will also say if you like it buy the unlock to get all the characters so you don't have to grind for them you can play as whoever you want ad when they add more you get them as well so for me it was worth the cost.
2111,meh

2116,"Was my first ever multiplayer game thanks to it being F2P, was great and still is a fun and enjoyable game IF youre playing with friends.... 
Queing solo means youre being pushed into landslide matches with one sided victory almost all the time,having balanced matches is a rarity due to the poor matchmaking as far as i understand.
been declining in gameplay quality since last few months but is still a solid go to for me. 
Hope this was helpful. :)"

2118,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing"

2123,"Game is super fun, you've got so many choices of how to play, be it a character or loadouts for said characters, and even in game items you can buy per game. Its also cross-platform so you can play with your plebeian console friends! (Joke aside, its super easy to find your friends and play with them.) Its a solid game and I would recommend it to anyone who likes hero games like Overwatch. Plus like Smite this game has crossovers with shows and movies! At the time of writing this review theres currently a crossover with RWBY!"
2124,"The game isn’t bad.

It’s an odd game that is heavily inspired by other class based shooters especially Overwatch, but that doesn’t mean it’s not fun. The champions all unique playstyles with abilities and weapons that are fun to use. Additionally, you can edit these with cards to help you excel in a certain playstyles. I found the card system to be a pretty neat system.

However, the game is more buggy than some of the more popular alternatives. There still active updates to this game, but there still a lot of bugs at the end. 

Paladins is a game I suggest you should at least try once. It’s a fine game that can be fun at some times."

2130,"In comparison to other similar games, such as Overwatch, I love how you in Paladins can customize the various champions by choosing different loadouts, talents and items. Amazing game!"

Best free game I've ever played I get on it every day and has great potential :) please get on this game"

2191,"It is pretty fun. Sure, very similar to Overwatch, but it has some interesting differences - mainly deck building and moba-style upgrades buying that make it possible to customize your favourite characters to fit your playstyle.

Some people call it poor man's Overwatch, but let me tell you - I have both games, played both for some time, and I actually prefer Paladins. Idk why exactly, but when I want to just chill, I don't play Overwatch - I play Paladins."
2192,good gem
2193,"Very good game, especially if you enjoy overwatch!"
2194,could've been better if they didn't make the game send you to people that play this 24/7 and if they didnt change the game's mechanics in a worst way possible
2195,If you like losing braincells with randoms (only play with friends)
2196,"i want a refund 
"
2197,SOOOOOOOO GOOD I LOVE THIS GAME
2198,havent played in years but its fun
2199,"This game is as equally horrible and unbalanced as it was 4 years ago, it feels like I never left because it still has the same bugs and problemas it had, and it's even worse. Every update makes the game lose its identity even more and base it around other successful games.

Content now is bare and cheap, the animations aren't as good as they were and the game even has ads now, it's obvious why they got it, barely anyone plays the game now.

Also, why do the healers deal so much damage??? The healers are supposed to be a support class, the main goal would be to make them as supportive as possible, not deal tons of damage.

It has 4k players in-game in a daily basis, but seeing how it's going, it's clear that it'll slowly drop to less than a 100 at the end of the year.

Dead game with horrible dev support"
2200,A great co op game but can be made really better
2201,i dont have very many hours but one recomendation is if they added more nudity
2202,Better balanced than Overwatch with 100% less employee harassment
2203,I like this game because its fun and I wished more people played this and stop overlooking this game as an over watch ripoff. This  game is much more than that and I wish that people could just see that. Paladins is a very small community but with every update is growing larger and larger. I'm looking forward to how this game and its community develops overtime.

2219,"I like how Paladins takes the normal hero shooter pvp environment and allows for customization through the card system.  For someone that enjoys build and theory crafting, I really like taking the time to sit and sort through cards to come up with interesting loadouts.  The card system allows for change up of gameplay and keeps it from stagnating.  You can keep playing the heroes that you grow to enjoy in multiple different ways."
2220,"This is a pretty fun game! This game is semi-fun by yourself, but with other people playing in your party is super fun. This game currently has quests that even give you gems to get cool chest or skins with! Now granted, all the shiny cosmetics will eat up my wallet (optional to buy cosmetics u can also get some for free), but nevertheless I will only semi-regret it later when I am showing it off to my fellow players!"

2225,"Edit: Got in touch with an incredibly helpful support member and the mistake has been rectified , with founders status being restored and again have access to my original account. This doesn't change my opinion, as my time with support was still very stressful and shouldn't have had to wait for this long to have this restored.  

I backed and supported Paladins during the release in September 2016, purchased the founders pack and only played for a small amount since then, upon a few year break from the game and extensive emails between support and myself, I no longer have access to the Founders status on my account.  I have only ever had the one Steam account, and have basically been told to sign into the right account to access my Founders. Yet, this is the account with the transaction history (this is before the requirement to use a Hi Rez account) and the only account I've ever played Paladins from. Not happy and regret supporting in the first place"

2232,Fun game but becomes boring when they keep nerfing your mains.
2233,"like it ALOT

2234,terrible
2235,"I absolutely hate this game, not due to gameplay or anything of the sort, but running it. Running it has been an absolute nightmare, and thats the thing. IT DOESN'T RUN. 

I'VE TRIED PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING. RESETTING MY VIRTUAL MEMORY. UNINSTALLING AND REINSTALLING IT FROM BOTH STEAM AND THE EPIC GAMES STORE HELL I'VE EVEN DID IT TO STEAM AND THE EPIC GAMES STORE IT SELVES. I'VE TRIED UPDATING MY DRIVERS ROM BOTH MY DEVICE MANAGER AND SOME DRIVER UPDATER APPS. AND. YET. IT. STILL. GIVES. ME. THE. MESSAGE ""This application can't run correctly. Click OK to close the program""

I've played paladins on the pc years ago with NO problems but when I try to do it NOW there's a problem. I fully give up on playing this game or even trying to install this game"
2236,Better than overwatch
2237,"Hi rez doesnt give a fuuuug about balance or bugs. Just churning out new champs that will further break the game.

Kinda fun aside from the useless teammates and nonsense design."
2238,only played this game once.. pretty good
2239,GOOD GAME
2240,"The poor man's overwatch, that is somehow better than overwatch."
2241,good
2242,This game cured my depression.
2243,Its kinda good lol overwatch is better tho lol :D
2244,"Many bugs unfixed, particularly the controller bug where every single ranked game, and occasionally a random normal game will not receive controller input except for menu settings, where you can find the input is set to keyboard, switching to controller gives error ""cannot change input at this time"" LOL

Was a cool free to play game until i realized the devs of this game just don't bother addressing the issues reported by players! oh well, i'm gonna try overwatch :P"
2245,GOOD
2246,poopy
2247,very good indeed
2248,amazing. so fun. so many options for characters. never gets old.

2256,"Why the hell do i have this game , get out."
2257,"To call this an Overwatch clone is sorta true, but at the same time it has a lot of things that Overwatch doesn't.
The cards and talents system adds a bit of spice to the game that Overwatch doesn't have, as there's more than one way to play a champion. It doesn't feel like the same game every time, whereas the aforementioned one gets a bit repetitive.

As a standalone game too, it's pretty solid as well. Frequent content, lots of action (there's very little downtime in fights), rotating game modes, a plethora of champions with unique and fun-to-play kits. No two champions feel alike.

Overall, a pretty great game, doesn't get as much attention as it deserves."

2272,"This is one of the games I was excited for when it first launched for Beta, and I was not disappointed. Paladins is one of the best Free to Play games out there on Steam. Many characters to play with, along with constant updates you can never get bored. People like to say this is a clone of Overwatch but there are noticable differences. But ever since they have added the game to steam, Paladins has gone downhill. The only problem I have is the account I played on is still being recovered by their sloppy help team, but what else to expect. So until they respond to my email I have to play on a alt account. I have had so much fun and would even be more enjoyable if I can get my account back. 7/10🔥"
2273,low rezolution game
2274,good

2279,cheesesticks
2280,eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
2281,"Great game! Even though its free to play its very engaging, new champions come out all the time and you really don't have to put any money into the game to eventually unlock all the champions!"
2282,Great game in my opinion a free alternative to OverWatch but in my opinion the balancing is better.
2283,is good
2284,Fernando is a big buff man and is hot
2285,":D
"
2286,sure
2287,Awesome
2288,"Actually really fun, try Koga and blitz the backline"
2289,I love this game! I was introduced to it on the Switch when looking for an online shooter. Then I snatched it up on PC. Now it works on Steam deck at max settings using Proton experimental. I have played Overwatch and I prefer this game! Some of the negatives. I feel like sometimes I can't stay alive for a minute. 1 shot and I'm dead where as the enemies are bullet sponges. Other matches seem fine.
2290,great that the game added a new champion and still cant fix the biggest bugs!
2291,"this game is shit.
characters are not being balanced. for example you have skye who can kill you and you wont even know when and how.
you have corvus who seams to have every abillity you can imagine. and there are MANY more of them. just play and you will kill everyone in your room from rage.
stop making skins and fix your fcking game. make better optimalization. sometimes the voice of the commentator merges and you heare 3 and 2 at the same time or she can start counting after the walls go down and the matches start. 
sometimes you end up on playes that give every posible comms in the game in pregame, if you know what i mean, and i want to mute them because its annoing. i can do that but i'll mute: the commentator, i wont hear when someone is using ult and i just want to play this game.
last game i played raum and i couldnt hear shoots from his gun and sounds of his ults. why?
sometimes when i alt+tab the game crashes and i have to restart it. why?
i realy do not recomand this game, not until they fix it. 
devs if you are reading comments, and i dont think you do but if you do pleas fix your bad, unfinished, ass game."

2300,"ive been playing since 2017 on xbox and i recently got it on my pc. i honestly love this game so much. it makes me feel so nostalgic. but heres my review:

good character designs, fun gameplay, hard to get bored, tons of updates. it basically checks off all the boxes for a good game! i 100% recommend playing it and its even better with friends!"
2301,great game when playing with friend and without
2302,we want blacklight retribution back
2303,"would not recommend to people who want to have fun playing games 
would recommend to people who don't mind endless bugs, unbalanced characters and ruining their mental health"
2304,"Fun game that regularly gets content updates. I love the idea of putting MOBA aspects into an FPS game, it blends together very well!"
2305,I like it picasso
2306,Game free
2307,better than overwatch
2308,paladins>>>>OW
2309,"Very fun so far.
My only changes would be:
The client UI looks ugly & would like more to spent earned coins on."
2310,very much fun
2311,fun
2312,What if overwatch actually got regular updats? novel concept imo.
2313,yeah i love the game.
2314,"Can't connect properly, takes dozens of tries. Linking accounts is broken and support doesn't respond. And now when I try to connect it asks me to create a player name again. I only got interested because of the Koga Skin from Prime gaming but the skin didn't even unlock for me."
2315,3
2316,"Was a boring game, always was a boring game."
2317,"Very addictive, easy to pick up and nearly impossible to put down with new content and Champions continuously being added to the game. Lots of game play customization options. Winning requires you to understand the mechanics of the game as well as the mechanics of the other Champions on both teams. Very fun with friends."
2318,idk if it's still fun now
2319,;))
2320,d
2321,Have Fun Game Like A Overwacth
2322,nice
2323,....................
2324,Love the game but wish they would fix bugs a little faster.
2325,"Its a pvp game.. balance this balance that i can talk about it in full fcking sentences and maybe it is not balanced in some ways maybe it is in others.. but its about the player not the character, if you like it you like it if you don't you don't Have a fun game playing a mini version of overwatch.. some ways better than it some ways worse.. its less of teamwork and more solo version of overwatch where the stronger player has a bigger impact but a teams what wins the games."
2326,FUNKe
2327,good
2328,"broken game, Half of the mechanics don't work. They care more about making new characters than fixing broken / useless one."
2329,"Overwatch's knockoff, this game is really fun to play plus the regular updates makes it enjoyable, although the asia region is dead, the grind is what makes the game unique, please buff Skye 🥵"
2330,should be bugladins
2331,blblblblblb
2332,Overwatch if it was actually fun. Please fix the bugs and add polish though
2333,ah good memories
2334,good game

2336,it's good i guess.
2337,ratio
2338,i love this game its so fresh and uniqe
2339,"very fun all around a great game, so many charicters, you will like someone!"
2340,Someone uses a bow & arrow.
2341,teammates are the comedy relief of this game
2342,Fun
2343,I love this game and I highly recommend it. Paladins is an awesome game and it's totally worth it because it's free to play. I love Hi-Rez Studios because their games are great and super fun. And free. I recommend. Good game.
2344,Good
2345,Too many bugs and they took out the option to buy all the champions at once
2346,So much bouncy boobs.
2347,"Relatively balanced heroes and maps. Plenty of every role so you will find your niche character if that's how you operate.  Healers and tanks can be more fun to play than the dps and flankers but the dps and flankers will reward someone who has good aim. This game has outdone overwatch and I highly encourage anyone thinking about throwing away 40-60$ to just download paladins instead.
So far the only thing I dislike is how long it takes to earn champions. It took me 8 hours to unlock one hero while actively doing my quests for bonus gold (ingame currency)"
2348,overwatch but better
2349,Very Gud Game
2350,sh1t game with dozens of cheater and sh1t teammate with sh1t servers that makes the game unplayable. Sh1t/10
2351,yoooooooooo
2352,"The game is good but the anti cheat ruins everythings, i'll play this game when this stupid anti cheat will be canceled."
2353,been playing for a few years.. removed this game due to game freezing all the time. cannot see the game play many times.
2354,goofy ahh
2355,"i gotta say,i am addicted to this game.i mean,i've gotten fat since i started playing this game"
2356,bad
2357,Nice.
2358,"It's good,"
2359,"Ranked is an absolute shit show. People dodging, taking 3-4 minutes+ to pick/ban, afking, etc. The people who continuously do this need to be permanently banned from the game."

2361,segsss
2362,"For a free to play game, It can get pretty fun, especially if you play with a few friends."
2363,fun game.
2364,always a great game to come back to
2365,its gud :3
2366,"game ok
"
2367,good to play with friends
2368,"For an online FPS, this would be considered pretty mid. But for those who aren't big fans of them (like me), this is GREAT to get into them with some friends without it being as anywhere near as stress-inducing. It won't cost them anything to join, so should be easy to get them to at least try it with you.
ik this says only 15hrs of play at time of review, but that doesn't count the other 25hrs I first played on my Switch"
2369,it bad game but bomb king is hot
2370,Pip is sexy respectfully
2371,Good
2372,It's a good game and fun to play when you know the other people in your part. I enjoy this game a lot and you learn many things.

2377,"Pros:
-It's fun to play (most of the time)
-If you suck at aiming you still have abilities
-Free to play
-Cute skins 

Cons:
-Lots of bugs and the devs never fix them (its a miracle if they do)
-Sometimes you don't get the rewards from trials
-Matchmaking sucks peepee"
2378,childhood
2379,better verison of overwatch cause they actually care.
2380,g a m e : )
2381,"Meh, just buy overwatch"
2382,"Toxic teammates that are 10-20 lv. Opponents are always higher level than you and your team. There is nothing wrong with the game but there is something wrong with the players. After 10 games i got 140.lv opponents when i was only lv. 14. I got 1 hacker as my teammate, so we won. I have got many hackers as a opponent. One that spawn killed my team from the other side of the map. I can't report them, so they will keep hacking in other games. Fix your game."

"
2384,uwu

2389,Shit fucking game.
2390,"big booty elf, 10/10"
2391,Better than Overwatch.
2392,"GREAT GAme! very under rated, I like all the custom loadouts and unique champions!! 8/10 need some polishing here and there put over all great with friends!"
2393,no sex
2394,"Ive played this since 2018 and still one of my favorite games, I stop play for months and when I come back I enjoy fighting against all the new champs"

"
2396,asd
2397,"Haven't played for a while and when I installed the game and play again, my account has been reset including my purchases and when I reported the issue, the support needs a lot of info. In the end they still didn't process my request. Waste of money and time.!"
2398,Bring Back Play of the game and kill cam and im in
2399,"Review from someone that didn't play since 2019

To be honest the game still looks great and stuff but as someone that is a completionist I really hate how half of the profile things are locked behind past event and some achievement (well, one of them) is not unlockable anymore

If you don't care about these things I guess the game still is pretty fun"
2400,i liked the game
2401,no
2402,"game will start but wont stay running, literally shuts off after the anti cheat screen"
2403,"good game
"
2404,"jnrjrthr

"
2405,Yes
2406,"The best part about Paladins is the developers don't water down the game every update like Overwatch. Hi-Rez doesn't even remove content when people complain about it being too sexual for their grade schooler. Play this instead if you have remotely good taste in fps games. I'd recommend a friend or two to queue with, though."
2407,good
2408,Best game for 5v5
2409,its ok
2410,play it
2411,"
I downloaded this game today and post to say that I did not expect it to be so well optimized.

Paladins is a game with a multitude of champions from which you can choose your favorite and learn it as best you can.
There are a lot of game modes and I really like to play them all.

So I personally recommend it especially because you don't get bored in it if you play alone"
2412,Fun game. Underrated
2413,"More fun than Overwatch, that's for sure"
2414,"ebic video game no buigs at all
"
2415,This is a fun game for anyone who likes fps shooters with characters with skills. Paladins is an easy game to pick and and play casually or competitive for anyone.
2416,    bbb
2417,yes B)
2418,"pretty cool, interesting etc. Like it :)"
2419,"It's free Overwatch!  It's fun as hell, works well, plays well, and is a lot of fun.  Worth a try."
2420,THIS GAME IS GOOD !!!!
2421,"dont waste your time. This game might be cool for the first few games, or days playing but you will soon realize what makes this game such a joke. From the devs only caring about money and the lack of interest in making the game good. Let me start off with the maps. the same maps you are going to see have been the same maps since 2019. the maps suck are old and the design of them are horrendous. you will come to realize the invisible walls that with randomly stop you from using willo's flitter, drogoz rocket boost and even when trying to throw someone off the map with khan. Another issues is how ""heavy"" the walls are. the walls stop your movement. this is not the game for walls to be messing with your movement. the maps (even though need major improvement) arent the biggest issues tho... its the champions, Hirez only cares about adding new champions in the game and skins to try and get people to spend money. Though its not pay to win it doesnt even matter because the champions are still broken. (or atleast some) Skyes damage and invisibility, Lians autoaim, seris (a healer) also being a flank and damage, (Vivian. Viktor, Tyra and Octavia) all being boring cov/valorant inspired characters broken in their own way, and some healers having more damage output than flanks and other damages. all in all alot if not most of the characters in this game are broken and need reworks and some of them needed them 2 years ago. to put it simply this game has a bunch of issues and bugs and is only worth playing if you dont care about winning. the devs dont care about what the community wants and only cares about pumping new characters and skins. their are better games to be wasting your time on than this broken, buggy, dying game."
2422,how to see recent reviews on steam
2423,"better than ow
"
2424,"Fantastic game, fast paced, mostly fair.  If you're looking for a fun game to play and have fun.  Play it"
2425,its ok i guess
2426,amanzing fun
2427,"Does not even starts up. Fresh install, loads for about 10 seconds splash screen and then process disappears from Task Manager"
2428,its gud
2429,Bang! Bang! But I don't wanna stop!..
2430,AMAZING IT LIKE FREE OVERWATCH
2431,good game to play with friends
2432,gg
2433,"Many of the characters in this game are broken but I find that the brokenness of the game is what makes it feel great. Enjoyable fast-paced team hero game play, I would highly recommend it."
2434,better than overwatch
2435,"I'm ashamed that I haven't gotten to play this game earlier.
I've gotten more fun out of this game then I've gotten from Overwatch :)"
2436,ydrtuf
2437,"Very fun game to play, you can have a lot of fun with it and it has constant updates to make it even better."
2438,"its pretty fastpaced and the ranked system is pretty well done
"
2439,Better than Overwatch
2440,"one of the best games of its kind...addicting,challenging and entertaining."
2441,old but still good
2442,loved this game since day one.
2443,"The game is fun, but it's really time-consuming to farm for credits to buy characters."
2444,The characters in this game have pretty big buts
2445,"I really want to like this game. i enjoy the characters, i like playing it when it's actually 5v5 and not 3v5 because both of the people who instalock flank/damage ragequit round 1 before the first point has even been captured. it's fun with friends but to actively need 5 people just to find the game somewhat enjoyable is ridiculous. 

Oh, and the sometimes the enemy team doesn't make any noise. which is fun

I can't recommend this game in good faith to anyone other than a masochist. don't bother downloading it unless you want an aneurysm."
2446,epic
2447,like overwatch but less misery
2448,Not full of bots or developed by the makers of Diablo Immoral.
2449,Awesome game that just needs more support! Other games like this but the gameplay on this is more fluid than the others.
2450,good game
2451,fire
2452,Is good. I play as the free waifus. <3
2453,"good skins, winky face"
2454,"I hate this game. Very fun, fantastic with friends. I used to play this game often Solo.

Bullets are bigger than most games, so solo carry potential imo is much higher. This changes with the more higher level people you fight, but for the most part when I do quick play everyone is pretty casual. 

AOE Spam kinda sucks, still don't know the counterplay to some situations or if there even is counterplay cause you can't swap. If there is a meta, I refuse to learn it.

Grab some friends (not included w/ game ;-;) and go ham honestly. The Skins are great, more diverse than Overwatch actually. Some collabs here and there, and you can have Amelia Watson cheer you on if Vtubers are your thing.

Unfortunately, I am only a simp for the carnage I sew. My friends refer to this as being ""bitc*less"" and personally I don't know how to take that cause it hurts my feelings but what can you do

good game, DLC is worth it if thats what if you're wondering, play it"
2455,"Divertido , casual , nada hardcore , para pasar un buen rato ,  muy bueno"
2456,great with friends
2457,crashes 24/7
2458,shit
2459,i only play this game because of the female skins
2460,"Paladins , its a very nice game . but in the past it was way better"
2461,"I like the part where the bomb king announcer says ""ANNIHILATION!""
Just makes my brain go boom boom pow yknow?"
2462,"As of right now I would not recommend this game, When I first started to play this game me and my friends had tons of fun, close games, ridiculous matches it was fun, but in atleast this past year the game has took a turn for the worse. From its in game ads, to more microtransactions, yes for mostly cosmetics and quicker character unlocks, to releasing characters that are completely broken and nerfing characters that should not be nerfed or not supporting characters at all. The biggest change they have done done that, in my opinion, has ruined the game is the global cauterize, anti-heal. Starting any given match as a support is almost a detriment to your team when you do not even heal them for the full value but 30% LESS value starting off. As well as the followed insane damage from quite a few champions make it ridiculously hard for a support player to make it absurdly hard to heal your teammates. This game has definitely went from a game you could pick up by yourself to a game where you NEED a team of 5 that perfectly strategizes to play in its skilled based matchmaking system, and even then there is no guarantee you won't be put up against the god mode enemies.
TLDR: as of now with its many issues I would not recommend but I hope it gets fixed in the future for me and my friends to have fun with"
2463,"PLS WHATEVER YOU DO DONT PLAY IT
"
2464,"It is a fun game. Pretty sure nobody wants to do this comparison anymore but honestly its better than Overwatch. And Its f2p. You can even save up enough by just playing the game to buy battlepasses, skins, chests, cosmetics etc.

The only downside I could say is that the game was too generous with it before and now its nowhere near. Just like Ive mentioned, as long as you played the game enough to get level your battlepass, you got shit ton of crystals back so you didnt really have to use cash. But I still did for the Army Men Viktor skins etc. the game deserves it. But yeah I just got used to how much crystals I got back from just playing the game It doesnt give as much anymore. But the game itself is still fun so just have a blast."
2465,"Amelia Watson voice pack makes this game good. The rest of the game sucks a lot. The optimization is terrible, and the mechanics are questionable. But the Amelia Watson voice pack makes everything alright."
2466,my id old loss
2467,FUN
2468,"in good conscience i cannot recommend this game to anyone due to the intensely predatory model of play: microtransaction and FOMO predation out the wazoo, almost mobile game ads bad. there's literally an option to watch advertisements in the menu in-game for a laughably minuscule amount of basic currency as a reward. 

the game also frequently has bugs. some are long-known merely annoying bugs - sometimes one of the basic grind currency shops screws up and wipes your currency amount + makes nothing selectable in the store, but it's just a graphical glitch that fixes eventually. you get notifications after every game for the total amount of gold you've acquired since opening the game, which is annoying on its own but also disappointing to realize as a new player. there have also been a few bugs i've run into that require force-closing the application entirely.

it's fun and i'll probably keep playing it but man. come on."
2469,Great game.  Low technical barriers.
2470,"I can say if you want to have fun, and not be absoulutley seething on overwatch, with/without friends, play yhis game. Its a funner, easy, and free to play version of OW."
2471,Groover
2472,OG game ehich I played when I was 11
2473,"pretty good game the card system is nice and is a good way to differentiate from overwatch

Good game doe :)"
2502,fun game
2503,"Let me say one thing, everyone stated that Paladins shouldn't be seen just as the free alternative to Overwatch, it's also really fun to play friends with & nice competitive system, this is a free-to-play-heroic-shooter that allow the player to enjoy thousands of hours of shoots, the design overall is something other and makes it awesome. 
Really Goodjob - 8/10"

2534,wont even launcg
2535,Great online fps game. Runs smoothly with no bugs or glitches and isnt really pay to win
2536,Enjoy while it lasts
2537,"This game is unplayable, not only because of the horrendous bugs but also because of the horrific balance issues, this game is free but will cost you ur sanity. Not like ur missing out on much anyways, once OW 2 comes out, this already small community will finally realize that the devs don't care and the game will die."
2538,"Game will just randomly lag regardless of internet
Constant disconnection problems"
2539,It's fun with friends but alone is not playable
2540,"If you like being trashed for simply existing, this is the game for you"

2542,AUGH monkey like
2543,"if you manage to enter the game, its real fun"
2544,"Damned fun, free, cool characters -- like Overwatch but taken less seriously, which means it's more fun because the people you play with aren't sweaty tryhards."
2545,"Fun team based shooter. Very much an overwatch clone, but also very different. I dig it."
2546,3000 hours on record. real.
2547,How dead you want this game to be? Yes!

2553,wefhoweifjwef
2554,nice
2555,better than overwatch lel
2556,This game seems like a TF2 that was released later and a free Overwatch.
2557,"Game play is amazeing,
after cautrize was removed from the purchesable crads and put in over time,
game became a bit boreing and at times unfair for the healer class hopefully they bring it back in the future and replace it for something else that nobody uses.
Also gets boring after about a month but is fun to come back to.
7.5/10 ""The game that you will keep forgiveing"""
2558,best game ever
2559,gud gam
2560,"fun game to play with friends, and doesnt take long to get the hang of it

2565,fun
2566,"it very fun
"
2567,"If you dont mind the same 3 gamemodes being played over and over, along with 1 comp gamemode I think its pretty good. It has a diverse cast of characters, lots of unique builds and a pretty good selection of characters in specific roles"
2568,.
2569,ieee chupapi
2570,Good game
2571,idk
2572,this is one of the best team games out there.
2573,i tink is better than le Overwatch si si si oui coño
2574,"Honestly it's one of the games I played the most, even since the beta.
The game is really fun to play itself and I like they're giving it more content
but there are 2 main problem with Hi-rez games:

1 -  Their servers
From 10 games 7 there's at least 1 AFK, if there's one, lot of people usually leaves
what makes it frustrating to play

2 - Matchmaking
Ridiculous on normal games and even worst in ranked.
Low level with high levels
Low rank with high rank

Sad to see the state of the game right now.
Uninstalled the game after many years.
"
2575,fun
2576,"Good, this game needs more respect"
2577,"I played this game with my friend. This was his honest review of playing the game. ""Dear creators of paladins, I am really thankful for this games existence. I have been struggling with terminal cancer my whole life and it’s really been impacting my lifestyle. The doctor told me I had 3 weeks to live and that things were looking bad for me. However, once I downloaded paladins, this all changed. After I played my first match in this game, every single cancer cell in my body decided to literally fucking kill itself because of how shitty of a game this was. It looked like a fucking seizure and the gameplay was horrendous. Thanks to this game I am now officially cancer free!"". I agree with this. 8/10 would play again"
2578,funny free overwatch go unbalanced haha
2579,Great game frfr check it out
2580,GOod gaME FUll of NOOBs but VERY fun
2581,"This game makes me lose track of time, one min I'll be just starting the game and then blink and it's been 6 hours. I haven't eaten or showered in days please send help I need he-

10/10 play now"
2582,gg
2583,"Best F2P game that you can play in my opinion. Good balance between characters. Stays exciting for a long time. And if you get bored with a champion or game mode, you just switch."
2584,Makoa.

2587,ligma balls
2588,yes
2589,hjbk
2590,nice
2591,I wish the devs cared
2592,"It's a great game to pick up, and I have very little complaint. It's such a shame that great games like this that are free-to-play, do not receive the recognition it deserves. It's such a priceless gem"
2593,o
2594,Good fun hero type shooter
2595,good game yes

2603,ying is my waifu
2604,fun with friends and fun alone if you're playing ranked matches
2605,...
2606,"A good few times play, I'm just glad this is for free unlike a certain overwatch."
2607,"The fact that you can use different talents and decks already makes it waaaay more fun than Overwatch, especially for casuals.

[u]3 Examples:[/u]
[b]Sniper Grover[/b] 
[b]Full Knockback Bomb King[/b]
[b]Max Spin Zhin[/b]"
2608,Love the game. the devs keep updating the game and it keeps getting better. definitely recomend this game.

2614,Its okay i guess
2615,"This was the first fantasy FPS i picked up, not wanting to pay the price for Overwatch at the time.. Since then i have played a few hours of this, but eventually picked up overwatch and dumped my time into it. There's plenty to be said for that game and it's community but i'm coming back to THIS GAME because i like the developers, i like the heroes and fast paced combat, and... well... i bought the founders pack back in 2017 sooooo. 

Cassie is my girl. this game is like overwatch, only kinda better. 
If your opinion is different, that's ok. it's just wrong :)"
2616,"Honestly a fun TF2-Like game, too many classes"
2617,yes
2618,this is the game my ex got mad at me because she didn't want me to get better 10/10

2627,lol good game
2628,the game crashes a lot but i have a lot of fun playing it.
2629,"the game is unbalanced, the game doesnt rely on how good somebody is but rather how good their champion is. Instead of pumping more characters into this game, work on balancing how the game is played

3 : ... Hot Anime Babes"
2641,only good becz its free
2642,"YES
"
2643,"This game is awful and has been for years yet it somehow gets worse everytime I come back to it. I could write a 5 page paper on all the problems but anyone who cared enough to read it probably already knows this game is a dumpster fire. Either characters have too much mobility or not enough and the mobile characters are impossible to hit unless you're a fucking navy seal or playing some spammy AoE bullshit. Most games are the tanks trying to stand on the point while people spam AoE and the mobile characters carry  the game since they can spend more time in the air than on the ground. Also this game can't be borderless windowed? 

Only play this to laugh at how bad it is."
2644,"Yes, this game is very fun. Balancing can be a bit rough, but it's usually good. 8/10"

2658,"This game is good. It's free and fun. It keeps receiving updates unlike some other games I know.
Has several quests and rewards to keep you busy.
Hi-Rez should add the smite heroes in this game for extra chaos."

2684,"While not perfect, Paladins continues to bring me back with new content, features, updates and an awesome community of dedicated players. 

I find Paladins very fun in its diverse list of champions and playstyles available with the cards system. For someone reading this who has no idea of what I'm talking about, you can basically create a loadout of cards that increase certain stats of yours e.g. reload speed or damage reduction while a certain ability is activated. You have points you can invest in 5 cards from the total of 16. This system is wonderful in customising your playing to fit certain situations, change your role entirely (DPS healers are awesome) or testing out some wacky builds. 

Paladins is frequently updated with balance changes, bug fixes, new skins, map reworks, champions and new gamemodes, most notably a recent addition, Siege: Beyond which aims to experiment with new gameplay elements that won't affect the main gamemodes, but if the community loves it, it may be added!

Speaking of the community, the Paladins fanbase is very active and a good place to experience the game together. There's a lot of art, guides, tutorials, memes, discussions etc. The community is listened to as well and the devs are asking feedback for things every now and then!


While Paladins has a lot of great features, it's not completely polished, like UI bugs, getting stuck on a loading screen and audio bugs, like the audio of your own character disappearing. Sometimes champions are way too powerful or way too weak, but the devs take action on that. 


All in all, wherever this game goes, I'll be here to see it. I still enjoy it after years of playing this on and off and more actively in the last couple years. Give it a try, it's truly a fun experience."

2692,"Came in as an exile from TF2 after its bot death looking for some casual shootin'.
Is this budget Overwatch? Sorta. But also kinda better in a way

+ the gunplay feels more satisfying than OW actually
+ item and cards system adds some playstyle options to the already huge list of champs
+ haven't really encountered cheaters at all, know they exist but at least it seems somewhat under control
+ movement doesn't have the depth of arena shooters or even TF2, but at least feels faster than OW
- shields and stuns, tanks seem to dominate games
- anti-healing makes supports really frustrating to play sometimes (I do like Grohk tho)
- I have 120 hours and haven't unlocked even half of champs. Progression system is really slow if you don't spend real money. Good thing I'm patient.

Disclaimer: I haven't tried ranked and don't intend to. The casual experience is good enough for me. Still miss TF2 but this is enough to scratch the shooter itch for now. Decent game if you don't take it too seriously, and it's free."

2695,Really cool and fun game ruined by one of the most toxic fucking communities ive ever had the displeasure of playing with. Would not recommend this game to anyone tbh. Reports have done nothing or if they do actually ban/suspend people then they sure as hell don't let you know any of it. So sad to see a game that could be so much fun just be absolutely destroyed by it's own players. This isn't even mentioning the plethora of game killing bugs and the amount of cheaters in the game.

2700,"the fucked up thing about this game is that it actually has good gameplay mechanics and shooting. The point and card system adds a lot of needed replayability to the game. The moba elements also work in its favour for gameplay, giving you the ability to counter whatever bullshit the other team might bring. However it is generally very badly balanced (especially when a new champion comes out) and the artstyle in my opinion fucking sucks. Hyberbolic, but it is borderline bearable in my opinion. It only really gets to you when you are getting tired of the game though"

2704,"I play this whenever I'm so bored out of my skull I could stare at a wall for hours - it's like an Overwatch copy, but it feels like an unpolished mobile game from 1998.
Some characters are fun to play - but their abilities are usually that of Overwatch & League of Legends characters, combined with some dumb unique ones, obviously designed by Hi-Rez themselves (because they're bad and lack creativity)

DISCLAIMER: Game makes you braindead and lose all faith in the gaming industry whatsoever, but it's good for a laugh/you wanna walk around and shoot people with weird abilities you'd find nowhere else, kinda."
2705,"Have been playing this game since 2017 on multiple platforms. Although 2017 and 2018 were some great years for this game, a lot has been improved ever since. But the past few months I have been terrorised by regular disconnects mid game. And no, my internet is completely fine got a new ethernet cable and latency is under 15ms. The gameplay is fun, despite the imbalance of certain champions. But the instability of the game that makes me disconnect just doesn't encourage me to play the amount i used to, encourage others to play too or spent money on the game.

I'm going to make this a blog. New update: encountered a new bug. Now if loading into a game gets corrupted(?) you can't use your keyboard, instead it will preform windows shortcuts with every different key. what else is there to recognize? if using an announcer it will change to default, if you want to change to a new loadout it will only show those for a rank 0 champion. Oh and that's not all the disconnects i talked about previously are getting worse. Not long ago i got disconnected 5 times in a single game. Everyone in the community knows the game is dying, and yet they only fix the most worthless bugs. Not sure if i will continue to play anymore, but you'll see my playtime after this review."
2706,"I may have very few hours in this game according to steam compared to the other platforms i may not be so good at this game but i love it. it features cross progressions between the two other platorms with this version of paladins (not going to say the one other major platform this game is featured in that isn't cross progression) it's annoying that they have very few featured modes compared to another game but i have noticed that they added a sort of hardpoint domination version that you may end up with when you pick onslaught instead of just capturing one point you may have to move to capture a teleporting ring. it's really nice that this is first and foremost f2p but unlike many other games despite how it has battle passes (yes it's a game that has season and battle passes that you have to pay for) that have cosmetics that once it's gone you can no longer attempt to earn them but in this game they kind of do it right (to some extent) where you can have a chance to get said cosmetics from loot chests that are paid with in premium currency/crystals  (i'm not a fan of loot boxes but it beats not being able to get certain cosmetics that you missed out on) though you'll have to look at the many pieces of items you can get within certain loot chests because they have different loot chests that features different themes and such or types of rarity of the cosmetics. i'm not entirely a fan of how much crystals cost compared to some cosmetics but from what i remember you can gift crystals in game to another friend and i do like how they sometimes feature new/unusual modes for events like back then they had this one mode where you have to knock a ball into the opposing teams goal though i haven't seen anything that different after i stopped playing. they have added a mode variant related to siege where the payload/cart does take damage but i haven't played that yet so they are at least trying to give us something new to play with and i'm liking how many characters they have given us to choose from and sometimes they let us use the new/old characters  in a sort of trial that cycles every now and then for different set of characters that we haven't bought with in game gold or premium currency or the bundle you can buy in that includes majority of the champions so far (time of this review). or you can buy seasons passes for certain cosmetics and the newer champions that'll come out during the yearly cycle that it states it's for. some of the cosmetics that you can get from the battle pass/event pass i like but they seemed a bit too grindy back then but with less tiers and decent amount of days it's not so bad these days. they do collabs at times thankfully so you can get some out of place stuff that may fit in with the world or maybe not (this game has a weird but satisfying theme with some modern like weapons and fantasy creatures that some might of not thought of exist or barely heard of) overall i think it's a similar but fun game like another popular hero shooter you may have heard of but this one plays differently but this game sometimes feels a bit slower i'd rate 8.5/10 it's something worth coming back to now and then but it's best to not get addicted to it and put a lot of money into. 
Extra notes/edit :They once had third person perspective but it's gone now  i don't know why but it was a good feature back then especially for cosmetics but you can still see you champion from time to time in third person but only with certain actions or at least while your riding your mount and i'm not sure why the one platform doesn't feature cross progression (at least with my account)"

2742,"Introduction

Hi, my in-game name is CzeMarek and I spent about 1500 hours with this game. In every season I played, I managed to obtain the rank of Master. I love the pace and mechanics of the game, however I could not recommend it to anyone.

The Developer's Approach

From the early beginning when Paladins was still in beta, it suffered from a lot of bugs. Hi-Rez studios didn't seem to have a need of fixing the bugs as the first priority. This way, the list of present bugs grew with every update. Some bugs have literally lasted in the game for YEARS and are still there! Let me talk about one as an example. Sha Lin is a damage class champion with a bow, that he uses every second of a match. Since the day I started playing the game (which was in the autumn of 2016), there has been a big problem with the champion - everybody has had huge FPS drops when drawing the bow. Now just imagine, there are dozens of bugs that have, just like this one, been in the game for years and haven't been fixed yet! In the present, Hi-Rez are still focusing on new content instead of bug fixes and with every patch the number of bugs is growing; there are even champions that cannot be played in e-sports because of how much they are bugged.

The Beta

Paladins was in beta for years. Many times, the developers made drastic changes to the mechanics of the game; they even reverted some patches in OB67 (which was probably the best update in the history of Paladins)! Now don't get me wrong, the long beta was perhaps the best thing Hi-Rez ever came with. During the beta, Hi-Rez released a new champion every odd patch and a new map every even. This would be great, if they also put effort into fixing bugs. In may of 2018, they decided to release the game from beta with the patch 1.0, due to lack of finances. This was the worst thing that could have happened - the game was in a bad state, unpolished and full of bugs. Even now, almost a year after the patch 1.0, I don't think the game is in a state, in which it could be released. In my opinion, this move bought Paladins a one-way ticket to oblivion and extinction.

The Matchmaking and Ranking System

The ranking system is basically pointless - it records your personal rating in the team based game, while it doesn't take into account your personal performance! That means it doesn't matter how well you do; if you spend the whole game afk in a spawnroom, you will lose the same amount of points as a person, who unsuccesfully tried to carry your team and ended up with the best numbers in the game. Now you might think that's fine, but it is really not. Wait times for ranked are awful. You have to wait usually about 10 minutes for the match (if you have a decent ELO), then you pick champions for another 3, then someone crashes, then you wait again and when you finally get to play, you get queued with smurfs and people who have much lower ELO than you, so the game lasts for about 7 minutes anyway and it's just not fun. So in the end, you spend way more time waiting for your games to find than actually playing. Also, let's mention the leaderboards. The list of grandmasters, who are supposed to be the top players in the game is just a joke. Everyone who has thousands of hours to play can get there. There is only a few people in GM that have a good W/L ratio, you can go check for yourself. So to sum up, the rewards and ranks are just an index of how much you play and how long you grind.

The Bots and Reconnecting

A bot, character controled by AI, is a definition of evil in this game. In higher ELO matches, when a player crashes or leaves the game due to any other reason, it basically means a lost game - bots are very likely going to spin in the spawnroom or, if they decide to join the fight, just blindly rush and die. Now you technically play a 4v5 game. In other scenarios, the bots get inhuman skills and reflexes and thus you have a 6v5 game. Due to the bugs and bad servers, you are going to have at least one bot in 25% of your games. The bot is even allowed to buy items for you, which is a problem when you have a limit of 4 various items to purchase. Your teammates will probably become afk too, because, seriously, who wants to play a 4v5 game? The afk players will not receive a ban anyway, because Hi-Rez probably ignores all the reports. Of course, a disconnected player can reconnect and continue playing (althought there is a bug that makes you unable to rejoin the match). The problem is that after your game crashes, you have to wait until the anticheat opens (which takes an eternity), then fill out the the crash report or close it and after all that you can start Paladins again. But that's not all! If the game lets you connect back into the match, your bindings reset so you have to open and close the settings and the textures usually become broken too. When leaving the spawnroom after reconnecting, you teleport when passing the exit, which makes the play around the spawn impossible. What's more, your FPS might get crazy and the whole experience you might have gotten from the game is completely ruined. If you or your teammates decide to give up, there is no way to do so, because the option to surrender was taken out of the game for a reason.

The Balance

Every champion has 3 talents that a player can modify the playstyle with. This sounds interesting, but in the end this is just an illusion of choice. Most of the champions' third talent is just weaker than the others or completely useless. Many times, there is only one good talent for the champion and if you pick another, you are basically throwing. The reason for this is that some champions have a bad base kit. Let me take Ying as an example. Ying is a healer that can heal with illusions she places. She has a talent that makes her able to heal for a straight 800HP with a right click. Now with this talent she is considered one of the best healers in the game. And without the talent? You're throwing! Another problem is Hi-Rez itself - it takes insanely long for them to nerf the overpowered talents. For instance a card that gave you wallhack every 3 seconds was nerfed after more than a year!

The Way Information Is Given to the Player

The game doesn't tell you anything about itself. Only thing it teaches you (in tutorial) is how to walk and shoot, which you can read in the setting. It doesn't say a word about the mechanics of the game. it just doesn't tell you anything! If you are a new player, do you know what does a 'Comback mechanic' mean? I doubt it, even the e-sport casters have to explain it 10 times a day. The game does not even explain loadouts or an item shop!! Only way you learn about it is by noticing an UI prompt that says 'PRESS I TO PURCHASE ITEMS'. And there are more: The killstreaks and their relevance, the effect of silence, cripple and CC... You are not even able to figure it out by yourself at the Shooting range, because the bots there are immune! And I could continue for days. Some mechanics aren't explained at the Wiki either; you seriously have to go and ask a content creator in the chat of his stream or comments under his video!

Other Game Modes

There are also other game modes apart from Siege in Paladins. Let's talk about Team Deathmatch. The maps for this mode are often designed so badly, it's painful to play. A lot of them have very bad spawn points and one team has an advantage over the other. The spawn algorithm is so bad, it sometimes doesn't move your spawn point for the whole match (thus you have to travel a long way to the battle or you just might get easily spawn-camped). All this causes that 75% of the map can remain unused. Furthermore, Hi-Rez is still trying to force you to play it by creating stupid TDM missions and other kinds of content.

Summary

There is much more but let me post a final verdict here. I give this game 2/10 and recommend everyone to stay away from it as far as you can."

2778,"Buggy mess.
In co-op pretty enjoyable tho."
2779,"TL;DR - Fun game to invest time in but has many bad players and bugs. Core gameplay loop and varied Champions feel amazing. Skill floor to learn champions is very low, skill ceiling is reached by teamplay (that you rarely get to experience) and positioning skills. Bad players will make it hard to enjoy the game if you want to win. Oh and pretty girl skins.

[b]The Paladins Experience[/b]
Most players are bad, you learn to go Damage / Flank to carry most of your games, going Frontline / Support is worthless since you can't carry, enemy team will be better than your team 65% of the time, and you'll carry against bad enemies for 40-50 hours until matchmaking finally gives you competent players. 

Doesn't mean you cant come across good or competent teammates, it's just rarer. Game is best played in queue with friends / pre-made teammates. Like any other multiplayer game. If you're anti-social, g'luck.

Biggest problem is that the enemy team will eventually grow a brain. Carrying when your team is bad will get harder. They'll learn to target you, the only competent player; they'll learn to run away, since your team won't be able to damage them at all; but worst of all, they'll learn to [b]play together.[/b]

Good luck learning the game outside your main champions, you'll lose a majority of your games since you can't carry without Champion experience. Enjoy the slow learning experience.

Gameplay loop itself is great but casual multiplayer is excruciating, play ranked if you want competitive gameplay. And watch videos / guides before starting, you don't want to start at a low rank with the same casual matchmaking experience.

It's not all bad though, lots of great skins, [b]especially for the female Champions.[/b] Though, you'll spend about 800-1000 USD if you want to get every RnG skin / item in the game. Been playing off and on since beta, game is just fun to play sometimes. It's also a royal pain in the ass."
2780,when paladins 2
2781,"Paladins is a game that used to be great, several years ago. In its current state, all new players should stay away. This game is highly infected with hackers and other toxic players. It is so bad, that EVERY match has AT LEAST one hacker, AFK player, or just toxic player. The ""skill based"" matchmaking is very poor because of the game's low population. It is very common that new lvl 1 players will be pitted against grandmasters with lvls in the hundreds. The devs are also just releasing champs that are fun to play but not fun to play against, effectively upending the game's balance with each new patch and give very little attention to bug fixing. The core game play of Paladins is fun... if everything aligns just right, which it rarely does. Currently, Paladins feels like it is on life support with Hi-Rez and Evil Mojo just milking what cash they can out of it. Stay away."

2788,mid ass game bruh
2789,why not
2790,"I used to love this game, although it was not a play for a long time. Now I decided to return, and was shocked by the fact that they removed the opportunity to play from the 3rd person.
For me, this game has always been a slasher with the shooter elements, but what kind of slasher with a first -person view? And then what's the point of buying skins if I see my character only a few seconds before the start of the battle?
I read the reviews of players for such a change. Some believe that the view from the third person is “cheat” (what is cheat if it is available to everyone), but many, like me, left or want to leave this game due to such a change.
I urge the developers to return the view from the third one at least in PVE."
2791,"simps crying , dead game with shitt ranks"
2792,Everytime I try and use my Xbox wireless controller the hero does nothing but turn left.  I had to look up online how to fix it and thought I found the problem.  It worked for a bit.  Next time I booted the game they started spinning left again.  This game has been a cause of frustration and they need to fix this bug.
2793,I've fallen out of love with the game but still better than Overwatch lol

2798,"Match making is unfair in ranked mode. Hi-rez despite several messages and more than $900 of support in his games are not able to answer a simple question. The game gets worse and worse over time. I have played more than 3000 hours at paladin after maximum 80 hours people are supposed to understand the game but the match making ranked does everything to keep players who do not know how to play. trolls and bots never get banned only people who have a difficult language. If you want to have a lot of bugs, a lot of crashes, a toxic community or several don'ts, I think Paladin is for you. I was banned for no reason and despite 3 messages to support, no developer can give me the duration of time or the reason etc.
perfect games not to be taken seriously which over time gets worse and worse."

now paladins is my new best friend"
2822,yes
2823,
2824,A really fun game. There's a diverse set of characters and they have their own personalities. The card system lets you altar your champion's abilities pre-game and there's an in-game credit system to upgrade your character more so it feels personalized. A lot of cosmetic options too.
2825,"Why are we still here... just to suffer... ooo is that the new anime skin, lemme reinstall real quick."

2841,"The game was fun and probably still is, but I recently relaunched it and found out there's now a battlepass system, which is already a red flag for me, not to mention they also removed the pass that allowed you access to all past and future characters, after I've already purchased it. That's $30 I'm never going to see again, and there was no refund or repayment whatsoever. Absolutely scum thing to do to your playerbase. I'm surprised there aren't more reviews discussing this but this game will now be permanently removed from my library due to the negligence of the Hi-Rez and Evil Mojo companies."
2842,I bought the $30 champion pack that stated i would own all champions that included future champions but because they removed that option to buy it i lost $30 and wont be getting all future champions. this game is literally a scam don't play it
2843,garbage game
2844,W game W team comp W hero balance W urrythang

2848,"Game is like a mix of League and Overwatch but the wal-mart brand. hard stuck Slivers in both games comes to this game and get high plat. game looks out dated as hell even when it came out in 2017. Even if this game is free to play just play League or wait for Overwatch 2. Not worth the pain. 
"
2849,Recommend playing if you like games like ability-based shooters. Some things like anti-healing/healing in general should be looked at but overall very fun.
2850,"It's kinda a fun game, balance is non existent tho"
2851,It's good.
2852,fun fun fun. so many different guns and abilities. so many characters
2853,"If you ever wanted to play overwatch for free this is it but you'll need to spend more time than you'll probably want in the game its very grandy not all of the heros are unlocked from the start and you'll start with some heros for free but the others are only buyable don't worry they don't cost real money you can buy them with coins that you get from normal games or emeralds that you can gain from tasks or buy with real money 
in addition to that it can sometimes feel unbalanced because one hero can take the whole game some heros are that over powered that they can wipe the whole enemy team if you play them right and seconds and I'm not kidding"

2892,"This game is a lot of fun. There are bugs that have been in the game for half a decade, but that's okay, it's still fun. The problem is that the community is about the most toxic people you can imagine. There's no way to turn off text chat, except by manually muting every player - Which I recommend you do as a general rule the moment a match starts. Waiting for that 1 out of 50 people in chat who won't start crapping on their team creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of an unwinnable game, is not worthwhile.
I do not recommend this game until the company hires a moderation team, because the people who play it are downright hostile, on the level of overwatch and league of legends."

2908,"This game was fun for quite a while, had a lot of potential and became more unique than playing Overwatch because the characters felt different than the others with their abilities. The Card Based system to improve your play style is also very fun, along with choosing which in-game buffs to buy during the rounds to let everyone choose how they play their Character. Healing felt really good in this game and as a Support Main through many games (This, OW, WoW, etc) - I really enjoyed it. However, they decided to get rid of Cauterize (a buyable healing debuff item to get in the round) and do an Overall Anti-Healing Debuff during games. 90% at 6-Minutes. This was a lazy cop-out to balance healing. It makes healing feel useless, and negated the entire point of Cauterize: A Focus-Fire debuff for team based shooting. It was a horrible decision, and the game was ruined. Some healers in this game are now rendered useless and it's just not fun to play at all. I'm seeing a lot of people drop this game because of it, and I hope HiRez reverses this decision and actually balance healing."

Balancing? Also not real, Androxus is the best flanker in the game right now and they decided to buff him next patch
Do not play this game, go play TF2 instead it will be more enjoyable."
2947,"Alright so here's an honest review from fresh eyes (33 hrs of gameplay at time of writing this).
If you're looking for completely polished graphics and gameplay, I would probably start looking elsewhere.
If you're looking for amazing or atleast good solo queues and a bustling community, again, i'd probably look elsewhere.
But if you are looking for a moderately balanced, slightly janky reminiscent of the likes of Team Fortress 2, FPS-style MoBA then boy do I have a treat for you.
Down to brass tacks yes this could be considered another Overwatch doppleganger that once again crumbled under the pressures of 'DLCs' and loot boxes, but personally I see it as a good precursor for where FPS MoBAs should have gone if not should have stayed. Yes I am seeing all the negative reviews from the oldies/day-oners of this game saying things like 'needs rework/balance' or 'I miss the old days' and I can understand where they're coming from being a TF2 Vet myself, but in all honesty stepping into this game without any expectation I've been pleasantly (although disparagingly) surprised. I will say there are some Champions that seem underworked comparatively but good team strat tends to overwhelm all else. 
All in all, at base price of absolutely nothing but your soul, I'm in.

Disclaimer, do not expect solo queuing to work in your favour, most people are either rubbish or insta-lock dmg then proceed to tell you that you are in fact the one throwing the game. ;)

EDIT; Sitting at a steady 200+ hours now and still thoroughly enjoying the game. Frankly quite surprised by the attitude of most of the community in-game, generally seems to be competent enough to have a good chat. Again i'll say specific heroes like Maeve or Skye are pretty OP and there's zero ranked servers. Still good game"
2948,Overwatch but fun

The gunplay is fine enough when you get used to it and the characters are overall interesting and dont feel at all unbalanced.

Matches can be fairly intense and the game modes on offer are good.

Nothing special, its manages to do well in its simplicy tho it is somewhat boring, which is strange considering the number of diffrent characters but all of them are so simple that they end up no mattering much.

Oh and the hitboxes are kinda crap but its not a big deal.

Maybe play it."

2966,ye it's chill
2967,"Paladins is a hero shooter that has a solid foundation. There are plenty of mechanically distinct characters that make the game sand above some other entries in the genre. Unfortunately there are plenty of downsides as well. There are bugs that range from small graphical or animation hiccups to miscoded challenges and incorrect damage numbers. As many gripes as I have with the game, I think that being a free-to-play title along with the good features it has makes the game worth checking out."
2968,This is a good alternative for Overwatch its got a wide range of fun heros to play and I thinky all of them are balanced

2982,HORRIBLE MATCH MAKING NEVER PLAY RANK THEY ARE VERY TOXIC AND THE SERVERS ARE HORRIBLE
2983,"very fun. like overwatch but free, or tf2 but gets updates."
2984,"It's Overwatch but fun (Like TF2!), and the characters are unashamedly attractive.  Characters play *very* differently from each other, with abilities changing things up pretty dramatically - though it *is* still a shooter at its core (well, for most characters anyway).  No hard counter is ever a hard-walled rock-paper-scissors I-win-you-lose game changer, unlike in [COMPETITOR] - which is especially nice since you don't swap characters mid-match (though you *can* spec differently on the fly to adapt to the situation on the ground).

Much more focus on abilities than in [COMPETITOR] - you get to spam a lot of wild stuff, depending on who you are.  Plenty of ways to customize your gameplay to carve new playstyles which they won't see coming.  Devs take a lot more risks than most other large games you'll see today.  I continually see new, super out-there things I'd never have expected or imagined, and my first thought is always ""that's super cool - they'd never dream of doing that in [COMPETITOR]"".

Wildly well-supported.  If you played it way back when, the bugs have been squashed, it's nicely polished now, and the cast is getting pretty big.  We're up to like 55+ champions now, and each champ can be specced so many different ways that you'll craft new playstyles you've never seen before, on the regular.  Can't remember the last bug I encountered, & I've crashed maybe... once every 40h of game time?  Doesn't matter anyway since it pops you right back into the same game when you relaunch.  Skins are wild and very out there - not at all conservative like [COMPETITOR].  They completely change characters' looks, voice commands, weapons, weapon/ability particle effects, all in really fun ways.  It's worth learning the buttons to communicate stuff in your characters' own voices - even if you aren't being tactical with it, they're fun and have a lot of charm on a per-skin basis.

You can earn all the characters without ever paying a dime, but if you find you like it well enough for long enough, it's like $20 for every champion all at once, forever, which is a steal - with the game refunding you the in-game gold you spent to acquire each character before you paid for all of them at once.  Community's a lot more positive & fun to play with than they used to be.  Just don't play ranked.  It's containment.

Oh and there's a dude who plays like Call of Duty, if you just wanna stomp all the losers with their fancy-fangled abilities and such.  ""Viktor"".  His abilities are literally Sprint, ADS, Fire, (none of which have cooldowns) and he can throw a grenade every once in a while.  Rather different from most else, but familiar if you need a jumping-off point before you go down the rabbit hole of WHAT ON EAR-"
2985,Paladins is an interesting case of when a f2p clone of a larger AAA game actually manages to outshine the original

You can literally get stuck with 4 bots shooting at the wall on your team while the enemy team is MLG spawnin killing you. 1 champ picked me up as soon as I spawned in over and over for example. I see why this is fun, but is also anti competitive at the core."
3001,"woohooo

edit: woooooooooooooohoooooooooooooooooo"
3002,was fun until they gave everyone heal cut for free. actually the worst change
3003,"(Update to my review)

No idea if there was an update or something but bot matches is now even more retarded with the enemy bots not just snapping to you and using all their abilities like they read your control input but now have insane inelegance with the bot's flanking the player and blocking their line of sight if they are shooting from a hidden area. If feels as instead of lowering them like they heavily need they instead must of been made impossible to even fight against most of the time now, Team AI is still dumb as ever with them walking slow for no reason or running back and forth or just in to walls, seen them also just run up to an enemy and stand there letting them kill them without even shooting back.

Had an onslaught match 389 to 15. almost won hitting 400 but all of a sudden the enemy AI changed mid game same with my team and the enemy just wouldn't budge once they ran in and took the point with my team no longer fighting for the point and feeding the enemy team. A match I wanted over now lasted twice as long as I had to let the enemy AI go from 15 to 400 well my team was stuck on 389 just needing a few points to win.

This game needs a fucking change to it's AI with the team being buffed and the enemy being extremely nerfed.

Also controller has awful aim assists with me trying it and it pulling my camera away from a group to aim at one guy moving off to the point it's almost an aim bot.



(Old reivew)
Good game, fun for a hero shooter, it's a free to play so it doesn't hurt to try it out and with overwatch dying off this is the better game to play, 

There are problems with some characters being balanced where some can just delete players and instantly gain health or become immortal as soon as they are close to dying to then act as if nothing happened.

They add new characters and maps which is nice and they have a game mode that changes every so often with just some game mode to play like hide and seek to spice it up which is nice.

Bot match is completely broken and just stressful most of the time. The team Bot will run in to walls and struggle to do basic actions like shoot the enemies though they will shoot the wall's at spawn fine enough. The enemy AI is just pure broken and will delete the player and their team with pin point accuracy as well as just instantly being back at max, also from a few matches I think the Bot's will straight up brake the games rules and just enable invincibility on characters that don't have it as well as teleport behind it in an instance even if the character has no such ability. 

Enemy AI is either normal difficulty or hit scan never miss and not even letting you leave spawn unfairness.

One problem other then the completely broken AI is healing, the game for some stupid reason has an anti healing thing that debuffs all healing which ends up making healing feel so pointless as well as a bonus of healers making little reward since killing is what is needed really pushing the hole playing healer is just more crippling yourself to a useless roll and to earn barely nothing.

Other then that it's good all around and fun."

I've tried troubleshooting the game multiple times from multiple sources online but at a point i don't want to have to learn how to code to fix my problem. If you have any other consoles to download the game by all means go ahead but this should just be removed from steam altogether if the game can't be played after downloading. Beyond unsatisfied."

3024,"First of all its Free, you can try it yourself and see if you're going to enjoy it.. don't let the others confuse you, ""Just Do It"" its free anyways, as well as the uninstall button if you didn't like it.

I love the game, its fun to play, but i hope there will be a lot of game modes anytime soon or a thrilling and new content that can actually stay, not just new skins, packs etc etc."

3026,pretty fun game.

3030,"i cant launch the game damn

3031,Overwatch for brokes
3032,"I would absolutely recommend this game to new people to team fps, and people that have played TF2 and overwatch alike. this game is easy to pick up with tons of characters, and hard to master with the additions of mechanics unique to specific characters. I love mal'damba and have gotten him to level eleven. this game feels like a remix of TF2 and overwatch, with you not being able to change characters in a round (somewhat like TF2 with mains), and having a honestly absurd amount of characters (sorta like overwatch, but so, SO much more). This game is fun on levels that i think are quite hard to see for a free fps (yes i know team fortress exists, but that game is simply legendary. nothing can quite compare). I love this game, thank you devs!"
3033,"this game is fun, but its somewhat buggy, i didnt get my 50k gold by completing vivian challenges, please evil mojo give me my 50k i wanna buy zhin"
3034,"Really good arena shooter. Played a lot when I first build my PC years ago and decided to randomly jump back into it. A lot of different champions in the game which feels slightly overwhelming. Just go into training and see who's worth your time to unlock. The base champions are really good, but I am finding some pretty good unlockable ones as well. You don't have to pay to unlock, but it takes some time. Luckily the rewards per game feel like it's worth putting the time in."
3035,its good when tf2 is riddled by bots
3036,"The gameplay aged really well, and I find myself coming to Paladins more often than Overwatch."

3062,"An always interesting Hero shooter, With fast and nice gameplay, And optionally even high FOV too for just more satisfying gameplay
The Champions design is always amazing and innovative, It consistently gets updates, adding champions and gameplay changes
The in-game item system, as well as champion modifications, Are not too complicated, But they make for a lot of fun trying different builds that you can make yourself, New ideas too that can work!
Paladins as a game is so great and the only thing it suffers from is, it can be better optimized
It's closest alternative would be overwatch, Which doesn't have as much as paladins to offer, And isn't updated as regularly either. And it doesnt have nice champions to try with customized modifications on them to try for yourself
Paladins is certainly worth playing, And the dev team is doing great job with all the designs, We only hope to see better optimizations too 
But not that it's unplayable now, It still runs better than certain AAA games
Also paladins has everything in the game free to get, And only cosmetics are what you can pay for with real money
And the currency for those cosmetics can be acquired with in-game progress/bounties, As well as with logging into the game, So one can get the cosmetics too for free"

3089,"Very fun team shooter, have played this for years and still continue to enjoy it.

Also, unlike Overwatch, didn't slowly become a worse game and then release a ""sequel"" which is literally just a patch with a weird choice of marketing campaign alongside an entirely different PvE game.

Sadly, however, took a pretty interesting concept of a battle royale gamemode with the characters that are in THIS game (which I genuinely wanted to play) and turned it into a pretty shoddy spin-off game that is very generic and by this point long dead, for (imo) good reason. Keep in mind that I'm not the kind of person to actually be interested in battle royales, aside from ones that are special and unique enough to catch my eye (Spellbreak, you deserved better).

But regardless, the game itself in its current state is definitely worth playing in its own right, and is still consistently and reliably getting updated to this day after years. Definitely worth at least trying if you're interested, and stopping if you don't enjoy. (Oh, and I am an entirely free-to-play player. The only DLC I got was a really cool free DLC that they did during an event a while ago, which is still very appreciated even if its not still running)"

3101,"Its never balanced but its fun.  Like any team based game the right team can make an easy victory, while a bad team is 20 min wasted.  Interesting toon abilities with customization to your play style.  Its worth trying as it is free to play and if you like it you can sink more into it.  But don't expect balanced gameplay or people to know how to play on a team."
3102,"its a good battel game
"
3103,"This is by far the most mixed feelings I've ever had on a game. On the one hand, it's a broken, buggy mess. It regularly crashes, glitches out, and breaks. The balancing is way off to the point where some characters and comps feel near impossible to play against. Its artstyle is off-putting and some of the characters range from ugly to kinda problematic. 

But my word. Get past all of that, and you have one of the most fun video games i've ever played. The gameplay feels fluid and fun without being that overwhelming, and each of the roles feel pronounced and have their own important job. While people tend to point out a lot of similarities between this game and overwatch, the character designs still feel very unique. You have a goblin in a flying wooden mech, a man that can stop and rewind time, an army commander that can launch people in the sky with an arm cannon, and a universe-devouring worm. And that's just the tanks. But i think the best part about this game is the customisation. Each character has 3 talents, and 16 cards that alter the way they play. Some of them do feel either redundant or downright useless, but most of the time, it means that 2 people can play the same character in completely diffrent ways. For example, my main, Ruckus, is a tank with booster jets and the ability to generate a shield for himself. One loadout I have for him includes a talent that increases the shield's health to give him some of the highest HP in the game, and a card that lets me activate that shield again after just 5 seconds. This makes him very hard to take down without a co-ordinated attack, and makes holding down the point a lot easier. Another build I have lets his booster jets take him directly upwards, as well as forwards at a much greater distance. This means that, with enough practice, you can get to wherever you want on the map, flank around geometry, and be one of the most mobile characters in the game while still having tank levels of defence. That's just one example from one of the simpler characters in the game. With around 50 characters in the game, each with their own customizability, plus in-game items similar to a MOBA, no 2 people are going to be playing a character the exact same way. 

I could write an entire essay about this game (and maybe I will some day), but for now i'll leave it at this:

Paladins is one of the most fun, creative, and unique ideas for an FPS i've ever seen. But it's an absolute mess. Part of me really hopes we see a complete rework from the ground up, letting everyone see just how good of a game it really is. But for now, give it a chance. I almost want to say it's worth it."
3104,make me wanna kms
3105,"Eh, Its a really nice PVP Team shooter but its ruined by poor maps and a even poorer anti-cheat that they wont even spend the time enforcing. The developers have all but every once in a blue moon abandoned. But they're known for that so it's not really that big of a surprise."
3106,"overwatch but its free
roblox arsenal with rtx on
best game"
3107,good game
3108,yeet
3109,better than overwatch for sure
3110,"This game has a very ugly colour scheme. Make it nicer to look at, please devs :)"
3111,"It will become more fun for the new players when you start to learn the champs and the perks in the game.
"
3112,"excelent game
"
3113,"Its alright.

There are a lot of things to take from Paladins. 

The champions vary and the gameplay is fine to an extent. They are unique and most of their abilities are fun. The biggest problem is that there are too many counters to certain champions which makes them unable to come out, ever. Great examples for this are Vivian, Sha Lin, Skye, etc. They are still played from time to time but they don't perform well most of the time.

As a competitive player, the ranked scene is kind of a joke and isn't taken very seriously. Players are very toxic in Paladins and the finding hackers is quite rare and if you do and go on to report them, there isn't a direct option like ""Cheating"" or ""Hacking"" which I find extremely odd. 

This is not the only little flaw you will find in Paladins. There is a tornado of small bugs and glitches which don't get fixed ever. The developers lead us to believe that they are merely trying to profit from the former glory of a promising title. 

It is sad to enter after a new update has dropped and all that is added are new counters to your favorite champion, a few overly sexualized skins and a few annoying adjustments which help ""Improve"" the game.

I started playing around November 2021 and I managed to climb to Diamond within my playtime which is evidence that the competitive scene is not that serious. I could easily climb to Master and eventually Grandmaster if I invest a little more time. I've watched Paladins competitive and it looks extremely fun and I wish I could perform like that but at the same time there is so much time needed to invest for seemingly no reward.

In general, Paladins is fine to play casually and temporarily. It's got a lot of flaws and the developers don't seem to focus on fixing them. There are almost no maps being added, there is a lot of problems with character selection, etc., though in the end, not everyone cares about that and Paladins offers a large variety of fun characters for every playstyle.

I would NOT recommend this game in its current state."
3121,"very fun game , I think anyone could get into it , its not fairly hard nor easy and its just a great vibe game"
3122,It's budget Overwatch but even more buggy. Do with that what you will.
3123,the community can be really toxic when you're just trying to have fun on the casual game modes. just ignore them and enjoy the game. :D
3124,Good Game..
3125,"This is the most over sexualized game I've ever played in my entire life. There are like 23 different female characters in the game and they all look like they came straight out of a playboy magazine or a porn shoot. I'm not exaggerating, some of them are wearing lingerie and bdsm outfits, and I think one of them is actually just wearing a piece of rope for a bra.

There is way too much porn everywhere on the internet, and the last thing I want to have is a bunch of sl,,utty, hyper-sexualized, anime ho,,es on one of the few places where I'm supposed to be able to be free of all that. Combine that, and all the gay pride flags the game gives you as in-game avatars, and you've got a big red thumbs down. Which is unfortunate because the game itself isn't that bad. The character mechanics are ok, and it's a free game!

Pretty shocked to see the CCP allow tencent to do this kinda thing.  In a sane world, the devs and executives would be put on trial for crimes against humanity.

Very shameful Mr. Xi. I thought you were better than this."

3153,"Ive been playing this game since Open Beta 17, and I loved it then. With each new patch they add faster and faster flanks, and character with auto-aim abilities, while doing absolutely nothing to balance earlier champions against them. You've got characters like Drogoz with super slow rocket speed up against flanks that are absolutely impossible for him to hit. The devs need to address their older champions if theyre going to keep adding new champions that completely counter everything theyre up against. Also, auto-aim champions like Lian and Lex are absolutely killing the game and should be removed."

I've been in on Paladins for a while and the Devs have seemingly abandoned the game except as a money mine. Trying to report BOTS is impossible, probably to pad player numbers. This was the most fun hero-shooter I've ever played, and I feel sad that it is slowly being ruined. I recommend this to anyone, but don't spend money and learn form my mistake."

3190,"I have to give this a 4/5. Why? Because it's a GOOD game! It's just not always my cup o tea... and I like my tea...

The gameplay is solidly built following the mechanics of Team Fortress 2 and Overwatch, the playerbase is just as toxic as League of Legends, but better than Activision-Blizzard's Overwatch... I see this game out-living not only OverWatch, but OverWatch2... with more updates, more heroes and villains, and generally better playability and customizations.

Wanna play a Zarya-Esque character? Ash has you covered even better!
Wanna play a Reaper? Androxus.
Wanna play a Dwarf with a turret? Barik is your man... er... Dwarf.

3211,This game is free so you dont have to spend money. I think this game is worth a try if you like quick pace games.

3213," suffers from most issues of MOBAS pay to get good champ and good champ powerful, free rotation champ ok tho but there are game where the nicer champs are def stronger"
3214,where's my old acc
3215,"Interestingly I have found this game to be a breath of fresh air after jumping between so many games. Personally if I had to think of problems I've run into it would only be that the start up can be a little finicky at times and that the cosmetics in the game can be kind of a hassle. P.S. If you really want a skin stick to the lootboxes with a small prize pool or wait for bundles. Bundles give you plenty of cosmetics plus lootboxes at a fraction of the cost. It's way more worth it to grind out cosmetics with that. Also theoretically the deal of the day is always unique to you and will give you a chance at cosmetics you don't own so eventually it will show up there too. Outside of that the gameplay has been very enjoyable it's pretty quick paced and the matches don't take that long which I like. It's small doses that don't feel like they drag which was a problem in Overwatch for those who might be comparing the two. I would say if you enjoyed Overwatch or TF2 or really any team shooter you will enjoy this as well. Plus for those who crave a little more from their shooter this game delivers on customizing your champions. Unlike in Overwatch you can specialize your champions to be particularly potent in their roll which is kinda like a game within a game, at least if you like trying new builds and seeing how they perform to compliment your playstyle. I find that part in particular to be the best selling point for this game. You can really get creative or just meme with your characters meaning even if both teams have the exact same comp they will hardly ever be playing it the exact same way. With all the little things you can do with your character it can keep the game feeling much more fresh even if you're like me who sticks mainly to one character. Personally despite all my hours in Overwatch I must say that I prefer this game in almost every way. It may not be as pretty and it does lack a certain polish that Overwatch had but honestly that doesn't bother me in the least. It is easily a game I know I will sink many more hours into and if you're fine with a semi-serious but also free spirited team shooter that is actually fun then I am certain you will too if you give the game a chance."
3216,"     It's still a great game to play casually, but it is rapidly losing players because of the way balance is handled these days. There used to be minor tweaks and adjustments to certain aspects of the game that would either subtly improve the game or make it worse to a small degree. 

     Now it appears that they longstanding balance issues that caused serious strife in the community, such as the problem with anti heal being a requirement at higher levels, and just drastically change it in ways that have remarkably profound impacts on the game. They recently added global anti-heal that scales with in game time, to replace anti-heal as a purchasable item in game. I can't speak for how it impacted the meta, but these changes seriously impacted the games total player count and it continues to drop. 

     Instead of reverting or altering these changes in any way, they instead seem to be interested in implementing radical changes to their core game mode that has been rarely changed for years. I respect that they want to innovate with their content, but changing foundational things about a game that has been standing strong for years is not the way to go about it. Especially when these changes are causing a mass exodus from the game.

     You can see my playtime and look up my stats in the game. I've played a long time and I haven't played at the highest level of play at any point, but I have done well in the game and have understood the game pretty well for years, and it is clear to me that the game is just not worth investing significant time into as a game to play at a high level. I still think fun can be had, but for me the fun has been dwindling over the past year or so, and I uninstalled the game earlier this year. I hope to see a time when the game is something that I can get back into with my friends, but for now I have to wait and post this review to warn anyone about the ridiculous changes that have been happening, and are continuing to happen to this game.
"
3217,ok
3218,Everytime I download this game it doesn't work and I cant play with my friend.

3224,"Paladins is a wonderful game, once you get over the matchmaking algorithm. The system's built-in need to keep your win rate around 50% will put you against some ridiculous opponents, but the game itself is quite amazing! The customizablity of the individual champions, on both asthethic and in-game use, is otherworldly! One can change your champions passives from cards in so many different ways, the combinations reach well within the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of different loadouts. Then, you can change the skin of your champion, the weapon, emotes, sprays, and mounts! The aiming system is easy to get used to, changeable in the options menu for your weapon cursor. My only 2 other big complaints to warn new players of is the passive anti-healing that is in each match (mind you, it's quite high as of May 23rd, 2022) and the amount of money some of the chests to earn cosmetics is a little high.. 
Other than that, this game is a better version of Overwatch, in my opinion, and anyone who plays games in the genre of Overwatch should definitely try Paladins! You won't regret it, I can almost guarantee it!"
3225,"If your like me and don't want to waste your sweet sweet cold hard cash on overwatch get this game which is pretty much just like overwatch, way more fun and enjoyable with friends or solo, and you can easily unlock everything just by playing."
3226,It is a fun game.
3227,"Moji,Zhin,Drogoz,lizzo,tiber,ect"
3228,"I bought the 39.99 full version on the Nintendo Switch. I do not regret it. It is a super fun shooter to play, adn with the version I got I still get all the new champions. And speaking of champions (the different characters you can play as) there are A LOT, which may be downside. Only other downsides are that nobody uses the vc and from my experience ranked match queues take a looooooong time. 8.5/10"

3242,i like this game it makes me a very happy person
3243,"overall pretty fine game, I would love to see more people play it tho so give it a try
"
3244,"I'd much rather play Overwatch for another 10 years with absolute no sort of update than touch this heaping trash again. Yes, there's a ton of different champions but almost none of them have any playability besides a select few which are constantly just the only ones you EVER fight against. Thought this would be a lot better but it's just terrible."
3245,if I would choose to be an animal I would choose to be paladins
3246,"A game that gets a lot of negativity for being ""too much like Overwatch"".  A ton of potential ran by a shoddy dev team, it gives an alternative to players looking to escape Overwatch for the time being.  Constant character releases leading to constant balance issues, no maps or new modes, and a stale ranked queue.  And at the same time, bombarding you with MTX in a poorly designed UI.  Looking past all of the issues the talent/loadout system for all characters can make your gameplay unique but there are definitely meta builds per patch that could be better than any other combo.  And a playerbase, when coming from more ""competitive"" games, that can make you look like a god when you're up against them.

Is it fun?  Sure.  But it is wasted potential in its own way and a damn shame."

ѕhіtty and imbalanced Matchmaking will be the full course meal when you decided to play this game.

Overpowered new heroes, tons of fuсking bugs that makes Bethesda, DICE and Grove Street game blushed.

Ѕhіtty map, ѕhіtty UI, ѕhitty teammate, hell even you yourself will turns into ѕhіt if you decide to play this fuсking reject.

Oh, and don't forget fuсking debuffs try to play as a healer like me with 90% healing debuff, i rather play The Last of Us 2 jacking off to those mentally ill people having sex."

3265,"The best first person MOBA since Battleborn, in my opinion, and its free!"
3266,"You can see how many hours I have spent playing this game, And see that obviously I either love it or that I don't have a life. Really the game it self is a great hero shooter with a mostly easy to learn but hard to master gameplay, that with time rewards you with a great sense of accomplishment after you get your first quadruple kill! Plenty of characters and a new one with each battle pass that only cost $7.99 compared to some other games where a pass could cost twice as much. The devs are really good about listening to the community and doing their best about fixing and balancing the gameplay and characters. The bugs that this game is known for are not as bad as some people try to play up and really are more funny than game breaking. There is really something for everyone is this game and truth be told paladins has helped me though some tough times and for that I love it! And honestly it is a Free to play and not a pay to win game and I love it and hope someone reading this will try it and maybe love it as much as I do!"

3272,free overwatch
3273,"Many people compare this game to overwatch, but having played both I can safely say at this current time I would without a doubt rather play paladins. Paladins is a fun and wacky game to play with friends. The characters are unique and fun to play (Yagorath is a fitty 😍😍). I cant lie, if you play this game alone then seek help but if you have a group of friends that can make the dullest and most heartbreaking of matches a fun and exciting time then your sorted for life #bigup. Quite frankly paladins will stick with me 4life as a game I can always rely on for a good time ;)."
3274,"actual fucking ass across all fields. the power-creep with new champs is always annoying, there's always a clear meta, bugs are so common that they're just- accepted and ignored. not to mention the stupid number of skins and cosmetics, that make a good base a total cash grab. I've put time into this because I am able to ignore the mountains of flaws. let me say that, if I had the money for overwatch when I wanted paladins, I should've gotten that instead. overall, the gameplay is addictive. of course it is. but I cannot recommend anyone take this game up seriously, just play something else. I'm getting so sick of their notoriously bad matchmaking."
3275,yeah i care
3276,do play its fun ggs all around
3277,ye
3278,"Honestly one of the most entertaining class based shooters you can play. You don't need too much knowledge to play well, good anti-cheat, tons of fun.

I will say that their are a lot of purchases for content (Specifically the characters) but you don't need to purchase them with money which is awesome honestly."

3305,"Looks like despite the years Hi-Rez still has no idea what they want to do with this game. Which isn't bad at all as it means they're still adding and changing things. As of the game itself: All of their games have this feeling of perfect mediocrity - they're not amazing but also aren't bad at all in the attempt to take their own slice out of the cake that was a popular multiplayer genre at the time.

Their own idea on hero shooter is pretty good. We have multiple very distinct champions both gameplay and theme wise. Playstyle is customizable with the card-loadout system and even in-game with an item shop so you can adapt to the situation on the map. Maps are diverse in both length and verticality which has to be taken into account when picking champions as some will not feel as good on certain maps. Multiple game modes from standard capture and push cart to just a deathmatch...overall there is stuff to do, try out, learn or tinker with combining into quite complex but accessible experience if you wish to get the bottom of it. Of course mind you it's all PvP and it comes with all its innate quirks. No direct solo play although match-made AI games and shooting range are available.
This game [i]has[/i] a universe and lore, however, the game is not very good at showing it or directing to sources of it...unless champion Bio and trailers is all there is.

While I truly cannot put my claw on what prevents this game from being truly amazing or making me want to stay for longer than a few days before another longer break I do can point a one major flaw I can see. This would be its business model. It's not P2W, you can't buy power here and the cosmetic customization is greatly developed (announcer packs, death cards, login screens, mounts and so much more aside regular skins) not even mentioning them not being afraid to try all the themes and tastes (even furries, yes :3). The problem is how it's all organized. There are very few items you can get by a direct purchase. A lot of things are limited/exclusive, bound to battle passes and majority of the other cosmetic content is packed into multiple RNG chests so you have to buy multiple chests and hope you will roll the right skin out of 10 within it. 
It becomes a real problem if you only want 1 item and would mind rolling any other and the fact that you can't have duplicates therefore being able to ""milk"" the loot pool doesn't really help matters. Similar issue is with payed bundles - they contain lots of things but you may be interested in only 1. I swear I'd spend more if I could directly get things I'd like to possess to have my little ultimate profile and/or a preferred skin for each champion I like to play...but then I had say ""meh"" and not waste my budget on spinning the wheel...IF I could spin the wheel for certain items because as mentioned some are very scarcely available for no good reason. I can only think of impulse buying because ""you will lose the opportunity"" (and thus all that dragon/furry-bait goes to waste, your loss Hi-Rez :p).

Alright, that took a little too long. If cosmetics matter is irrelevant to you and you seek something different from Overwatch or TF2 you sure should see if it's up your alley. It's pretty good and enjoyable even if not that spectacular feeling overall...how do you call things like this... good/fine wood? It's not stiff though :3"
3306,its pretty good
3307,"IMHO this is the better overwatch,its just that you need to unlock the champion"
3308,lol
3309,i like going tank every game it makes me depressed
3310,"Very fun game, but I would say it is almost required to buy the starter edition to have fun. The game gets too boring without more champs and takes too long to get more at the beginning."
3311,"yes
"
3312,Its like Overwatch 2 but actually available. OW 2 is stealing the 5v5 meta from paladins
3313,theres woman in this game
3314,"This game is absolutely terrible yet I keep coming back because some terrible games are so much fun. The balancing in this game is shot considering some characters which are designed to pick off healers or people at low health, can solo the tanks. The shop system inside matches is fun (for the love of God please bring back cauterize tho), the highly customizable card system is extremely fun, and the talents range from being fun and gimmicky to straight up broken (Maeve's street justice talent). I love this game tho. I have been playing for 4 years across two systems (switch and steam). No matter how many times I rage quit due to nonsense, die to an annoying flank (Skye, Maeve, Talus) which people claim take skill, find a bug that makes the game unplayable (the straight up temporarily removed a character for a bit because it was causing crashes), the game crashes, or get floored due to poor team composition, I will come back. This game is a game for masochists. 2/10 worst free game I have ever played but so much fun."

3325,i love this game ive played it mostly on playstation and not a lot on here because the cross progression doesnt work for playstation to pc but i love games like overwatch and this game has been (in my opinion) a good replacement for when i get sick of it lots of content and its fun and it combines my favorite things of overwatch and league of legends.

7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

3330,"There's always new characters being added to the roster. It's both a good and bad thing.

Bad: poorly balanced characters

3363,must download!
3364,i only installed for the engineer gaming skin and now i like it
3365,"Paladins is one of those games I wish we had a Maybe option for.

It's fun. It's a lot like overwatch (which has better maps tbh) but matchmaking is so much faster so you're always able to find a game, and when you get a balanced game its a lot of fun, and the optimization is top notch. Like I've seen less graphically intense games demand more CPU and GPU power than this, so yeah this thing will probably run on a potato too which is a point above overwatch.

Ignoring the F2P bullshit microtransactions (thankfully all cosmetic sans heroes) this game is riddled with matchmaking problems. You will almost never have a match you look back on and say ""both teams were evenly balanced"" you'll either be slaughtering everyone like a pro gamer in a pub stomp with a high coordinated team, or getting pub stomped by pro gamers as your team of nooblets rage quits around you leaving you with bots. OH and you can't just leave a match without fully closing the game... It's like they know rage quits are gonna happen and chose to make leaving a match require you to close the game as the solution instead of fixing the matchmaking, but its still more convient to close the damn game and relaunch it than it is to put up with awful unbalanced matchmaking that gives me flashbacks of high school jocks v nerds dodgeball. But if you can put up with that (I can some days) this game is a lot of fun. If you can't put up with bad match making you're gonna end up speed balling your controller or mouse through your TV/monitor."

3375,"Overall Review - 9/10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review...
I first got this game because I was tired of playing Overwatch with the same hero's and same maps every game. I got this expecting a trash Overwatch knock off but was actually surprised to find out the opposite. This game is arguably better than Overwatch in a lot of ways. I feel like a lot of the characters are more fun to play than Overwatch this game gets way more updates than Overwatch and also siege mode (payload) is better made than Overwatch. Siege really highlights what makes this game better than Overwatch. With payload spawning in the middle of a mirrored map and teams fighting over control to be able to push it into their spawn feels a lot more balanced and fun than Overwatch. Also 5 v 5 feels a lot better than 6 v 6 and the card system and in game shop add enough verity to have a different experience when you want it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Downfalls...
Graphically this game is not as good as Overwatch it feels a little less polished than it with some textures looking a little worse than I would like. Also because its free to play you are gonna spend a lot of time saving up the in game currency to buy champions. They will take you a while to grind out which isn't very fun but the game is free to play so hard to complain about that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
You Wont Like This Game If...
You don't like learning new more complex systems compared to Overwatch. Its much more difficult to play ranked because it takes a long time to get the required amount of champions in order to be eligible for ranked.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Value: 9/10
This game is free so give it a try as for how well the game is made its definitely worth a play. The only things that take away from the value is the in game grind for some of the champions is annoying but they are all purchasable for free.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final Thoughts...
Paladins is a great game and its free to play so there really isn't a reason to give it a try. As long as you can look past the minor imperfections with the textures and graphics, don't mind learning some of the card system and the in match shop and don't mind grinding for champions you'll have a great time playing it."

3428,"With over 1000 hours in Paladins on PS4, Battlepass's purchased, Skins bought, Characters unlocked and levelled up through hours and hours of grinding. I am deeply disappointed due to one thing and it's not really even the dev's fault. 

I am now a PC player and no longer have a console yet I'm unable to transfer my account progress with all it's purchases, heroes unlocked, levels etc over from PS4 to PC. Even if they gave us like a one time opportunity to do it I'd be more then happy as I never plan to go back to console gaming.

Screw Sony, the greedy, stuck up bastards. Anyway I have to give this game thumbs down for now until I'm able to once again play on my account which I've got my purchases and progress on. Fortnite is completely cross-progression so I hope paladins can either go down that route with Sony somehow or give us a 1 time chance to transfer our accounts over"
3429,when you're winning it's great. when you're losing it's because of your toxic teammates or your lack of skill. so long story short if you can go numb to outright hate speech and crushing losses due to bugs/toxicity/skill issue then the game is pretty fun

3442,"I'm sad this game is judged so harshly by it's distant cousin from Blizzard. It's not as polished, as Overwatch, sure. But it is updated WAY more, than Overwatch. The champions are diverse and KEEP COMING!

By my example: As healer main I fail to see such creativity in supports. And they're not the only ones!

The game evolves as much, as it is allowed to. Tries it's very best. Give it a shot - it's worth it!

Cons? Oh, obviously it's not perfect. Some bugs, problems happen during the game, but where they don't happen? Toxicity? It's a PvP game - toxicity is bound to happen. And it's still less, than some more successful shooters! Way less!

It can and wants to grow. Improve. And has one of the most active communities out there, too! Artists, pro players - you name it! Small, but very welcoming, loyal community.

So pull up a chair and try!"
3443,is gd

3446,"game is good, dead community, and dead servers"
3447,"My first experience with paladins was on xbox one, my brothers introduced it to me as a free overwatch alternative and i instantly loved to play. even after my family got overwatch, paladins still held a special place in my heart. I stopped playing after a while.

I got back into it after getting a switch. It was one of the best free games I had ever played so ofc I would get it again. I played a lot with my friends, but when my friends started playing less so did I, and i eventually dropped it again.

It wasnt until new years, where i downloaded it on my pc that i really fell in love with the game. I purchased and downloaded overwatch months ago but still have yet to even open the game, whenever i think of opening it I just open paladins instead.

of course having played the game for years I have had many problems with it. my wifi runs much slower than your average gamers and so thats where most of my issues are. the glitches that i experience when my wifi is struggling make me want to rage quit.

the community is very toxic. obviously theres good people and bad people in every nook and cranny of the world, but I experienced more sexism and racism there than anywhere else. I know that paladins supports the LGBTQ+ and the game has great diversity and incredible characters.

super fun to play with friends!!"

3458,Free Overwatch
3459,"I used to love this game I've played it since forever, and for a free game it's absolutely great! But there are many things that keep this game from being a real game that people actually talk about and play.

The matchmaking is terrible. If you're remotely decent at this game get ready to carry and teach you're entire team almost every single match for some reason. But it's bad like that in a lot of games these days so... Grab three friends to play with and it won't be so bad.

Over time they've added really strange characters that have completely ruined the balance of the game literally every time they patch it. Character powers change and lore grows stranger and cringier with every addition.

They used to have a cool market and reward system but that was long ago replaced by a greedy worthless micro-transaction system. Gotta make money I guess...

There's like 4 maps in this game and it's been out forever. Seriously how hard is it to add more maps to this game? SMH

The UI and menu used to be really pretty and nice to look at but then they changed it so now all the menus look like poorly programmed VB stuff.

They used to have an MVP play at the end of every match but it got so glitchy that they had to remove it from the game because they don't know how that stuff works I guess?

The 'new' game modes are always pointless recycled crap.

This game used to be good but now it's basically unplayable trash, just save your time and go buy Overwatch or something lol idk."

3. give me a reason to play the game. currently the only thing is the event pass which has 24 levels that lasts for almost 2 months. the event pass only has 2 skins and a recolor for each. 
4. the least likely to be changed but the ingame item store the one where you purchase upgrades is such a shitty feature in my opinion but the whole game has been balanced around it so its not really possilbe to change"

3481,"This game can be fun playing customs or casuals with your friends.The competitive/ranked part of this game sucks, it doesn't matter if you are diamond, master or even grandmaster the ranks will be extremely random from game to game. The game is filled with various bugs such as the inf loading bug which is impossible to not get on EU servers at least.There is a semi fix for it but honestly queuing for 8 min picking and banning then being unable to start the game due to some built in drophack that occurs every 10 games or so is kind of disappointing. Queuing up against cheaters this doesn't happen every game but is noticable again at least on the EU servers from my experience. Not everything is bad tho they have very fun champions with kits that make the game pretty enjoyable. This is my experience with the game after around 300 hours of playing on different accounts."

Fun little game, big 30GB download for mid graphics. 90% of the playable characters are locked behind hefty gold price tags. Weird menu, requiring play to join friends and does NOT support Steam friends, after 6 years.
I have played for 2 hours on great hardware and current drivers, and I had to restart four times because of the bugs. I created my account in 2017 yet it requires me to log in with a new email address and doesn't give me the 1 year achievement. P2W content and countless expensive skins bloat this game up to the moon, without asking the community or enabling custom downloads. GTFO HIREZ!!!"

3494,"This is what Overwatch 1 tried to be, something casual but with a competitive aspect for those specific people. Competitive is more or less balanced with requirements of having enough characters learned being at least lvl 15 for each character, also picks bans are a thing (which is amazing). This game gets a lot of hate for how these characters are balanced, but when everyone is over powered its balanced. Learning the characters is essential if you want to take this game serious with understanding the Rock/Paper/Scissors aspect of countering heroes. Quick Play is for casual and learning/lvling those new heroes.

Yes, I would recommend this game:)"

This game really just needs some polishing and it would absolutely be the best champion/hero shooter.

3550,"non stop balance issues combined with non stop favoritism of the creator with playable characters making the game no longer fun to play healers are bad for healing and most are only used for damage build with 1 or 2 being usable while the damage get the main focus in the game for updates and tanks being second to that
overwatch or any other game would be better until the issues are fixed which will prob never happen"
3551,Best shooter game in the world 100% recamend
3552,"overwatch for broke people
"
3553,mid overwatch but free
3554,yes good
3555,i would wait to see what direction the devs take before investing money in this game. after 3 years and 730 hours and the game feels like its dying...
3556,Fuck this game bruh. Only reason I have it is because of the homie.
3557,"People like to say this is a knock off of Overwatch. The reality is, this is a far superior game with a far more dedicated team (despite their wildly smaller size). Instead of investing in a sequel for a cash grab from fans hungry for more, the folks behind Paladins continue to release characters, maps, game modes, and gameplay changes on a near monthly basis. The prices in the shop are all fair, the customization is wonderful, and there is no pay to win. 

No other multiplayer game has kept me coming back again and again for so many years. I can't recommend it enough."
3558,Better than Overwatch lol
3559,Great work with Lilith. She makes me want to come back to Paladins.
3560,most underrated game of the century
3561,Great game
3562,furry con
3563,The game... Is good.
3564,"paladins is pretty good
pros
1: many champions to play and experiment with
2: cool mechanics
3: minor bugs
but there is some problems
cons
1: it might be pretty hard to learn for new players
2: u either have a team of pros or a team of noobs
3: very grindy (even for me)
over all the game is good

8/10"
3565,funne
3566,its good
3567,its a fun game to play while bored
3568,gæm
3569,👍
3570,tiddies
3571,good
3572,"Pretty fun for being free. The many champions and consistent updates are good for the game. It's free, why not try it?"
3573,"It's free. The gameplay is good, and there's a lot of heroes to play as. The wait times can be a bit long, but overall I think this is a very solid F2P hero shooter"
3574,Overwatch has s*x with smite and the baby is Paladins. Its free to play too.
3575,W game
3576,very good game i ate a child
3577,"Great game, I play both Paladins and Overwatch, Paladins is definitely underrated, it's super fun game with a huge hero pool"
3578,"Absolute trash, even worse than Overwatch. I mean It's free but not even worth ur Time. In Every Round/Match the other players are dead inside, nobody is talking or communicating. The game looks awful and had no graphical improvements, the only things they added and still updating are skins for half naked woman. Or New useless agents. 2/10"
3579,Noice
3580,good
3581,yes
3582,Overwatch for Mr. Krab
3583,bootleg overwatch
3584,More fun than overwatch. You can actually customize your characters abilities and other stuff a bit instead of just being stuck with the same characters like in overwatch
3585,"Very good game, well balanced, though has a few bugs that prevent the game from starting/ often crashing. Once that is fixed, then this game would be S tier"
3586,Before it was removed from the store I bought the champions pack on literally every platform because I thought it was funny. With my combined playtime now I don't know if it's so funny anymore but I still love this game.
3587,game wouldn't load at all
3588,"Its a love, hate thing."
3589,its ok its like overwatch
3590,"Best game ever I love it so much it made me fall in love again after all these years, it has way better mechanics than over watch and is way more fun to play. The horses are the best and i love how you can shit on kids until you find a no life that loves this game more than me then it is a shit game that makes me racist.

                                                                                                                                                  The End

3591,"Its like overwatch, but with build diversity, devs add content, unique characters, less toxicity and its free."
3592,:)
3593,yes
3594,budget overwatch but better than overwatch 2
3595,"Overwatch: 20€ gets you  access to all content; nothing but cosmetics and competitive play is locked.
Paladins: Even if you pay 60€, you will not unlock all characters. But greed is not the only problem with paladins.
Many characters have invincibility- and other abilities that allow them to play recklessly without risk.
The good thing about paladins is that it has cross platform progression on all platforms except playstation. Fuck you sony. How dare you keep my magma Makoa hostage.

Dear Evil Mojo: Please buff Yagorath. Her ultimate seems to do nothing half the time, and its wayyyyy too situational and restrictive in both its optimal targets and range. Her damage also seems kinda low considering she cant even move."
3596,"So, I played this game a shit ton back on PS4, but when I switched over to PC I had to see that this game is even more broken on PC. The game itself is fun with a nice cast of champions but all the bugs are just super annoying."
3597,infinite loading screen is fun
3598,"This game is filled with bugs, bad/toxic players, has had odd and seemingly random balance changes across a vast section of it's updates, has made poor management decisions, infuriating matchups, messy casuals, unfair matchmaking, and most of all: has a vicious illness of a seemingly ever dwindling player base that continues to let the game inevitably die, no matter it's previous glory.

Best free game I've ever played I get on it every day and has great potential :) please get on this game."
3599,"overwatch but free version, play since 2017"
3600,its a free really good game
3601,y
3602,"Freaking worst match making ever, when you are playing as beginner and this game just matches you with the 84lvl or 104lvl players with good card rolled enemy - fcking shit i dont like it any more, i wont recommend for the new players"
3603,very fun free gaem
3604,its ok
3605,"good
"
3606,"its Overwatch for Meme lords, strategists, and trolls, with a true MOBA-sized roster, customization list, and following. if you miss the days when Overwatch still had a casual following, play this! My only gripe is that heroes are rotated for free to players, meaning you cant really specialize as anyone."
3607,gud gud
3608,"OK
"
3609,fun with friends
3610,no
3611,cheri
3612,Good game that could use a little love from more people to become a great game
3613,"I guess a bit of fix in the mechanics would make this game more mainstream than ever. Overall, however, this is a game of creative skills. Would recommend."
3614,:)
3615,"Game keeps pumping out new heroes and event passes like there's no tomorrow. Lack of game balance makes the free heroes the game gives you feel like shit against the paid for/ earned heroes. Games have cheaters that have been in matchmaking for weeks now and they still haven't been removed. The game being free may be a point to defending these problems but that doesn't change the fact that the game feels like shit when you get matched with cheaters or just people who bought the better heroes. The free currency you earn in game is practically nothing, if you're a casual player this is even more painful since it'll take you months to get a new hero using the free currency.

TLDR: The game is buggy, lacks balancing and is P2W."
3616,"Trash game, stay dead kid"
3617,It's quite fun
3618,bondage superheroes
3619,oh boy new chaladins papmbion
3620,"Every update makes this game run worse. Love me some Chinese garbage. DPS class is 100% brain off ""monkey push left click"" gameplay. Dookie game, every time they update it it's less fun. Damage characters go ooga booga me Kinesser McGrinkle, me two-shot half the roster. TLDR Ape gameplay + garbage game developed by Orangutans :(((( SAD!"
3621,Wish I could run 64 bit so textures work...fun game with friends tho
3622,Koga go brrrr
3623,yes good game but still hacker issue
3624,"Paladins is a free game. So what do you expect? Well, to be honest, Paladins delivers when it comes to being a free game. Diverse champion selection, tons of play styles, a talent and card system to customize, with in-match items to boot.... There's quite a bit here to assess. 

Here's a few positives: For one, the amount of selection allows room to main not just one character, but find multiple that you consider fun. Every category of Champion has a unique cast, where, chances are, you'll find yourself liking at least one character per category. The skins are cool, with the majority being high-quality with unique voice acting. Not all are the best, but many fit themes really well and the game is starting to shine with crossovers, despite the many years of development before. Old features and maps are being re-done and improved, bringing life to boring situations. There's a bunch of out-of-game customization with a profile and the like, so those willing to spend can further adjust their gameplay. But most of all, there are VERY little P2W features, with the only one being certain skins having harder to see or hear ultimates/abilities. Playing (suffering) with friends is a blast, where you actually feel skilled when winning certain matches. The toxicity isn't too high in matches compared to more popular AAA titles. Most recently, Paladins has been giving more to F2P players, lowering the prices of passes and bringing back ways to get free crystals with only partially tedious tasks. The lag isn't too bad, where most encounters don't end in a machine-shotgun Buck who can't damage anyone or anything. I already mentioned the champion customization, but you can truly make something special with certain characters. Healers can play damage, Tanks can play Flank, and so on. Such benefits alone give Paladins strong ground.

But, as there are positives, there are negatives. There is a surplus of bugs every patch, where the patch notes even contradict what was in the game. Certain talent adjustments don't make it past the PTS for months. Patches aren't very spread apart, however, most bugs end of remaining for over a month or two due to there only being a midpatch per major update. Balance is a constant struggle, and certain champions are blatantly better than others, without much being done to fix those problems. (Aegis Fernando is a great example) While some champions get constant attention with skins and balance like Maeve, others get little to no love at all despite low play rates, such as Moji. (This is why picking multiple mains is important) The devs aren't very open with the community or feedback, as previously stated, specific issues and changes don't happen for a solid while. New champions are always either overpowered or underpowered, without much of a between until around 3 updates later. The servers just decide to die from time to time, where the game will be rendered unplayable for a few days. Crashes are random but common, especially on lower-end PCs. The in-game VGS is mostly used for sarcasm or to spam ""Push the Payload!"" to a 150 health Flank.

Despite so many issues, I still find a ton of fun on Paladins. I genuinely enjoy a large part of the cast and have boatloads of fun with friends. For a free game, I found myself spending more time on it than the majority of AAA games I have played. A must-try for sure, especially if you can invite a friend with you to learn together."
3625,no
3626,"Tirando os milhares de bugs, é um jogo decente"
3627,"never realized i never wrote a review for this game, in the first couple years of this release this game hitboxes were so bad i made it to a top 10 as strix and played agaisnt somebody who told a dev i was cheating and i was banned, this game is shit lol"
3628,"peak
"
3629,"good game
"
3630,"This game is a very inclusive fps, on top of this the champions have their own brilliant play styles.  Some would compare it to Overwatch, and that's understandable, but I feel this game is unique enough."
3631,"fun battle royal, cool abilities with a tank/heals/dps 5 man format. sweet game modes and no need to pay to advance. the thing that sets it aside from other similar game is the fps style. not a fan of the whole top down dealio"
3632,"Great game, easy to pick up and play. however it has countless bugs.. but truly, it's what makes paladins paladins. Community when playing ranked can be toxic asf, but what game isnt these days.

Overall a fun game"
3633,h
3634," has some dynamic phisics wacky and weird
"
3635,Better than Overwatch and Overwatch 2
3636,very nice game been playing it since i had a xbox one had a 1000 hours on there and nearly a 100 on pc only complaint is they need to buff the older champs all the new ones are to strong.
3637,
3638,nice
3639,"This game sucks ass, why am I still playing it"
3640,"I enjoy the game, its fun. But there is problems loading into the game and the graphics are patchy. Overall tho its a fun game."
3641,"I like the game, It has problems but my over all feel for the game is good. 

I definitely think if you have friends to play with you'll be better off."
3642,"Having played this game for over 4 years now, my conclusion is that Paladins is the best game ever with the smartest developers you can find."
3643,If you're lucky you will see 2 or 3 bugs per hour but for me It was like 7 or 8 bugs which won't let me play and of course balance doesn't exist
3644,id like to review this game but it would be biased and bad
3645,So mucuh fun and very easy getting into. Currently only have 100 hours but I can already achieve a high spot in ranked.
3646,"Had a bug where the game forced me to change my username and then CS told me I had to pay for them to do their jobs and fix it. Then the new champ is locked despite me having purchased an all champion pack. CS also ignores some support requests entirely for whatever reason and when they do respond, they take several days to do so. Loved this game but the customer support is absolutely awful, if ur support ticket is responded to by Ria, ask for another rep. They either don't know how to read or don't want to do their job.
Update: It's now been over a month and I have sent another email. They're most certainly ignoring me, how mature lmao
Final update: I have sent 2 more emails and both were ignored. Imagine working in customer service and being pressed that someone asked you to do your job. I've long since uninstalled and my friends with 500-1000+ hours are leaving as well. I suggest others to do the same or not play at all to begin with."
3647,>Overwatch
3648,"Don't waste your time. There were a few seasons where it was fun but it has completely gone to shit. 
The devs have no idea how to balance the heroes, quickplay has become an utter joke with most people playing every mode like deathmatch and ranked is so toxic, you should get paid to participate.

3667,"so many bugs and problems, fun when it works but quite irrating. Also ranked in AUS servers is almost non exsistent"
3668,"Paladins is a Multiplayer Online Class Based FPS centered around team strategy and item management. Coming out near the time of Overwatch’s release detremented Paladins immensely for its primary years. However, ever since the decline of Overwatch updates in and around late 2019 to early 2020, I’ve been opting to play Paladins instead more often than not. The characters are engaging and unique, each having specific gameplay functions and skills to use against foes. The online modes are mostly fun, yet Siege, the “main” gamemode, falls a little flat and has become boring and repetitive over my time playing the game. Team Deathmatch and Onslaught really highlight the main selling points of this game. Less focused on team play and more focused on individual skill, these modes are the most fun and make me feel less forced into the stereotypical tank and healer roles I normally play."
3669,yes
3670,loved the game from the start

3689,love the game just not a fame of the fact that its throws me in games with super sweats
3690,I enjoy this game a lot but sadly hi-rez does not work on this game all they do to this game is add champions and make small minor changes to champs they never nerf things that are broken like for one the worst thing about this game is that cauterize exists. and now its worst than before at first cauterize isnt bad because its only 25% but by half the game its at 90% reduced healing like???? what is that even what is the point in having a healer that does 90% reduced healing litteratly any damage or flank or even tank can kill a champion with a healer sitting on top of them its ridiculous this game has so much potential to be better than similiar competitive games like overwatch especially i enjoy overwatch as well but the only things that make me enjoy overwatch 100% more are the fact that cauterize isnt a thing and overwatch has role queing which is amazing because there a many trolls in paladins that just auto lock the champ they want to play which ruins the game for many other people i wouldnt mind waiting a little bit longer for a game just for everyone to be able to play the role they want to play i can understand why they dont want to add role queing if they even think about it because of things like how it makes it where u can have 2 tanks 1 support 1 damage and a flank or 1 tank 2 support 1 damage and a flank etc etc... but i find that its much more annoying that people will just instantly choose who they want and say fuck you to everyone else and it just ruins the games experience this game has a lot of potentional and this is just my bit im sure there are people that arent thinking like me and thats okay all opinions but i think we can all agree hi-rez needs to stop putting so many champions in the game and actually make the game better. which is why they stopped esports but it doesnt seem like that was the reason because they aint dont shit.

3700,"The community is absolutely toxic and very basic sheep mentality.  IF you dare pick out of their own perceived meta of champions you will likely get mass reported and banned and lose any money invested because these kids all embrace pack mentality, if you are not holding the pitchfork, you are getting picthforked kinda mentality.  

I just got 4 reports for asking a Raum to buy items.  He said ""your mom buys items"", everyone laughed, then he said ""report this toxic kid"" and of course, the pack complies.  You might think being silent will help, but they will then just say you are not communicating enough and again, reports...its a trainwreck."

3717,"I love this game. I play it a lot. However, there is a lot about the game that puts a terrible taste in my mouth. I know I probably shouldn't be printing out pictures of Maeve and eating them, but they do taste terrible. On top of that, I have other issues.

- ""Give Us Your Money!"" - In this game, it'll cost you around $8 to open a chest. Fine, it's a free to play game, you can have microtransactions, but consider this: That $8 gets you enough gems for one cool chest (+ a little extra gems). That one chest could have like a 1 in 193 chance or something like that to get the skin you want. You don't get it, so you buy another. $16. If you are a whale, you could throw in another 8. Adds up to $24. This stacks up incredibly fast, you likely nexer get what you want, and you just sit there, sad, with skins for characters you don't use. The battlepass? $15. The things on the battlepass aren't even worth $15 in my opinion. It's extremely underwhelming, only has 30 levels, most of the content is stickers and boosters, and the amount of gems, the one thing you should be excited to finally get, is microscopic. This game has a worse case of shameless money hungry whale-targeting than Genshin Impact.

- Bugs - This game has an amount of bugs that shouldn't even exist. We've reported them for years, and it feels like nothing is done about them. While I personally have gotten pretty lucky, my friend has struggled with the bugs a lot, and after looking at what other players have to say about them, they seem very common. The bug I hate the most, while it is pretty small, is the fact that notifications are busted. After every match, I don't get notified of how much I earned that game, I get told how much I earned for the entirety of my play session. Or, when I level up on the battlepass, I get notified not only for what I have received (rare because I am free to play), I get notified for every previous tier as well, EVEN THOUGH I DO NOT HAVE THE BATTLEPASS.

- Dev Support - Support for this game seems nonexistent. We get updates, but as I stated before, bugs are often going unfixed, support tickets are ignored, and all in all, the game feels like a husk with no heart poured into it. I love the characters, the skins look great, I'm excited for the next Siege: Beyond, because it genuinely looks cool, but the fact that the devs don't seem to care about problems the playerbase has really taints the game for me. Just some interaction with the playerbase, some communication, some transparency, realness, ANYTHING, would make me feel better about the game. Do something about cheaters. Stop scamming us with absurd prices. Fix the bugs. GIVE ME MY HORSE THAT I AM SUPPOSED TO GET FOR LINKING MY YOUTUBE AND SUBSCRIBING TO YOU? Just do something. Make this game better for us all.

In summary, this game is amazing. I love it and play it every day with at least one of my friends. I have plagued my group with it, and practically begged them to play it with me, and we've had a lot of fun since. I just feel that the game is in the wrong hands. Being free to play seems to also hurt it quite a bit. I mean the in-app purchases are wildly unfair. I want to enjoy this game and be proud of playing it. I would spend SOOO much money on it if I felt like the developers were people I wanted to support. The game is great. Love it. The devs don't make me feel valued as a player. For the same reason I despise a certain mobile gacha game, it's hard for me to recommend this game to others. Hopefully things turn around soon. Excited for Lillith, peace."

3719,"Paladins is one of my go-to games. They say that this is an easy game, but for me? if you are not on shooting games, you need time to practice playing it until you enjoy it. I am not a great player but i could say that i could really play  the objectives of this game."

So,guys who want kind of soft porn,boob & ass etc,then you can try it.Also,most importantly if you're looking for Overwatch type game but FREE version,then try this.

Only reason of mine disliking this game,that is vulgar content."

3728,overwatch but free

3732,"The game is ok, i guess, I play it rather than OW, but it being a buggy mess is unfortunate, still worth playing. 
Unpolished in some(most) aspects but very fun, it really is.
There is an alternate universe where this game was made by Blizzard and I want to go to that world"
3733,Use to be good but full of hackers and everyone else is so delusional they convince themselves they're just better so they don't bother reporting (there isn't even a report option for hacking and you have to report after the game is over). Don't waste your time.

3748,report seris
3749,fun game
3750,"Forced me to run it in 32bit, DX9 for it to launch at all, (this problem has been known for a long time, never fixed). 
Anyone on higher tier and newer specs will not be able to utilize their performance because of this. 
Issues like this are also completely ignored by the developers, as battlepasses, skins, and new characters are what make them money, they have settled for the small amount of people that complain about this like me. As it doesn't do much harm to their profits. 

  What people might like:
If your aim isn't the greatest and you aren't as competitive as other FPS players, Paladins may still be good for you due to MASSIVE hit boxes and easy to aim abilities.

Characters are released pretty quickly.

The game is colorful (yet kinda dull looking at the same time) <- con or pro idk

3751,"I wanted to make it long at first, but to hell with it. It's going to be short.

Recommended to play? Yeah, I think so. It's unique and can be fun.

Recommended to commit to and spend money on? Hell no. Besides the smallest or second smallest (out of 3 in total) champion packs, and even those are not mandatory. The thing is, their actions just ensure that you're going to regret most purchases you might've done. You can say they even discourage commitment and spending money on it in the long run. So, just have fun and play it before it's shut down due to mismanagement."

3778,Instead of actually balancing healers they throw a stacking antiheal debuff as the game goes along at 6 minutes 90% antiheal for everyone what a dumb fucking decision

3781,It is very fun and it is basically better overwatch but free
3782,Overwatch for broke people so me
3783,"It is like overwatch like so many say. In the worst ways lol.
 Money grab , buggy as hell , ugly. It is overwatch if they had one good idea (card system) and 16$ to work with. 
Cheaters in this game are almost as common as normal players  , and if you can find the ""normal"" players they are on there 8th alt account because they got too high in ranked and were getting there shit kicked in. 

Overall, Fun game if your willing to look over ... everything? Play with friends , thats my advice, any shit game can be made fun with friends :))"
3784,"Its an OK game. Game devs dont do much with it these days as Hirez (parent company) focuses all their resources and money on Smite (their favorite child). Tons of bugs, dodgy match making, and lack of support all make for an interesting game play experience. They need to rebuild this entire game from the ground up if theres any hope of this game surviving. But hey, at least they keep adding cash shop items to keep it on life support a little longer!"

3791,Fun game to play with friends
3792,"This game is too fun, I can't stop playingggggggggggggggggggggggg."
3793,"Great game, with constant updates/new champs/balance patches. HOWEVER. It has rampant toxicity, cheaters even in casual modes, horrible matchmaking (new installs vs best players in the game. happened to me several times.), and tons of game-breaking bugs. When you don't take into account all the things I just mentioned or aren't affected by them much, 9/10. If you are affected by any of these negatives, though, it can quickly become a 5/10. Not consistent enough to be a competitive game, but it is one of my favorite casual games. Hopefully HiRez take their noses out of the dirt and fix some of these issues sometime soon. In the meantime, your quality of experience is going to be kinda a dice roll."

3797,"A better experience than Overwatch! Its not the most graphical game but the abilities and mechanics keep it interesting. If you thought having a dragon or going completely invisible was needed, then this is the game. With each role actually serving a purpose. And there are plenty of ridiculous and hilarious moments."

3869,"This game is very fun. The fact that it's free is surprising to me because of how amazing it is. You get to pick a champion and each champion has different abilities, weapons, and skins. It's such a good game."
3870,"There is some sort of bug that after years of playing has never been addressed and nobody online seems to have a fix. You will have frame drops every few seconds. Makes teamfights impossible and aiming even harder. Not my computer since I can run every other game I've played on high-max settings with no problem and this game is built like shit. Dropped the settings down to medium to see if it helped, nope, and at medium the textures look like they don't even load in at all. If it didn't have this problem that makes it literally unplayable I'd play more. I come back every 6 months or so to see if it's been addressed but so far nothing.

Would not recommend wasting the storage space."

But yeah if it works for you the other issues are weak gunplay and poor graphics (I mean SMITE looks a little better). Otherwise it's a fair replacement for Overwatch and the like."

3902,"Good Game, nice skins and battle pass progression. They just need to update it from Unreal Engine 3 to Unreal Engine 4 or 5 is all to make it better."
3903,toxic community
3904,"I know what you are thinking - isn't this just Overwatch, but ordered from Wish? And yes, you'd be right. But sometimes you actually find a pretty good deal that meets your needs, even if it is rough around the edges.

Paladins has a lot going for it - easy to learn; diverse characters with unique abilities; low tech requirements; and post-game trash talk all at the low price of nothing. As a casual MOBA FPS, it hits the right notes more often than not

Standard F2P model, with in-game currency allowing you to access more characters and some skins. Sadly it's pretty clear that most of the development time is goes towards cosmetics and skins. But that is just Hi-Rez following the trends, like if a Mad-Catz controller became its own publisher. 

The game itself hasn't really evolved much, despite a consistent stream of new characters. Adding more doesn't help the game if you are also not addressing existing balancing or matchmaking concerns.

The loadout system is quite unique and allows for interesting alternative playstyles for each character, but the item system needs a serious rework. Beginners, turn-off autobuy immediately and just read a quick community guide instead for item and loadout builds. It will save you a lot of frustration and grief.

Overall, I think it is good game to play if you are searching for decent MOBA experience. It's fun, and that's all you can hope for really. But given the declining player base, if you'd rather just keep playing TF2, SMITE, or literally any other MOBA, no one would blame you."
3905,"Its a very fun game to play, especially with friends"
3906,High quality free shooter from a smaller studio. They really outdid themselves here and the game has had consistent updates for years. 10/10 absolutely would pay 20 dollars for this game
3907,"It's fun. It feels like most other perk based battle games, the card system is interesting. Worth a play for sure as it is free."
3908,kinda a fun game ngl

3930,"This is my review of the game. Copyright goes to me.

While I was HEAVILY steered away from trying out this game by friends, I went ahead and did so anyway. I am an AVID Over Watch player with over hundreds of hours, Mainly focusing on Support. I always heard ""Paladins is an Over Watch Ripoff"" and, to be fair, I believed it from what I've seen up to the point before I played the game. I first played the game in 2020 on my Xbox, I quickly stopped playing and didn't touch it again. Now fast forward to 2022, I decided to try the game again and installed it on my computer. Now before I start talking about my experience with the game, let me quickly say why I chose to play the game. Now I don't want to be that ""guy"" who constantly compares this game with another, but that's how I was familiar with this game. I was very tired and worn out ""not to mention bored"", of playing Over Watch. No new content, no maps, dwindling community, and toxicity. I know very well that a lot of people feel the same way about this game, but to me, this is fresh. The amount of playable characters this game has is OBNOXIOUS. And I LOVE it. It can be very intimidating and confusing to start, but with the help of YouTube videos (shout out to FrostFangs for being my favorite so far, along with PGG"", I learned a lot about the champions and their abilities. I was so excited about learning about new champions, what they did, how to do it, when to execute it, how to counter specific champions, and when to run away like crazy. And I love how the game is fun and the developers put fun/weird things in the game. The story is interesting so far, and I like how with the release of a new Champion, they expand on it. I can go ON AND ON about this, but let me wrap this up. While I will always love and play Over Watch. this is an exciting new game and adventure for me. I am not one of those people who nit-pick at things from games, I like to play and enjoy the game, and this brought everything I have been seeking in a game. I apologize if I was all over the place, but the conclusion is... THIS GAME IS FUN. Thanks for anyone who ever reads this :D (Also, why would you read all of this? Loser).

With Peace and Love,
Smug Korra"

3941,"Haven't found an obvious cheater yet.
I can queue without preselecting roles.
More important, I can queue and actually find matches.

What an insane concept.

The only thing I would wish for, would be slightly adjusted gamemodes, mainly to make them take longer. Most matches are over in less than 10 minutes."
3942,I love how the game is made and all of the animations and voices and skins that are in the game and i like how they keep the game updated all the time
3943,"Not flawless, but great game. 

Found it in 2018 on Xbox with my friend, loved it since the first game. Addicting and frustrating at times, but can be really buggy and flawed. Paladins really has brought a lot of laughs and good times alone and with friends, really love this game."

4050,basically overwatch for free lmao
4051,"unlocking characters is basically two options: play for 2 hours and you might be able to afford one or spend money. for a free game having a ranked system that requires you to grind to get 15 characters is an interesting aspect. i'd say that saving grace of this game is its amazing cosmetics but even if you decide to shell out a few bucks for some chests be prepared to get items for a character that you have yet to unlock. overall it is not that surprising that this game has stayed as under the radar as it has, with the current way it is set up the devs would be better off just making a game that costs $60 rather than adding all this pay to play anything other than the first 5 ppl they give you"

I've encountered a lot of bugs, which were including bugs with character not being loaded to the screen, interface freezing at settings screen and you can't leave it, not loading to the map, not able to close the game without alt+f4, LMB and RMB doesn't work, music repeating endlessly from character skin after you've changed it.

4067,"Finally, a different Overwatch version without liberals"
4068,"the game is extremely unbalanced, no skill based matchmaking so if you're new then get fucked, the devs don't care about casual players, they only care about the whales and how much money they bring. tried to give this game more time but it's seriously so dog shit i might just go buy overwatch.
oh i also love the ""earn rewards by watching a video"", makes me not want to support the developers because they're so greedy and open about it. seems the remaining player base loves to be manipulated and scammed because they continue to do it.
I seriously hope another better, smarter dev takes this over and changes the direction because the dev team is lost, don't know how to do their job and straight up sucking the money out of players before an inevitable shut down of the game because no one plays it but newcomers who have yet to leave and the dumb ass whales supporting the dev teams antics.

wait, y'all actually flaunt awards from back when your game was good? that's so sad, you can't even make the awards again i'm guessing so those awards shown are just to make y'all feel good about a game you have all ran into the ground. i am thoroughly surprised at how a company has ruined such a decent game. it had a relatively strong playerbase too, not large but consistent enough."

4133,"I would recommend this game as a free alternative to Overwatch, but the game just refuses to launch.

For some reason, the game now immediately CTDs after EAC boots up. No error message, no indication that anything is wrong, it just straight up refuses to launch the actual game and crashes to my desktop. Validating my files didn't help, reinstalling didn't help.

Normally I'd review the game on its merits, but the fact that this bug even exists is enough for me to recommend against this game.

No matter how good the game is, no matter how much time you can spend on it, if the game has an issue where it can randomly stop people from actually playing should never be recommended."

4182,"The little brother to Team Fortress 2.

The poor man’s Overwatch.

Paladins is certainly a lesser version of its more competitive and skill based counterparts.  But it is certainly unique and enjoyable as a hero shooter.

In 2022 the game is already old news.  But if your region still has an active playerbase, give it a try if you’re on the fence.

I’ve been playing since day zero.  Twitchcon 2015 in San Diego, where Paladins had its own booth.  I remember playing as the original Barik.  Who could snipe enemies from across the map with his blunderbuss.

The game modes have shifted greatly over Paladin’s lifespan.  And some heroes have received massive overhauls.

My favorite role, tanks, seem to be in a poor state.  Unable to create space because many of them are non-threatening with severely diminished abilities, no presence, and lackluster damage output.

I still go back once every couple of years to play in Masters and see if anyone I knew is still around.  But the game does get old since matchmaking can be a painful 15-20 minute wait during peak hours and non-existent outside of that."

4199,"Rating: 9/10

The game is a tactical hero shooter, there are more than 40 champions which you play on different maps in mostly a 5v5 mode with mostly two Tanks, one Damage Dealer, one Flank and one support. This may sound similar to Overwatch, but as someone who has >1000 hours in both games I can guarantee you it feels totally different, but why is that?

Paladins lets you customize your champions extremly much, not only through skins, each champion has 3 talents which change the way you play the champion. As an example you can have a look at Io. One of the talents Io has allows the champion to not only heal with one of her abilites, now her placable Fox Luna heals allies in a certain radius.
Furthermore there are card who you can use to create different loadouts for each champion. Those loadouts change the playstile extremly much. For example with the right loadout you can play a Support like Jenos like a Damage Dealer.

Recent issues with the game were mostly the developers, who appearently did not care about the game and forgot to fix bugs and laggs. This has changed recently though. Paladins recieved tons of new content  recently, for example map reworks and new heroes, who are really fun to play."

4208,Good game but i think it gets really repetitive not many maps and dont even get me started about the skilled based matchmaking.....it....it scares me but it is a good game its free overwatch and the free-ness is definitely there but good game i would give it a thumbs in the middle and it is only fun when you are absolutely dominating

4218,"I love hero shooters, and I think that Paladins does a great job at making interesting heroes that are fun to play. You can build your deck to use talents in interesting ways, offering a ton of variety in party composition and gameplay. I'm not sure what is ""meta"" right now in the competitive environment, but casual play seems like every match is unique and keeps me engaged."

4220,"ok, listen... i know i have like 6 hours at the time of making this damn thing but, i used to play this on my xbox through 2018 and 2019 maybe even 2017, idk and i had countless hours but i also played Overwatch and so I am happy to say this is well yes a ripoff but a good one indeed. Its a nice team game and has some amazing champions. but I'd rather play Overwatch for many other reasons that I dont feel like typing but I'll give an example. When you go to the store to buy a PC are you going to buy the cheapest one but it has many problems or... are you going to buy the most expensive one that has the best specs. also pretend you have money like that if you dont. so thats like this game but still its a good game and I reccomend it even a little more to my friends with a low wallet to get this game over Overwatch somtimes but if you got the money its OW"

4239,"A money pit designed to be a money pit. It's extremely difficult to gain money in game without purchasing it with real money, and it becomes a grind otherwise. Just to CHANGE YOUR NAME, you need to grind out 400 gems. You get 25 if you log on every day for a week. That means you need to log on every day for FOUR MONTHS, just to change your name. Or, you could pay 15 dollars to get that amount of gems. My friend set my profile name to his gamertag because my steam account was logged into his computer, he wanted to try out paladins, and didnt realize he wasnt on his own steam account. My name is permanently now ""meowmeowkibble"" and I have no way of changing it for the next three months or so (Yes, you can laugh at me, it's pretty damn funny tbh). I'm not even getting into the thirst traps in this game, either. The gameplay is fun, but the practices are so scummy that it isnt worth it if you arent already into the gameplay. Don't get this game."

Each champion has its own abilities and play styles to choose from. There are different modes of play and you can support the developers by purchasing cosmetics for your favorite champions. You can also purchase new champions with the gold earned from playing which is nice. Or, you can spend real money and not have to grind for them."

4312,"Okay, before this stupid patch I thought Cauterizer was horrible. NOW EVERYONE HAS AN IN-BUILT CAUTERIZER LMAO and its effects increase just through the passage of time in-game. No reason to have healers on your team when it's like this. Just go full damage and flank and whatever because the whole game's a huge team deathmatch mode now. Whose idea was this? At least the removal of boots made kinda sense in Smite but turning something awful into THIS? WHY???"

This is the degenerate version of Overwatch still kinda fun though."

4320,Worst teammates of every game ever but everything else is enjoyable.
4321,amazing game just the abilities and their working is a bit confusing at start but as you play more you get a hang of it. The only problem for me is that they dont have a asia server and i have to play on high latence.

4341,When my mom tells me we have Overwatch at home:
4342,yes
4343,cringe
4344,גשג
4345,I came back because of a certain Vtuber
4346,I enjoyed this a lot more than Overwatch. Lots of characters to play with. Game runs really well.
4347,very fun game with friends
4348,pretty nice budget alternative to overwatch. everyone's aim sucks here tho
4349,This game made me gay
4350,"Let me start by saying that I am quite an hardcore, competitive player and that my review is mostly directed to players wanting to play Ranked. Other than on Steam, I have also played Paladins for more than two years on Xbox One (1600+ hours) and Nintendo Switch. I achieved the highest rank in the game multiple times during Season 4 (Peaked in Top 20 Grandmaster players on EU server, playing Support/Flex) so you can say I quite comprehend the competitive nature of the game.

As of right now, the game is in one of the worst states it has ever been, and it will never change.
There are absolutely 0 reason to starting playing the game in 2022 as it will just continue to get buggier and worse every patch, as it has been for the last 3 years.
I will now go in depth on why I think this, if you have never played Paladins and were thinking about making it your main competitive game, dont do it, its actual garbage.

Good things about Paladins:
-The core gameplay design is unique and objectively functional, at least in theory.
-It is quite easy to run even on budget PCs...

Bad things about Paladins:
-...but it is also incredibly bad optimized with (at least in my case) low GPU and CPU usage and unstable frame rate all around. (I have a Ryzen 5 3500x and a RX 580, Overwatch runs WAY better with also better graphics)
-Servers are garbage. They have always been like this and HiRez doesnt give a fuck about it. Servers often randomly crash and not even the Ping counter works. There are times where playing very mobile champions become a nightmare thanks to incredible delay some matches have.
-The champion balance team clearly doesnt know how the game works.
-Blatant cheaters take literal MONTHS to get banned and more soft aimbotters or wallhackers will never get caught unless some people snitch on them, the anticheat doesnt exist at all.
-Leavers and toxic players are everywhere.
-The monetization system is bad (Chests are pricey gacha and in general skins can cost quite a lot to get)
-The matchmaking feels like its random (both in casual and ranked), Golds get sorted in Grandmaster lobbies and you can often see completely new players in the same match as world champions.
-Lots of the new champions and skins are non other than overly sexualised women with even some soft-porn voicelines.
(For instance, they took a furry character from the game and created a genderbent and incredibly sexualised version of it, which you were forced to see as a ""Enemy Death Card"" cosmetic every time you died, wtf).
-Public figures representing the game are often in scandals.
-Bugs, the game is bugged, the code is spaghetti, every new patch bugs keep getting worse and worse (with even some game breaking ones being in the game for literal months)
-The Ranked system is actually infuriating: other than the RNG matchmaking, you can easily cheat your way up to the highest ranks and NEVER being banned, and im not joking. The servers have 0 DDOS protection, so you can literally crash the matches you are losing using just a shitty IP stresser you can find online for free, and so achieving any rank with only a very small probability of getting banned. This is what the community calls ""drophack"" and will NEVER be fixed, its 6 years it is in the game and Hirez never even tries to do anything anymore. My literal $10 minecraft server has better DDOS protection if anyone was interested.
-There are times my game randomly crashes or cant even be opened, resulting in an EasyAnticheat error. Its been years it is like that and even after changing PC it keep happening.

Dont play this garbage, dont support the greedy corporation that destroyed this game trying to monetize more. The game will never get better."
4351,good

4377,"Most of the time you get queued with people actively eating paste mid match. it's a 2/5 experience that I keep coming back to, only to be disappointed again. I want to like this game but there's no balancing and the modes feel bad. I wish blizzard didn't shit the bed so I could be on actual overwatch."
4378,good free game
4379,"Much more than just an overwatch clone, I like it MORE than overwatch in fact. The rounds are fast and usually never last longer than 10-15 min so if you're ever getting stomped by a team its never for long :) plus the game is free"

4394,it good (very fun) not stinky overwatch + free
4395,verga paladins tremendo juego tan cachuo papi que molleja de verga tan buena
4396,"be careful where you step, otherwise you might spend money on this ""free to play"" game... fun game mechanics but economy is suuuper pay to play. play at your own risk!!"

4414,Had fun playing in theory but it's nearly impossible to play a single game without an afker right from the beginning. You'll get more active gameplay from the bots. The community completely ruins this game.

4423,"EXTREMELY TOXIC COMMUNITY

This is a great game to play and progress in with a group of friends, but if you're interested in playing solo, just don't.

The randoms are toxic. The language is toxic. The community is toxic.

Someone thinks you're playing bad or just doesn't like you? They'll cuss you out and then sit afk for the rest of the game making sure your team loses. And this wouldn't be a terrible thing if it wasn't for the fact that the Devs have done NOTHING to combat it. You can report players all you want, you'll see them in your matches tomorrow and the next day. This game has so much potential but it is stricken down by the fact that it collects so much garbage in its player-base because the Devs have allowed it to be so.

Devs, do something about it. It is the most major thing killing this game. Stop releasing new content when the content isn't the problem. FIX. YOUR. COMMUNITY."
4424,Its good
4425,Better than overwatch. Coming from a 2000 hour overwatch player.

4447,is cool
4448,"While I was HEAVILY steered away from trying out this game by friends, I went ahead and did so anyway. I am an AVID Overwatch player with over hundreds of hours, Mainly focusing on Support. I always heard ""Paladins is an Overwatch Ripoff"" and, to be fair, I believed it from what I've seen up to the point before I played the game. I first played the game in 2020 on my Xbox, I quickly stopped playing and didn't touch it again. Now fast forward to 2022, I decided to try the game again and installed it on my computer. Now before I start talking about my experience with the game, let me quickly say why I chose to play the game. Now I don't want to be that ""guy"" who constantly compares this game with another, but that's how I was familiar with this game. I was very tired and worn out  ""not to mention bored"", of playing Overwatch. No new content, no maps, dwindling community, and toxicity. I know very well that a lot of people feel the same way about this game, but to me, this is fresh. The amount of playable characters this game has is OBNOXIOUS. And I LOVE it. It can be very intimidating and confusing to start, but with the help of Youtube videos (shout out to FrostFangs for being my favorite so far, along with PGG"", I learned a lot about the champions and their abilities. I was so excited about learning about new champions, what they did, how to do it, when to execute it, how to counter specific champions, and when to run away like crazy. And I love how the game is fun and the developers put fun/weird things in the game. The story is interesting so far, and I like how with the release of a new Champion, they expand on it. I can go ON AND ON about this, but let me wrap this up. While I will always love and play Overwatch. this is an exciting new game and adventure for me. I am not one of those people who knick-pick at things from games, I like to play and enjoy the game, and this brought everything I have been seeking in a game. I apologize if I was all over the place, but the conclusion is... THIS GAME IS FUN. Thanks for anyone who ever reads this :D (also why would you read all of this? loser)

With Peace and Love,
Draguns."

You have cards to customize your hero, and items on top of the character abilities.

This makes this game the superior one. Tons of customization, more characters, varied gamemode and maps.

The game runs extremely well on my aging GPU, on max settings 1080p 60fps.

After not playing since February 2022 and then trying to log in on April 2022, turns out my account was banned/suspended (support team cannot make up their mind about the status of my account) on a time period where I didn't even play the game with no reason given about why, since ""they reserve the right to not mention why accounts were banned"".

There are better shooters out there, don't support Hi-Rez in any way and go do your business somewhere else."

4584,"It was fun when it first launched, but as soon as it started to succeed the creators add microtransactions, overpriced skins and impossible to complete quests, now the game is full of bugs, and sometimes unplayable due to those bugs. When I can actually play the game, I cant be one second without having a booty on my screen."
4585,Was forced into playing it. It's fine tbh.
4586,"This may be the worst game I have played in 12 years

If you are looking for a team based shooter, forget that this title exists. 

I have never seen a game in my entire life, that punishes players who pick support characters.
How come that they include an ""anti-healing"" mechanic? Before the game even starts, I already have 30% anti-healing and it goes up by time, I do less and less healing it is just frustrating.

My team is not able to contest the objective if my anti-healing reached 90% by the end of the game? Ying's illusions do 8 healing in the late game, 8 healing?! What am I supposed to do with that? It doesnt heal anyone, it keeps my colleagues on life support! I bet in 2 years, they'll put the anti-healing limit to 120%, where my pure presence in the game causes harm to my team.

>You think you can turn the match around by just getting good at this game? Absolutely not, because the more you play the less you heal and that's not even the worst part of that ""game"".

>There are champions which are completely overpowered, That snake-dragon thing, that rolls like a Droideka
has what? 5000 - 6000 health points and is able to cover the entire are close to the objective in fire? Good luck competing against that. Because I am 100% sure, that it takes reduced damage, like the other tanks. 
Don't even bother to fight it with your team, because you wont receive healing anyway.

>Champs are overpowered? Well, either that or they are completely useless like Furia. What am I supposed to do with a gun, that deals 120 damage? Even the bots in the game will laugh at you. Of course Ying, another support hero deals 500 damage. Seems logical.

>Next annoying aspect is, that they have the worst menu sound design. Everytime I switch menu a different music starts playing. Oh nice, yes I would like to listen to Monstercat everytime I select anything except the title screen.

>Don't even get me started on the skins...

Play Team Fortress 2 or Overwatch, basically anything else has better optimized mechanics than this.

Edit: Teammates are not capable of buying items

Might aswell install Battleborn again."

4589,"the game is great and very enjoying but there is a big issue 

servers are terrible and too buggy"
4590,"Value brand hero shooter trash. Broken mechanics that never get adjusted or patched, terrible characters that get churned out every 1-2 months that have less and less effort and care put into them, non-existent mod staff and non-existent customer service for the umpteen times their rickety systems bug out. No characters have any coherent lore or likeable personalities, the art style and artistic choices made for characters, skins and mounts are weird and don't make any sense...I could go on forever. TLDR: empty, buggy shell of a hero shooter"

4594,"Now, I'm writing this right before I unlock competitive, But I want to just give my review from my 100 hours on casual. 

I feel like this game gets a lot of hate it doesn't deserve. The devs put a lot of hard work into the characters, and it shows. In my time of playing from when I first got it on steam, 2 characters have been released and A third is releasing next Thursday. It's not a lack of development, and It's not bad choices. I have never malded due to pay to win, or seen it at all, and some metas just exist. 

The community, atleast in casual, is great. Usually they're willing to communicate, and the quick chat works great for quick situations and getting people's attention. I've met one toxic person, and they were just having a really bad day (Ended up going 0/7 when everyone else had a kill xd)

I get bored of games quick, but this game keeps having stuff to have come back to. New decks, new champions, new metas, new duo strategies(Play this game with a friend!!!). I'm unable to reminisce about the good old days of paladins, but I can certainly say that this is my favorite game so far in 2022."
4595,"free overwatch with more gamemodes, characters, skins, and better balancing."
4596,lots of guns
4597,"Very good
"
4598,"Paladins is probably the most broken online game I've seen in my entire life...
...but, somehow, it has so much more ""soul"" than them polished AAA projects and everything. 
I don't understand it but this game has this charm that you sometimes wanna go back to.
But holy hell it's broken.

4604,downloaded it earlier today after a long time. started a match up. froze after charactor selection. closed game. opened back up. tried to put me into the match. failed. went to homescreen. couldnt click on anything. closed the game. opened it up and repeat. been trying now for last hour and it keeps trying to put me into a game that would have finished a long time ago. fails. then sends me to homepage in which i cant click on anything. fucking annoying.

4612,good
4613,this game was fun until i learned about recoil and how this game had none of that.
4614,"This game used to be great! but the devs are slowly trying to weed out everything that made the game fun and unique to fit the broadest demographic possible. They are over saturating the game with champions and refusing to fix the ones that are over powered and broken.

Let's talk about anti heal! The anti heal system that was implemented last year i feel worked rather well, with the price of the card lowered along with the amount of anti heal that is dealt. It was a must have card and was sort of, built into the the game meta but you did not always need it. However, the recent changes have left the anti heal ability to be passive throughout the match for everybody to intentionally make matches artificially shorter. Matches before could go from anywhere between 10-20 minuets but now matches go from 5-10 minuets. 

The game has turned into an absolute spam fest with most of the new champions having obscenely powerful abilities with very few ways to counter them. This game is a mess now and the devs are to blame. 

I honestly cannot recommend the game in it's current state. This is the first time i have uninstalled it from my computer since starting two years ago. If the devs truly care about the game, they will address the issues at hand instead of adding fat, politically correct characters that are awful to look at and fight against."

4670,"fun, but if you have the money i'd say you should just buy Overwatch."
4671,( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)
4672,"goodgame
"
4673,"Fun game with fun champions. All the classes are fun to play including healers and tanks. Unfortunately there is a very low playerbase and they also made cauterize (antiheal item) literally into a game mechanic that ramps up so there is 90% antiheal on hit late game. It is also a little (a lot) buggy. But those are the main problems, the game is really fun and has lots of movement in it and you can fly across the map as some champions. You will find a champion you enjoy and not all of them need good aim to play. Community not as toxic as LoL for example. Everyone is a n00b until Diamond, when you will start to meet the same tryhards every game since the player base is so small. The devs still care about the game as well and new champions are still fun and unique. Highly recommend."
4674,yes
4675,I would honestly just grind the levels in this game for the fun of it :D
4676,I wish my friends would play this more often

4682,"Paladin is honetly such a great game. Its very similar to overwatc and when i mean similar, its cuz its basically the same game modes. But dont you dare call this game a ''copy'' of overwatch cuz its not, Paladin does certain things better than overwatch and has some different and cooler mechanics. Thats the good part of Paladin.
Now the bad:
The developpers seem like they dont give 2 shits about the game being polished. Its a good game yes, but it has so many bugs and game breaking glitches that it becomes so annoying. And what do they do about it you may ask me? 
Literally, NOTHING.
instead of fixing the game, they focuse on releasing new characters and cosmetics and the pass (basically the Battle pass). I mostly play on a PS5 and the game chrashes sometimes but freezes SO MANY TIMES, and you have to reset the game. 
Also, i play terminus, and his leep attack will sometimes get stuck and im stuck in the air without being able to do anything nut rotate on myself.

So in the end... if you plan to play this game: Its very good and a lot of fun alone or with friends,
It has a bunch of interesting characters and you will find one you like for sure
And so many cool cosmetics, but they are expensive af

BUT
You will most definitely encounter bugs, glitches and game breaking characters like skye
whatever you do... DO NOT PLAY SKYE
shes way to op and shes just a basic asss character.

oh also, all the female character (or almost) have huge butts and boobs that have jiggle physics. Its not really a kids game tbh."
4683,Bugs are there.. but fun to play...
4684,Great free game - as any free game you get trolls and I suspect parents that use the game as their kids babysitter.
4685,its so nice and fun
4686,Don't bother. The game has serious issues that can't be avoided. Loading screen bugs that keep people out of games. Extremely low quality matches. You have an AFK in 90% of games. It's a joke.
4687,great game with alot of characters.... its addicting. graphics are good .But many bugs lol that neeed to be fixed.
4688,Pog
4689,yea this is really similar to overwatch but it's also unique enough to enjoy.

but the money system is too slow you have to grind very hard to buy the character."
4697,"great game never any bugs ever :)
"
4698,"Do not give this game any of your money !

1. The game is filled with BOTS by the devs because if not the que times would be over an hour.

2.Matchmaking is non existent, after you hit level 25 you will be matched against pro players while you are still learning the game. After 60+ games this has not changed for me.

3. IN RANKED YOU GET NINTENDO SWITCH AND PS4 PLAYERS ON YOUR TEAM WHO ARE USING A CONTROLLER OMG

4. Game designed for kids/teens with literal hentai/pornography in some obnoxious places

5. Easy-Anti cheat (Aim-botters and hackers are very common)

6. Bugs that have never been fixed cause over half your games to be a loss because someone disconnected.

Unplayable in its current state, especially after hitting 25. The game falls off a cliff after the devs have secured maybe some of your $$$"

4733,"Paladins was here before Overwatch, and I'm hilariously happy to say that it's still here after Overwatch."
4734,"Maybe if the actual gameplay was more rewarding it would be better but for now the only grind is on your pocket, nothing to earn besides skin recolors and other things no one cares about. Similar issue in Overwatch but at least they'll throw you a bone for leveling and playing matches. Fun to come back to every now and then but don't expect any overall improvements."
4735,"This is basically a slot machine with no payout. The actual competition was corrupted and destroyed years ago, what's left is some match-fixing political groups and a whole lot of aimless derp. It's a management problem that extends to all titles by this publisher. It's genuinely unfortunate, they provide very close to the ideal format for PvP games... and then systematically destroy it. Hopefully some other publisher takes the parts of their formula that aren't self-cancelling, and runs the right direction with it."

I originally had a lengthy review at a previous time but it was deleted, so I simplified it and made the above. As I see this review has gotten attention recently I have decided to elaborate and condense my original review.  I haven't played the game for many months but I stand by my original thoughts from that time:

The staff responsible for the art, models and character creation are clearly beyond competent and good at their job. The issue is that there had been no gameplay tweaks for over a year at the time, game modes were removed, features were removed with no alternatives in place no new maps and matchmaking was terrible. The inability or unwillingness to address griefing and AFK players ruined the experience of many matches. This combined with a lack of any interest from the development team to address these issues has resulted in a stagnant game that's more concerned with selling cosmetics than doing anything to grow the community which is a true shame because the mechanics are great and the game is genuinely enjoyable. 

So if the devs don't care, why should you?"

4800,Better then overwatch
4801,very good very nice
4802,great game
4803,"So MUCH FUN but difficult sometimes
"
4804,"i played this a ton a while back on my ps4, its great"
4805,yes
4806,This is a game that you can play
4807,"It's kinda like Overwatch's low budget cousin. It's super fast pace and great fun though. Expect to love this game one moment and then want to remove its existence from your brain the next. Very much a love/hate relationship
"
4808,"As a F2P hero shooter, its pretty good. I mean, it has bugs, and the matchmaking leaves much to be desired, but overall i enjoy playing this game very much. I think if you have played overwatch and you would understand this game, and may even grow to appreciate it even more than OW."
4809,very good alternative for overwatch
4810,"I waited and downloaded 30GB, so i could play for 20 minutes, that game is so fucking bad my 6 year old brother could make a better game with python.
It's a really cool and fun game, i recomment downloading, worth!"
4811,Esse jogo é simplesmente PERFEITO EU AMO MUITO ESSE JOGO MEU DEUS
4812,game!!
4813,"Pro:
 -Characters and play styles and d
 -Ability's and game play are solid
 -Map size's are perfect for 5v5
 -Graphics are good and network is solid. Fast Que times.

Con:
 -Add new characters instead of balancing old ones.
 - Kills are too quick imo, sometimes feel like CoD
 -Characters need balancing to make all viable

Summary: Solid game and arguably the best in the genera in my opinion.  I would like to see combat updated with damage scaling adjustments.  ie. Tanks to be able to fend of a flank 1v1. As I want more of a fight and not kill or be killed in a 3sec window, push this out to 10 or 15 sec to force ability cool downs and skill to decide winners.  With some game play mechanics adjustments this has potential to be on top.  Yet I feel devs will not go this route and will continue to add new characters."
4814,After 72 hours playing the game I log back in for the first time since 2018 o to find data is lost along with all my dlc purchased.
4815,Game Is not good. Needs a lot of balancing of champions.
4816,Nice
4817,yee
4818,pay to win characters
4819,The queue times are pretty low but character balance is shit and there are so few maps to play on with the same few gamemodes over and over.  Playerbase can be super toxic at times and seems to be only getting more so as I play with no way to alleviate harassment from other players. Wanted to change my username and can only do it with real dollars so I switched over to the Epic launcher.
4820,"I like this game because of how many updates come out so often, i remember when i was younger i played this for like 10 hours a day...i HIGHLY suggest this if you or anybody you might know be into PVP and tournaments or even just a friendly 1V1 between you and your friend, Good Luck Out There Champion."
4821,FREE OVERWATCH MY DUDES
4822,"Nice

Edit: I remember playing this game when it was still in beta, and the game has come a long way since then.
Paladins has some great upsides and some obvious downsides. I'm comparing it to Overwatch, as i had over 500 hours in overwatch. The game has a wealth of champions, much more diversity with only a couple champions feeling the same. The loadouts and talents as well as the items you can buy allow you to change certain aspects of a character to fit your playstyle, and i love it. The rigidity of Overwatch characters got stale after enough time, and this game allows you to change things up how you want to. The real problem comes from AFK players and hackers, no real punishment for leaving and in my 100 hours since comeing back i have played against at least 2 hackers in Normal non-competitive gameplay."

4830,"fun  and fast paced fps game with a good but not too much amount of lore that is interesting and understandable to simply enplane how the character works, the amazing yet not overwhelming amount of characters you can play are all connected somehow and with there somewhat unique weapons guns swords and such makes this fps game more than what i expected it to be no mater what type of gamer you are you will diffidently find a character with your play style  and maybe hopefully more champions to come."

4866,"I have put entirely too much of my life into this stupid game. 

there's a lot of tangential bullsh*t that comes with the package, like bugs, lag, balance issues, bugs, occasionally braindead dev decisions, and more bugs, but the core gameplay is so darn good that i just can't bring myself to hate it. 

This is a team-based MOBA shooter that gives you a ton of characters, abilities, talents, and customizations to play with. There are oodles of builds, meme strats, and team comps to try, and the gameplay loop never feels like it devolves into the shoot, get instagibbed, respawn, repeat hellhole that games like TF2 and overwatch tend to end up with. 

All of the classes are fun to play too. Tanks are fun, healers are fun, dmg is fun... the skins cosmetics are also top quality, with most skins getting entirely new body models and voice packs.

Download it.

you'll hate yourself for it, but it will also be fun"

4871,good game ghet good
4872,This game gets no balance patches or anything. They make a Character and release it and they are so OP. Also there is no skilled match making. At this point new players are just Youtube content for sweats to make a living because they have no other skills but to sit and steal fun from others.
4873,YES
4874,Great Game!
4875,"its a good game, play it!"
4876,"This game has so much potential, but falls flat, because the executives don't want the developers to release new maps or gamemodes. They remove UI elements such as 3rd person, POTG and death replay, because they are ""too buggy"". Your job as a developer is to fix the bugs not remove the thing that caused the bugs, that means you have failed as a game developer. Unless the thing was gamebreaking, there is no reason to remove it.

But why is the game losing players? Because new champions are not good content, we want good gamemodes like payload and literally anything that isn't siege (siege is hot garbage that gets boring after 2 games). And no, siege unleashed or whatever the fuck it's called, is not good, it's shit and boring, just give us fucking payload. But no, instead, they decide to release new champions constantly to keep the money rolling in, but they could make the game good and get more money in the long run, but Hi-rez has this thing called ""The Hi-rez effect"" where they don't have faith in the game and abandon it after like a year of development. Prime example is Realm Royale. This shit was getting top charts on twitch and it was amazing, but unfinished. We didn't really care because we had a hot mess called PUBG as a game (and we all know how buggy that game was). Then they went ahead and made absolute dogshit changes that made the game unfun to play and instead of reverting the changes, they decided to go with it while the game was losing players. Then when the game was dying they started adding microtransactions into the game like there's no tomorrow. Now realm royale is just a corpse, dead, literally no one plays it anymore. 
If they don't start taking risks and you know, actually start doing something with their games, Paladins is going to suffer the same fate realm royale did. Don't get me wrong, I love the game, but this is fucking ass. This game could be a serious competitor against tf2 as a class based shooter, but the executives don't care, they only care about money they make right now on the spot, without realizing that hi-rez could become a really big company by just taking a few risks. Smite makes you enough money to fund development for other games, but instead, they are copying Blizzard and adding in more microtransactions and making absolutely no good content (unless it makes them money).

In short: Paladins is dying, Hi-rez is greedy and doesn't care, this game is going to become another realm royale if they don't do anything about the playercount."
4877,GG
4878,"Previously I said I like the game, it's still fun to play, but this game has a bug that makes it unplayable and today is the 3rd time ive experienced it.

Basically you load into a match, select a hero and then it loads the game, nobody successful loads, you are taken back to the pick screen, where people can communicate (its especially bad cuase theres one guy who shouts into his mic and you cant mute it because muting doesnt work in the pick screen for whatever reason) but nothing happens, you cant leave, youre just stuck there. If you relaunch the game, it takes you to load the match again and then it takes you to the main menu after like 2 minutes, then you cant do anything in the main menu... like no buttons work, cant exit, everything is unuseable. 

Shit experience, if the gameplay wasnt enjoyable, id drop this game but i have a lot of fun with it. I will gladly change the review once this 2 YEAR OLD BUG has been fixed."

4884,TOo much unknown crashes
4885,"what the hell you doing developers game? It takes me to the menu while playing and it is no longer possible to continue the previous game. Your game gets more awful after each update. I did not expect your game to be so bad. Sorry to waste my time playing for paladins. After playing for three years, I will delete this game today..goodbye buggy game. before new update Repair previous bugs version."

4893,good game
4894,"This game has probably one of the worst matchmaking I've ever seen and I played TF2 and its significantly better, imo. Once you get to a certain level, the game will act as if you can carry the team on your own and gives you the most inexperienced player they can give you and the opposite team is like the most overpowered team in existence. Ever since I reached level 25, I haven't been winning a single match.

I really don't think they're gonna fix this cuz its been going on for years now but I seriously would like to be proven wrong.

Hi-Rez, you got SOME pretty good characters but you really need to fix the bloody matchmaking cuz it ain't so pretty right now."
4895,Overwatch but with more depth and replayability.
4896,Its just a really fun game and ive been playing for years.
4897,"Its my favorite game on Steam.

The good: They have characters for every type of player and style. Maps are big and some are labyrinths. Lots of fun. Doesn't crash or ends out of nowhere. You can personalize your character gameplay with different cards that boost your atributtes or helps teammates etc...

The bad: A lot of characters skins, etc... can only buy them with crystals, you get them by playing but its very time consuming, and the majority of the skins are only avaliable by season pass - which you need real money to get. 

The ugly: The european survers have some bug loading issues...just change to US/Canada and you'll be fine."

4912,"I really like the game.  There are people  who don't  like grinding a lot for getting a new character,  but at least this game gives you the chance to get them by grinding.

There are some things that must be improved like some op chatacters at the moment (Betty La Bomba,  Raum,  etc) , but overall,  the game is very good."
4913,"So the game it self is fun and all, but the moment bugs start hitting u is when u stop playing this game. The game keeps crashing mind game on EU servers.

4914,OH MY GOD THIS IS EPIC AND THIS IS FUN TO PLAY THIS I WANT TO PLAY AND ITS EASY TO LEVEL UP OK FINE I'LL GONNA RECCOMEND THIS TO MY FRIENDS
4915,"at least the community is much more alive than overwatch, the game is anjoyable with so many player much more laidback than overwatch and its not very competitive in the quickmatch. skin isnt free (some are) but the plus side is they actually make the skin have a custom voice, custom sfx, and custom character card that make some of them worth it.... the down side is most of  the paid skin is lock behing a chest or lootbox, so you either get the skin you want or some skin that you dont want."
4916,"Copy of Overwatch, I love it."
4917,no
4918,Now see this review is only for the fact of they legit spit in the OG players faces When they change most of the core gameplay let alone removing Caut and making it a normal thing that gets worse over time??? What is the point in healing if it gets to 90% They need to stop Messing with the core mechanics and keep to what worked so well in the past instead of this mess they call the new core mechanics....
4919,"Paladins used to be a good game. Now it is not. I had so much fun with this game, yet nowadays the game is just falling off quickly. They add so much content so fast and the game feels terrible to play. Its janky and unresponsive, and the champion balance is terrible. However, there’s a good chance the game will be good when you play it, it’s just dependant on if the devs know what they’re doing."
4920,"Absolutely Love this game!

So many incredibly fun and diverse characters for all sorts of playstyles.

It would be nice if they improved the store though. Way too many lootboxes and things are waaay overly priced in most instances.

That being said I would be happy to pay for some more direct purchases if they were made available."

4950,"Well, after almost a 1000 hours over the course of 2+ years, and getting a tattoo relating to the game, I should probably recommend Paladins.

Paladins was my first ever FPS, and I fell in love with it. I've met a lot of people through the community, and strengthened already existing friendships. The graphics and character design is enjoyable, and the gameplay itself is also fun. They have slowly started to rework older maps, which is bringing them up to the newer ones visually. But I must also agree that the name ''Bugadins'' is deserved. For a free to play game though, it is still very much playable and enjoyable, even with the hiccups.

This game updates frequently with new champions, so getting bored isn't too much of an issue. Some new character abilities are a bit repetitive, but often make up for it in the big picture of each champion. The balancing works out well in ranked, as each team gets to ban 3 champions. This makes it easier for you make the match adapt to your teams' playstyle. And as each champion comes with 3 talents to choose from, you can really play how you like, even hopping the lines between roles sometimes. The game doesn't put a limit on how a team must be formed (apart from meta), so it's even possibly for the whole team to choose the same role. This kind of freedom isn't seen so often with similar FPS games.

Overall, if you want a fun, free FPS game to try out with your friends, I'd highly recommend Paladins."
4951,"As much as I like the characters, the gameplay and some of the maps, I can't recommend it, purely because the overwatch design philosophy is trash. Yes, hero shooters are fun. No, having a second guy healing the guy you should have been able to kill is not fun. And they're aware of that fact because they've changed the anti-heal item to being a permanent addition to the game, instead of, y'know, reworking how anti-fun healers are and how the game should not revolve around someone who kinda isn't playing the game just making everyone else immortal unless you're the most cracked shot you could possibly be. Healers in Smite are actually balanced and fun to play around, because they don'T fucking burst heal an entire healthbar in one button press, they just add sustain to the fight.

Tanks are also not fun, you kinda just don't deal enough damage to kill them. In TF2 the heavy is a fun character to play against because you can actually kill him and he can actually kill you. In Paladins/Overwatch, a tank is just kinda there for you to empty your entire kit and mag on and still not kill him, and he can sometimes kill you but not really, they don't really deal any damage because that would be broken. So you essentially just have a fat kid to bully who happens to make it very hard for you to play the game normally. In Smite the tanks serve a purpose, they pushed the frontline up and bully the backline so your team can deal their damage without getting instaggibed. You can't kill them, they can't kill you, but they don't stop you from playing the game, they just make you play differently. Not at all the case with shield tanks, and especially not the case if they're backed by a healer.

Also the ""minor"" gripe of the game being filled with tiny characters that keep jumping over your head. It's not that hard to deal with but playing against 5 genjis is not my idea of a good game.

So yeah. Game would be extremely good if it wasn't trying to be overwatch, because the characters are fun to play as, but they're not fun to play against, so fuck this.

Also fuck betty"
4952,"It's fun, and as a game it's doing a not bad job."
4953,I Love this game
4954,"Buggadins , a game with a lot of potential wasted by deaf developers that with each update somehow manage to introduce new bugs that aren't patched for months. I wish they sell it already to some other studio."
4955,Your new character betty is annoying
4956,"There is WAY too much feminist people that would get your account banned, if you insult their prejudice. I wish we had the glory 360 days again, where people can take shit, instead of crying. Jesus Christ, what has this world coming too?"
4957,"Actually this game is just the child born from the cosplayers of League and Overwatch, who found crack in a back alley."
4958,glitchhhhhhhhhh
4959,its a really well thought of game me and my friends have a great time goofing around in this game. They also have a ranked for the sweats out there.
4960,Finally came back to the game after a year and managed to catch a 7 day suspension for calling out horrible players. Don't bother returning to this dying game.
4961,literally overwatch
4962,Buggy ass game/Cringe lootbox gambling
4963,Very fun game but if the game freezes after you loaded into a match and puts you back in the character select area you can't play the game for 1.5-3 hours. Otherwise its a very good game that I recommend you play it.
4964,I like Men
4965,"not bad or good lmao...
mid tier but far from bad"
4966,its a good team game babes
4967,"Fun game if you're not solo, aethestic is really retro-fantasy if you're into that. it's free, try and like it or not. 

Personally liked it until SEA became a cesspool, but other regions should be fine"
4968,"If I would listen to myself at the moment I wright that comment, I would give a negative vote, but the fact is that despite seeing the game going down and down updates after updates, I still love it. But I think that if it continues that way I probably won't touch it anymore. What's the problem (in my opinion) ? Well...

 The role of support/healer is hard in that game, not that the champ themselves are hard to play (actually most of them are quite easy to take in hand) but because of the impact of the flanks champ. I mean yeah, killing the supp is one of their job, but do we really need more OPAF flanks right now ? If the enemy team has a good skye for example, 1/2 times the game is over. Some flanks are quite balanced, like some are ridiculously easy to play and have a way too big potential and impact when you compare to how easy to play they are.

Until quite recently, playing tank was IMPOSSIBLE due to people making only dps with healers, and that was caused by a perk that sooo much players were complaining about for years : Anti-heal (I mean the one that you buy while in game, because the few heroes that have anti heal on their spells are not so powerful to me)

 This perk was horrible, I think that a lot of people would agree on that point, and the fact that they removed it from the game could be a proof. So what ? Now that AH is no more, healers are healing ? Yes ! Tanks are surviving and the role is enjoyable ? Yes ! Then everything is okay about that ? Ahahaha, would be too easy, don't you think ?

 Yes, the perk anti heal was removed... Until one day a dev was thinking ""Yeah, it´s big brain time !"" and decided that now, Anti Heal would be a passive ability FOR EVERY CHARACTERS that increases in strength with the time of the game... I just have a question about that... Seriously ? Healing was not complicated enough that now every champ can ruin your job ? I REALLY hope that it's just a test and that they won't keep it because it's the worst update I've seen since I started to play that game (I have ""only"" 45 hours on Steam but I also played a lot on PS4)

And you know what's the most painful about that ? It's that I hate talking bad about Paladins because the game is really good, it has a huge potential and you can have so much fun with it. I hoped that some of the skins would be available differently than by paying (some are, but not much) but well it's only cosmetics and the game is free, that's normal that they want to make money somehow. 

So in conclusion, we have here a really good game, I just hope that they will listen to the community about that because at that point, they could also remove the support heroes that would not make much of difference (I overeact a bit, i know)"
4969,"in 2016, Paladins is a cheap Overwatch
in 2022, Overwatch is a cheap Paladins"
4970,its aight
4971,not bad if u dont have money for overwatch
4972,I have still not unlocked all the champions
4973,bad
4974,VERY NICE GAME
4975,"its overwatch's rtarded cousin but way better imo
"
4976,nice
4977,Free Overwatch
4978,"Horrible, shit game I hit the scoreboard button once and it fucking stayed on my screen the whole time"
4979,awesome
4980,fun
4981,"trash game no balance,go buy overwatch"
4982,"It's a nice game where you play in teams of 5v5. I should know, at least I think it's good to be playing since it's free to play. I've played it for years since the beta, and it has a few issues that arise every once in a blue moon. But, if you just want to play a game similar to Overwatch, and for free, this is a good alternative. However, it has some uniqueness to it, and I find it stands on it's own as a competitor. Or, playing both if you like the variety."
4983,"better than overwatch imo, independently a solid game"
4984,"i was lucky enough to play this game in CB, when in my opinion this game peaked. It was more unique, then the last time i played it. It would've been a bigger hit, it wouldnt hirez made it.
In conclousion: hirez screwed up hard, but it still an enjoyable game."
4985,"Only playing this game because of Evie, fun champ :)

Another good point about the game is that you do not need aim to be alright in this game, due to lots of AOE attackers or healers
"
4986,nice
4987,yes
4988,"In earlier versions of the game, there was a item to buy called cauterize. This was the only anti heal item. however the devs took it out in order to save everyone the trouble of buying it (because it was the ONLY anti heal) 
now to replace anti heal they have a anti heal passive applied to everyone, which worked great for a short time being. as of the bomb queen patch, the anti heal is busted. it just builds up over time due to the devs buffing the passive anti heal. 
so if you want to tank? dont. if you want to heal? dont. you have to dps check the other team to have a chance to win. please fix this? although with the lack of respect they have towards the fanbase i doubt they will."
4989,just yes.
4990,It is a good game
4991,goog game need recoginition
4992,very fun not rip off overwatch just try it
4993,It is a very nice game to play with friends
4994,like overwatch but for poor people
4995,"THIS GAME IS VICIOUS O.O not actually that i would not recommend it, but if your prone to raging and breaking your mouse/keyboard you better be good at games xD. also everyone talks shit if you dont do well half the time even if your brand new lol but i guess thats part of the fun!"
4996,gg
4997,"It's a good game, but riddled with either technical issues and baffling decisions that ultimately has taken a toll on their playerbase over the years.

Unless they do something extraordinary, the game's just gonna keep bleeding players, which is a shame because despite all that it's been through, Paladins has been an enjoyable game. If you have a couple of hours to burn and just want to try something out, feel free to give it a try."

5001,"good game, no bad game or great game, but good game"
5002,"The game is alive and kicking, the developer keep adding new champions, I would advocate to try this game, this game is pretty good."
5003,I KEEP OSING I HATE THIS GAME
5004,very good very nice
5005,"Buggy as shit, near impossible to get new characters without spending irl money, and the servers crash around 50% of the time. Still, better than Overwatch though."
5006,hm
5007,Better than Overwatch.
5008,I really like the fantasy part of it. It may be a bit of a rip off of overwatch but its still a good game. This game has a lot of versatile characters and I love the fact that you can build your own personal kind of character with the card part. The characters in this game do cost money which you will earn over time which might be a bit annoying to some people but thats the worst part of it.
5009,dogshit game cant even start properly
5010,full of poor tryhards
5011,this game is good
5012,"So long time ago I played this game very long on the old PC of my dad and to be fair it was great. I was not allowed to play Overwatch so I got this game and it made so much fun. But as I grow up it doesnt feel that great anymore. Maybe its just because I played way more games. Still, its one of my most played games on PC and I have great memories with it.
It just doesnt apeal to me anymore. But thats not the games fault. (Sry cant speak good english :c)

5031,I bought the founds pack for this game when it first came out thinking it was going to be the next big thing.  Deep regret.
5032,"I have just shy of a thousand hours in this game. It can be fun but there is just so much shit to deal with. Broken champions, loads of bugs, one of which just doesnt let you play the gaem for a few hours, and poor management have just killed it for me. It's not all bad, but eventually it becomes super frustrating. Try it out, but don't stivk around too long."
5033,i was banned for saying racial slurs. dont play this game
5034,nice game
5035,Adictive stupid game
5036,"incredibly underrated game. I've taken a few week breaks here and there due to life, but this game is always in my rotation. I love the characters, they are well designed and balance seems to be a priority to the devs. This game is 100% free and that is the real impressive part. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the hero shooter genre."
5037,good game
5038,low key really fun lmao
5039,"It's fun, but very flawed. I always reccomend this game with a massive "" * """
5040,Deserves more love than it gets.
5041,"Everyone who plays this game is retarded. If you like playing tank or support do not play this game. Best strategy is to just go all DPS, which makes the game boring af."
5042,i love this game
5043,good
5044,"a wonderful game that I think should be tried by anyone whose played a competitive FPS. 

the characters are very diverse and the game has so much counterplay because of items you can buy mid round. cards are also a way the game introduces ways to tailor a champion the way you want them to be. do you want to maybe invest a lot into this one skill you really like using? you can center your build around that, and I think that is absolutely amazing. the game has so much depth, and I think it's crazy because at the surface it looks like some ugly mobile game.

I do seriously think the game is on a timer though, it doesn't have that big of a playerbase and it's absolutely ridden with bugs, like, an obscene amount. I think that if they stopped releasing a new champion like every month and just worked on the game at it's core, fixing all it's bugs and implementing new features/maps to draw players in would do it some good. and they definitely gotta work on their balancing, which in all honesty is better than most games i've played, but the way they do things is really frustrating, sometimes unneeded nerfs happen that can really devastate a champion.

I really do think evilmojo/Hi-Rez have a goldmine on their hands, and they either don't know it, or just don't care. In the right hands this IP could've come close to rival even something as titanic as valorant. I really hope they open their eyes someday, maybe the games code is too  incoherent at this point for much to be done, and I can accept that to a degree. If Paladins got a clean slate with a sequel, I genuinely do think it could become one of the greats.

I do think this is like, a top 10 game of mine aaaand IT'S COMPLETELY FREE so there's no harm in trying it at the very least. 

TLDR - Great team based FPS with unrivaled build customization, held back by its developers."
5045,Couldn't even play the game. I tried over 100 different unique names and they were either censored for no reason or they were taken somehow.
5046,"its good
"
5047,Walmart Overwatch..
5048,"Paladins came out at a weird time for hero shooters. It has been called an overwatch clone and other things to that extent. Coming back to it years later it's just a good game, people were just being rude. If you like hero shooters and you think Paladins looks cool, give it a shot because you'll have fun with it."

5057,"yes, it's overwatch but free"
5058,Fun and chill. When you dont have a DC player it's enjoyable.
5059,"Dear Hi-Rez. All players know how much you hate supports. But this time you have outdone yourself. 90% cauterize at 10 minutes, provided that games last on average longer than 15, and scaling starts from standing at the base from the very first second of being in the match. You are dooming support players to a miserable existence for more than half of the game. Why not remove supports altogether? And tanks at the same time. Why add more heals to supports if it will eventually come down to 10% of the total by the middle of the match. 
This game does not need magical abilities and healing, because it's a shooter. Let's go together along the path of becoming the coolest shooter like CS:GO and APEX, because there are very few such games, and there are a great many fantasy and colorful ones based on interesting abilities. (sarcasm)"
5060,game is fun
5061,"developers are very bad, no balance, bugs and glitches that havent been fixed for years, cringe"
5062,"lol
"
5063,"I love this game so much, but, It is one of the most toxic games i have ever played in. They also seem to never patch bugs and their idea of a patch is to just slap on some new content. most of which appears to be unbalanced. Again i love this game and will continue playing it, but honestly cant recommend it. When i first started playing it the new champion was terminus and he was new and exciting but as of recent all the champions seem to just be reskins of eachother or champions from other games"

5121,"The developers don't care about this game, it's updates or it's community. all they care about is making it big by releasing the next cool new character or skin that almost always ends up being absolute trash, ruining the established meta, while the game's spaghetti code continues ruining the already dying playerbase's ability to join lobbies. AND NO I'M *NOT* JUST SALTY BECAUSE I MISSED A SKIN BECAUSE OF THIS GAME'S BATTLE PASS PREDATORY BUSINESS PRACTICE BULLSHIT RUINING MY DAY!

thanks for coming to my ted talk, please consider donating to my tipping hat when you see me curled up on the corner of your street, fund my children's tuition, fund my alcoholism to help me get over a recent tragedy that has befallen me, and most of all, DON'T FUND THIS GAME UNTIL THE DEVELOPERS HAVE LEARNED THEY NEED TO FIX GAMEPLAY ISSUES INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAKE IT BIG THROUGH NEW SHITTY CHARACTERS OR WASTING TIME TRYING TO REPLACE THE COMMUNITY'S ESTABLISHED SUBREDDIT WITH SOME SHITTY DEV MADE CIRCLEJERK

5209,yes
5210,"Paladins is commonly compared to Overwatch due to the similarities with the games I will sometimes reference the latter game. 

THE GREAT:
- Paladins has a card system in which you can modify/buff certain skills depending on your playstyle. You can set up multiple builds which is nice. This is the main difference between the games as Overwatch all characters are exactly the same.
- Paladins adds an extra/unique character mechanic in the flank classes. These characters specialize in infiltrating the enemy teams back lines to cause havoc on back lines (snipers, healers, etc.).


THE GOOD:
- Paladins has in match currency in which players can purchase upgrades for their character. This rewards players that play well during the match. Even though these items do give players who play well an advantage, they are not as strong as MOBA style items where players with more money become overpowerful.
- Like any game Paladins has characters that are deemed by the community as stronger than others, but few characters fall into the overpowered category (when allowed in competitive matches). All characters have the potential to be good in the right hands. Some characters do have a higher learning curve, but most of the characters are useful in some fashion.
- The ingame cash shop is strictly cosmetic. There is no ""pay to win"" in Paladins.
- The competitive match ranking system in Paladins rewards players who win consecutivly. For instance, if a Silver 2 player wins 7 matches in a row and ranks up, he can skip Silver 1 and go to Gold 4 or 5.
- There are 4 games modes to choose from as well as an additional game mode that changes weekly.
- No matter which game-mode you play the game-play is fast paced. There is rarely a moment where you are not engaged with another player.
- New characters come out frequently, usually every other month. All be it, you won't be able to play them in competitive matches until they have been out for a month.
- Servers are usually stable, very seldom do I find myself lagging or disconnection.

THE NEUTRAL (comments placed here have pros/cons):
- The competitive match system in Paladins has the traditional pick/ban phase. While I do enjoy this feature, it also can lead to conflict within a team. Sometimes you get that last pick player that WILL play damage regardless of what the team actually needs. The game has yet to incorporate a system where players Que as a particular role. 
- Unlike Overwatch you will not be able to change a character mid match. Once you choose your character you are locked in until match completion. 
- Paladins retains the typical roles of tank, healer and damage.
- There are a few characters in Paladins that share many similarities to Overwatch characters. Examples are Fernando (Paladins) vs Reinhart (Overwatch), Viktor (Paladins) vs Soldier 76 (Overwatch), and Drogoz (Paladins) vs Pharah (Overwatch). These characters are not an exact spitting image of each other, but for Overwatch players wanting to test the game out they give you something familiar. 
- The graphics in this game are not as clean and pretty as Overwatch. Graphics are more similar to Borderlands style graphics.


THE BAD:
- Most maps in Paladins are just too small. With the fact that there are mounts to get back to the action faster. Once one team gains and advantage they usually keep that advantage. Getting a kill in Paladins is significantly less effective than in Overwatch where it takes an opponent precious time to get back to the action.
- While the skins in Paladins do have a certain ascetic value, it is often costly and painful to get the skin you desire. Some skins are able to be purchase outright with either earned or purchase currency, however most are not. Most skins require players to buy different treasure chests and players basically ""roll the dice"" on obtaining skins they desire. Each chest has a certain number of skins available within. Some chests only have single digit skins obtainable within which do increase the chances of getting that skin you want. 
- Typical of any free to play, team based, competitive game you WILL find trolls and flammers. They are not as abundant as games like League of Legends, but they are most definitely present.

THE WORST:
- Paladins always has a few bugs after any major update. In most cases these bugs are simply annoying, however, they often take weeks for developers to fix. At the time of this review the major bug is the inability to mute a single player by voice. If there is some player you do not wish to hear you will have to turn off all voice chat.

5211,"It's a great game, but I've never seen more bugs in a single game, and I'd play tested a lot of games in their  alphas. The devs are trying, but publisher just doesn't care, they only sell skins for easy profit while major problems known for years are not being addressed. Game needs a complete rework, because its basic programming is bugged beyond help, but of course that will not happen, so don't waste your time on this. Cheers."

The only things I have issues with are some characters being too similar to others (Viktor, Vivian and Tyra for example) and tons of cosmetic things to get in loot boxes which some of the skins aren't avaliable anymore :(

No bugs at all, incredibly balanced champions, graphics hitting harder than your dad when you skipped school.
At least that's literally any game out there compared to this. I'd rather play roblox shooters than put any hour more in this game.
The only thing hitting hard in this game is the bullshit that the balancing team put into this game. You have the squishies that can deal *some* damage and then you have the 6k health tank that stuns, deals incredibly much damage and heals himself. Every support in this game is better of as a flank or dps since cauterize brings your healing in the negative.

It's really not a enjoyable game anymore and hi rez screwed this one (again) up."

Paladins doesn't have much of a fan-base more of a wide community of people who are dedicated to paladins that a whole wide known game. But its respectable, its an amazing game I've spent hours on when I was playing ps4. I highly recommend to be a game to have in your back pocket if you feel competitive."

5373,"I have played this game for about 8 hours. The communication system in this game is seriously bad. People don't communicate. For as far as champions you can pick they are quite good designed, but the way they look it's not my style. 

So if you are looking for a decent shooter, go take a look at either a BR in Apex or Warzone. Or go play a game like Valorant or CS:GO. But don't go play this game... Thinking you are going to have a great time. The public queues are either people that don't understand a single thing about the game... Or people that are sweating."

5378,"The idea of the game is fun but the matchmaking seems really odd, no matter how much you lose you still keep getting matched against real sweatlords, very rarely do you get a close game with even teams. It's mostly getting rolled or being on the rolling team.

Also in my personal opinion the game does a really poor job at indicating received damage so most deaths feel like instant kills, but there are things in this game that do kill you near instantly too.

Weirdly enough i enjoy the training/bot matches the most because there you get to enjoy the game without feeling like you are playing in a 500k USD tournament, but the training/bot matches get boring really quickly because of how easy they are. There is no middle ground in this game, its either super easy with bot matches or the rolling veteran team or its super sweaty and hard while getting rolled by the veteran team.

(all of these experiences are from matches played with 1-2 friends who are the same skill level as me)

I occasionally have a fun game but for the most part it's just frustrating as hell.

EDIT: Recently there has been a ton of issues joining matches, there is roughly 20% chance that some sort of issue happens and best case, you have to requeue. In the worst case, your whole PC blue screens or you get stuck in a join loop to a bugged match and can't play anymore. At the moment i'm stuck in the latter, tried to play a quick match or 2 and the match didn't load so i force closed the game trough Task manager, after restarting it attempted to reconnect me to the match, it loads for 3 mins before kicking me back to the menu and i can't click anything ingame anymore, forcing me to restart which starts the reconnect again."
5379,to many furrys
5380,"Bugs bugs bugs bugs. Overall a fun experience with lots of characters and easy abilities. but lack of ways to play the game, lack of rewards for actually playing(outside paying money) and almost inexistent community make it a game that's hard to recommend. There is hardly any effort put into making this game playable and fun, they just add new content.

Bugs aren't fixed for 6 months even if they're occuring to anyone weekly and the remaining community is 90% toxic, while still so small. and the game is plenty old. Graphics are not to my liking at all but the maps and servers seem ok to me. 

Overall, i'd say the studio making this and the people involved don't like playing this game at all."

5389,"Edit: After playing over 300 matches, they is something that bothers me. You can not view a replay of your own match, Unless, You have someone spectate you. To get around this i have an ALT account that i have to /spectate <player> to be able to make the game record a replay so i can then /replay <match id> on my main account. I do this to catch cheaters that may be in my game, but even after all that, cheaters can password themselves to stop you viewing them within the spectated game. They needs to be a simpler way.

An amazing third-person hero/class shooter. It ticks all the right boxes. More advanced then Overwatch, more fun then Overwatch,faster paced compared to Overwatch too. So much to learn, so many characters to master. Continuous updates make this game worth returning to.
Sure they is some balancing issues, sure they is some rough edges, like queues sometime's bug out, or the odd crash, but it is definitely worth playing."
5390,"This game has had it's ups and downs, times when it was very buggy and unplayable competitively and times like recently(for the last year or 2) where it's incredibly polished and MLG worthy. 

The game has always been very unique and special, from the art to the twist on a champion shooter using moba systems and as you can see from my playtime one of my top 3 favorite games.

Considering how similar it is to Overwatch I feel I can rightfully say there is almost no reason to ever play Overwatch, this game is hands down, no contest, leagues better in every aspect I can think about above Overwatch.

My only complaint with the game is how sensitive the developers and the community are. My best friend is from Pakistan, there is no reason for the word ""paki"" to be censored, at all. That is just one of hundreds of words that are censored with a chat filter. People afk out of games in ranked constantly because they're sure we are going to lose when the truth is I have around 10k hours(didn't start playing on steam) in the game and i've been to masters so I can confidently tell you that even top tier players don't really fully understand the meta. The game is too complex when you get down to the nitty gritty, there are far too many variables and i've seen teams win that according to top tier players shouldn't.

Overall I highly recommend the game."

5432,"Paladins, I got into this thinking that this was a cheap low quality game but it actually looks amazing and plays smoothly. Almost all champions are really well balanced and that’s hard to accomplish considering how many ways you can customize your settings and gameplay during and before matches. Paladins is really about customization. One champion can be played as a passive backline healer in one match and an amazing dps character with lots of crowd control in the next. It all depends on how you alter your champion’s “loadout”, and this makes the game so much fun and I never get bored. The pacing is perfect too~ the fights actually give you time to think and react and there are tons of outplay opportunities."

5441,"Gameplay is great. The graphics aren't anything to write home about but it's not bad. People compare it to overwatch a lot and while it' similar in that it's a moba-esque FPS game, it does a LOT to set itself apart. If you like overwatch or the moba genre you'd probably really enjoy this. The biggest thing holding this back is the bugs, the queue times, and the lack of a role-designation system."
5442,"Please, just don't play it."
5443,Devs are furrys SMH my head
5444,Good game
5445,Nice game :thumbup:
5446,not good
5447,"I cant in all good heart suggest this game...im 600+ hrs in and i have to force myself to play it. The dev team only cares about releasing the next new hero so they can rake in the money. They give zero F^#K'S about the balance or bug issues wich there are ALOT in this game.

The biggest gleering issue is match making, its non existant. Im bronze, a low lvl casual player...i play for fun so i stick to my QM...but match making is such a broken joke im being put up against players that are in the grand master rank with over 1-2k hrs in the dam game!!!! How can anyone have fun when you spawn and die spawn n die spawn n die because someone with inhuman reflexes and aim bot like percision is on the other team...."
5448,I couldn't play any FPS game with my old laptop but Paladins serve the best quality for minimum requirements graphics. Play it with your friend and you'll have some scratch there.

5451,Good
5452,not a bad game its a mixture between overwatch and LOL

5496,"Full of bugs. Crashes, not loading, black screens... is shit"
5497,"The game gets worse and worse over time:
1) Bugs in game - often the game is disconnected from server, often you got stuck in load screen, or in post game screen
2) The community here is extra toxic. Almost every game you get to team a person that does not cooperate, that trolls or goes afk
3) The developers don't care about the above. Over the years there is no improvement."
5498,ONE OF THE BEST DAMN GAMES I'VE PLAYED
5499,"This is a subpar but free hero shooter, try this if you are desperate. Team fortress 2 is way better, even Overwatch, fallen from grace as it is.

This game have the worse of abusive monetization of a free to play game. 
A focus on premium cosmetics than balancing or bug fixing. 
Abusive pricing structure that leads into lootboxes and multiple FOMO incentives.
Known bugs that has been in the game for years.
The SEA server was moved and resulted in everyone lagging for months.

The gameplay is fun, but it is not worth long-term investment."

I bought it with actual money so now these developers are removing paid content from the game, this is probably illegal, I don't recommend the game, they aren't able to balance characters, and removed a vital shop skill that gives heal block, now you can just run full heal teams and nothing can stop you."

Though after a while of playing it, something went wrong when trying to open it again. Restarting client and steam, reinstalling client and steam, restarting my computer and updating my computer all didn't make it work again. My computer is fine running other games from steam and on other sites that download games, also my computer ran it well prior to the issue. So i think the issue is on steam servers for this game. 

If this gets fixed, i would love to play it again"

I personally love this game because I love to play a Healer role; 
This game makes healers deadly if you use them probably, I absolutely love destroying flankers/damage as a healer and still be able to keep my team alive, it's truly invigorating.

I personally hate this game coz of da animes and the silly weeabooboos.

5563,"The gameplay is alright in comparison to other FPS-MOBA's, but has a nice share of bugs that have not (likely never will be) addressed. One of these bugs prevents players from starting the 64-bit version, forcing them to play the 32-bit by altering game files. No effective fix has been found that allows EVERYONE to play on steam. It's a decent game, but the only fix i've discovered is playing through epic launcher. Don't play this through steam if you're having trouble running this when you know it should."

After so many years this game is still very fun to play! It is not too hard not too easy. For everyone to play!

Even after a whole long break not so many toxic players are found! It is a good sign for me, yEaH. I love to see how the game still gets content like new champions! They are a bit expensive but you can play and earn coins/gold to buy them. No pay 2 win- on my eye sight at least. 

I love to play this game alone and with my friend bubu [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Flexus711/] @Flexus711 [/url]

U can definitely see that the game is made with love and passion and I love that."

5597,"always server bad server issue happen this game , nothing new"
5598,yes
5599,"""Guess who lost connection?"" - SLOGAN of EU SERVERS!!!

Paladins is a free to play Multiplayer FPS which might remind you of another game called ""Overwatch"". 
The game includes more than 50 champions divided into four different roles such as: Damage, Flank, Tank & Healer.
Each champion is played differently and I do believe that you can and will find a champion that you enjoy to play with.
Besides that there are a handful of maps and 3 different game modes you can choose from and play against real online players or against bots.
You also have the possibility to earn different cosmectics for your champions through finishing challenges or purchasing them.

Now why do I still not recommend playing this game? This question leads me to the technical status of the game. It's DISASTROUS!!!
First of all the EU servers are a joke!!! I have played this game for more than 700 hours now and it rarely happened that I did not loose my connection to the servers during a gaming session. It happened before the game started (champion selection), while I was loading in, in the middle of the game and even in the menu screen, If you play this game, stay away from the EU servers!
Every time I played a regular match and lost connection, I could load back in the game but if I played against bots there was no chance to come back to the game!
The next aspect would be the bad matchmaking system. The lobby gets mixed quite often, so well experienced players play with or against new players which leads to frustration. 

But the biggest issue I have witnessed is about to be described now: The Infinite Loading Screen Bug!
Whenever I am in the loading screen before a match starts,  the game might freeze and you only see the cards with the different champions on your screen and nothing happens. Or you get lucky enough to be thrown back to the menu screen, but you can't click on anything. Now why is it called the ""infinite"" bug? Players have reported that they have not been able to play for at least 90 mins. Imagine you want to have a fun time playing this game and due to this bug (which is well known for quite some time now) you are not able to play it for 90 mins. at least. That's something I have never experienced before and leads me to this bad rating of the game.
Instead of fixing these issues, the developers decided to realease new event passes every two months with a new champion and new cosmetics. Neither the bugs get fixed nor new maps or different game modes get added. 

My conclusion: If the developers do not start taking their game seriously and start fixing the game, I do believe many long time players (including me) will turn their back on this game in the long run! Instead of realeasing a new event pass every so often with new champions and cosmetics, start fixing those bugs! Paladins is my first game which technical status got worse and worse with every new release of a new event pass! I would be perfectly fine if there would not be any new content released due to working on those bugs. I will check it out later again, but for now I do not recommend playing it!

You can get a very solid experience out of this game without paying too much money (though I'd recommend getting the pack that unlocks all champions, as it saves you buying them individually over time).

5677,"it was very fun u get to use multiple different champions and have fun, during siege and other game modes u can have multiple very clutch moments the more u play the game the more comfortable u become with different characters making it a vast game with multiple things to do new characters to unlock new champions to fight and beat all the time. new characters are often added which keeps the game action packed the whole time. this game may not be for you but this game but i honestly suggest u try it, it is definitely worth your time"

5687,"My friend told me about this game called Paladins that he played everynight. I wanted to play it too so I looked it up on yahoo search and I came across a file called Paladins.exe on Mega Upload. I proceded to DL the exe and installed it. Thats when everything become odd....

My computer restarted but instead of the XP start up jingle I heard a blood curdiling screach,""AHHHHHHHHH!"",I nearly peed myself. But I assumed it was a glitch and opened Paladins. I was greeted by a russian man named Viktor who told me to stand infornt of my web cam,I did as he said.....that was my first mistake. I was now under his control.

He told me to take my shirt off and I did as he said next thing I knew he printed out the picture of me without my shirt and what looked like blood came on the screen. I went to turn of my computer but all that happend was a loud roar yelling,""YOU DAER CHALLUNGE MAKOA!"",and blood started oozing out the vents of my PC! I touched it and rubbed it on my face and it turned out to be kool aid,I was shocked! Then Viktors eyeys turned black and started leaking hyper realistic blood and he was luaghing like a mad man.

I unhooked all the cords from my PC and threw it in the trash outside but when I came back upstairs everything was set up again as if nothing had happend. I showed my mom the picture of me without my shirt and said I was hacked but then she said,""I'll hax ur xbox akount and ddos u!"",then she screamed as loud as she could and jumped out the window.

I can't get rid of my PC so I just keave it in my room but I never turn it on anymore. At night I wake up covered in kool aid and here the XP start up jingle with the bass boosted. I guess I should've bought Overwatch.

5705,"Please note my hours before reading.

Let me start off by saying I think paladins has the potential to be a great game, key word: potential. But all of that potential is clouded by bugs that have been in the games for years, changes to systems that didn't need to be changed in the first place (i.e. the new event pass system), and general lack of care from the developers. 

At the end of the day though, the game is free so it's up to you whether or not you want to play it, you'd be losing nothing by initially doing so. But investing time and more importantly, money, is something i do not recommend you do."
5706,in all honesty the game is pretty good and i played it for a bit but i sure as hell will recommend it although it all depends on your teammates if you're going to have fun or not because you can get complete morons or people that actually know how to play but other than that i like it

But don't worry, you have plenty of cosmetics to pick from. (if the game actually works and you get to give your kidney as a subsidy)

I never thought I would say this, but I'd rather play LoL.

Whoever is ""fixing"" this game, deserves that his mother doesn't love him.

Edit: They fixed some bugs and since I can't find a replacement for this goddamn game I'm back wasting my life on it again. Once you get good and learn all the roles and more champs, it's worse than a heroin addiction."

Pros:
1) Interesting characters + gameplay
2) Unique skins
3) Easy learning curve
4) Fun game with a group
5) So little ppl use VC and chat that it isn't super toxic (can be a con for ppl actively trying to communicate)

Cons:
1) IMO the skin system is really odd. I know it's a money thing for the company, but it doesn't seem fair.
2) Matchmaking is awful. It feels like 1/10 games I queue up for have people that aren't toxic and are around my level. The rest consist of people that are so much better than me that I have zero impact on the game, or people that have zero awareness of the game and int their butts off.
3) So many ppl that AFK. And zero punishment for it. 
4) Solo queuing is hell on Earth. Don't do it."

5824,"I think that the reason I like this game so much is that it is fun. Shooting things feels satisfying with almost every character, and the maps are interesting to play on. Something that can maybe rankle your experience is playing with people that are a higher level than you, but that's really a problem with multiplayer games in general. Overall, I think the game is fun."

5837,"Its a great balanced shooter with a great amount of customization.
Every hero feels smooth and different. 
The cards in the game are status buffs for your hero or its abilities.
Each hero is unique and their abilities are pretty fun for each.
You can swap between skins and weapon skins.
Mounts are fun and useful. They give an epic vibe when you go out the gate with your team.
The communication wheel feels a bit clunky but their are many hotkey capabilities.
The sprays and most cosmetics are hard to earn .
But the core game if cosmetics weren't an issue is fun. Real good fun. 
I played over watch since launch for years after getting more into Paladins the two games are so different in terms of strategy. In Over watch you tend to pick the right hero combos based on your skill for each role and ults. You switch heroes if you feel another is a necessity. On Paladins you cant switch your hero once a match begins. You can choose which buffs work best for your hero or class depending on the situation. 

I find my self getting real into a match with Androxus. Dashing through the air landing head shots while drifting in one direction. It gives this real invigorating heroic feeling. 

The game is fun balanced constantly updated and 2 new Heroes Oh and free"

I feel things can be pretty pricey, and the game is filled with quite a few bugs that don't seem to be worked on, and the balance can be questionable at times. But honestly? I still like it. I would recommend it for sure if you were like me when you found it, in a group of friends with no money and wanting to play a game together. By no means is it flawless, but man it is fun to sit down with your friends and play a fun, slightly buggy team focused game together. The biggest thing I would say to stay away from is ranked- toxic, and theres usually such a blatant meta."

5873,"I remember playing this expecting it to feel like a huge ripoff of Overwatch that was actually on Steam. Instead it actually turned out to feel pretty different from Overwatch. Not super different, but the same feeling that you get from playing two games in a similar genre that have few differences, but still do things a little differently. Personally I actually prefer this game to Overwatch even if I still think Overwatch is of better quality. The f2p system requires them to come out with consistent content so characters come out much more frequently than they do for something like Overwatch. That's good for content, but bad for balance. The more characters the harder it is to balance them all. I personally can't speak on that side of things as I don't play competitively nor look to deep into those sort of things. However I've had fun with a majority of the champions I've played in a casual setting and never felt like one was at the most 1.5x better than another one, but don't take my word for something like balancing.

If you want a free team based shooter similar to the likes of Overwatch this is definitely the best option if not one of the best. And hey it's free, might as well just give it a shot if it seems like something you'd be into."
5874,"Paladins on the surface seems to be the poor man's overwatch. Which it is. I don't hate nor do I like this game but I will still give my thoughts on it. Personally, as much as I do like the number of characters there are just WAY too many. I understand this makes some nice diversity but at the same time, this is more characters you also have to buy with either real or in-game currency. Not to mention a personal pet peeve of mine is how they model the women of the game with only 1 exception being a giant worm monster. You will see what I mean when you play it. However for a free game to play with friends yea it gets the job done genuinely. Something to do. But in my personal opinion if you want a free version of overwatch to play with friends just play Team Fortress 2. A lot more fully-fledged and a lot sillier too. All in all not a terrible game but just too many things pushing me away."
5875,not overwatch
5876,"definitely feel like hirez needs to add a system to fill leavers, seeing as my friends and I get 1-2 leaves in every match. 
Another issue are the bugs in the game. Why does the graphics rendering look like shit when i have a 6700? why do abilities seem to hit randomly (i dont know how many kills I got when I was holding the auto attack with my crosshair no where near people and yes, the kill feed said I got the kill)
I also wonder about 
I dunno, I hate Overwatch, but this doesn't feel like a casual replacement"
5877,the game is ass
5878,"This game was a pretty big part of my 9th grade year because every time we had time left after school with my friend or during launch break, we'd go to his house and play Paladins. 

It could run on a literal toaster, even his grandma's pc (a all in one 4gb Asus desktop) could run it well and that was enough

Now that I think of it it was just a few years ago and times goes so fast its scary


The game changed a lot since then and they added new champions and more, I'm not really into online games anymore, at least not like before where I could spend hours on them unless it's with friends because I really like sp games more now, but I'd recommend it still

Edit: 

I don't know how I didn't mention this since it isn't an insignificant thing but, the game's size is 70gb now because of the graphics upgrades likely and the adding of new content

It was less than 20gigs or less a few years back iirc

Edit : The game actually takes 30gb, Im confused considering I saw the installation prompt telling me that the game took 70, never mind"

5881,"For a free game this is more than enough. A lot of updates with patches, cosmetics or new heroes. Haven't met many cheaters which is surprising for a free game.
There are some balancing issues and bugs, matchmaking can be hell sometimes but overwall - would recommend.
If you are looking for a cool hero shooter then Paladins might be the right choice for you.

1 teaspoon ground ginger

1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

2 cups pumpkin purée from a sugar pumpkin (see Recipe Note) OR 1 (15-ounce can) pumpkin purée (can also use puréed cooked butternut squash)
1 1/2 cups heavy cream or 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
1 homemade pie crust, chilled or frozen (see pâte brisée recipe or our no-fail flaky pie crust recipe), or 2 pre-made pie shells

Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 425°F.
Make the filling:
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, spices — cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom, and lemon zest.
Mix in the pumpkin purée. Stir in the cream. Beat together until everything is well mixed.

Fill the pie shell and bake:
Pour the filling into an uncooked chilled or frozen pie shell. Bake at a high temperature of 425°F for 15 minutes.
Then after 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 350°F. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes more. The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly.
(About half-way through the baking, you may want to put foil around the edges or use a pie protector to keep the crust from getting too browned.)
Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up (from the leavening of the eggs), and will deflate as it cools.

5927,"I came to this game because two friends were playing it, which is already weird because it's not a thing I do usually, especially when it comes to ""competitive"" online games. Maybe the artstlye appealed to me idk. 

Anyways 2 weeks and 94 hours of playtime later and I can say I enjoy it. I'm not gonna kid myself the main reason I stayed is because I had a high level friend who helped me a lot when I started. but even then I still feel like the game is a bit more accessible than other competitve games, like don't get me wrong I'm not a good player but I have fun and I don't feel like I'm a deadweight for my team. Maybe it's because I'm still playing in my comfort zone in terms of champions and I haven't played ranked (probably never will), but it still keeps me entertained anyways. 

The current problems in the game that affected me are mostly from a technical standpoint : me and two of my friends had a game-breaking bug that required deleting a config file to fix, quite often a match just fails to load and boots me back to the main menu, you have some champion texture bugs depending on your graphical settings, refer a friend just doesn't work, and the bounty coin skin store is just a pain to look at. 

Also a quick tip I can give if you're planning on playing beyond a few games : Link a Hi-rez account, you can't get bounty coins without that and this currency is probably your best shot at getting some cool skins for free, even if it takes some time.

They definitely turned it around and I think now's the best time to get into it."

5997,"This game was a good copy of Blizzard Ent's OVERWATCH, BUT (yes, there is a big ""BUT"") - the servers are BAD and by ""BAD"" I mean REALLY BAD - regularly disconnection, slow entry into the matches and the worst - after I entered with my 30+ level Maeve, the game took me to the character selection lobby, after the timer expired it showed me the boot screen (everything seems fine) and... just kicked me in the main menu and crashed, and when I go to re-launch the server tries to re-connect me to the match and it's been 5 hours like that (many times re-launched the game), I manage to get to the main menu, but I can not click on anything - I'm just trapped into the endless loop of extremely poor server infrastructure. Let's not forget that as a ""FREE GAME"" you can expect that most players do not even have the slightest idea HOW to play their team role - there are not any healers or tanks - they all play ""jungle"" and tries to overfight the entire enemy team."

6047,"Terrible balance issues, not beginner friendly (many unexplained mechanics. Not only do I mean unexplained, there are mechanics that have 0 references inside the entire game anywhere to he found. You have to learn about them through word of mouth). Servers are OFTEN shit. Matchmaking is terrible. Ranked can take over an hour just to get into because of how many people will drop as soon as their main is picked or banned. Many players die once and then throw the rest of the game. 

The devs have no idea how to implement a new champion without it being absolutely broken. Uninspired, too, from what it used to be. Also, the majority of the community doesn't want new champs that don't fit the game and break balance and ruin peoples experiences. The majority of the community wants more maps, bug fixes, and maybe new content for existing champs. It took them YEARS to do anything useful to Torvald, and it boiled down to give him a 3 sec speed buff, but they'll release another high mobility edgy dark ninja that's ridiculously OP and difficult to deal with. Routinely they have trouble nerfing champs, too. Instead of nerfing the frustrating parts of dealing with a champ, like built in autoaim, they nerf what makes the champs actually fun to play as. Absolutely tone deaf, and it leads to a multitude of champs with only one viable play style/build, and a multitude of champs who are just garbage to play unless you're playing against new players in casuals. 

Overall, yeah I play the game a lot (steam says 686.7, but I only have 408 actual in match hours), and I'll probably still play it, but if you're considering downloading the game and starting as a new player, I'm warning you about a long term frustration. This is not a game you can pick up and play here and there casually and have a good time. You need to understand the kits and abilities of all the champs and how to at around them. Trying to play here and there casually will lead you to CONSTANTLY being obliterated and farmed. This is a minimum 50 hours invested before you can even grasp the mechanics that the game literally has 0 mention of anywhere in the interface/client/official media at all. And with investing that kind of time, you'll just end up frustrated. 

Stay away if you don't want to be routinely frustrated."

6071,"I have close to 3K playtime, I have a few of smurf which I used to play with my newbies friends (which also used my money to buy crystals for skins and to support the company), all accounts included, probably total to a 4K play times.

I used my hard earned cash to pay for skins in order to support Hirez...

but I don't feel appreciated at all playing this game.

The player base is great, fun and all, but Hirez team? Total BS..
No cauterize as shop item anymore? Then OP dps dont need to buy cauterize and can straight away buy items to make them even more OP... 

Crystals are also can hardly be obtained back from battlepass anymore. If you wants money, then why not just make a great skins that can only be obtained through paying with either crystals or money like fortnite? Huh? already done for a littttttle bit of skins and nobody gonna pay for it? well duh, then that's mean that skins suck and are worth no money...

This game not rewarding anymore, no crystal, always bad balancing every single update, lots of legit players got banned instead of obvious and well recorded cheaters.

The company itself hates it's own community and trying to kill it's own game slowly, so why bother playing anymore?

6080,Very nostalgic game!
6081,It was I bit fun for a while at least!
6082,"If you ever want to have the sensation of hitting people with a wet pool noodle, this is the game for you. This game might have some of the worst sound design I have seen, and it makes everything just feel off."
6083,"There are some of the same flaws you might expect to encounter with any team-based game that involves roles needing to fulfill certain functions. I see why people compare it to Overwatch, but it does not suffer from Lootbox syndrome, where the only way to get anything is through luck. It has a similar model to LOL in terms of unlocking new characters to use. But with the ability to try out any character in the training grounds and a constant cycle of characters being free to try out, I had no trouble finding the ones I like to play. Because each character can play significantly differently from the others, do not necessarily be discouraged from playing (and do not think you need to spend money on it to have any fun). Characters may be locked behind a gold paywall, but you can easily earn the in-game currency by just trying out the different characters available to you at the start and learning how it works. In one night of playing and figuring out what Paladins was really like, I already had enough coins to get the first character that I actually wanted to play. 

THE BEST THING about this game might be the lack of toxicity in the player base. I don't know if I just happened to join late enough in this game's shelf life that the toxic people have left, but there is a surprising lack of toxic interactions (at least from my experience so far). With any free-to-play online game, you would think it would come with the territory... a low cost of entry + a competitive model usually add up to a bunch of toxic players looking for a dopamine rush no matter the cost. While at times it feels like barely anyone even knows what they are doing in this game, at least it is not the complete cesspool of endless negative experiences that Overwatch has become. I am glad a friend of mine got me to try it out because so far it has been fun."

6130,"Almost a really good game. The heroes are well designed (for the most part), have a variety of play styles, maps are short but intricate, all leading to a very fun experience… on paper. 

Much like Hi-Rez’s other games, the community absolutely ruins whatever good ideas/designs are present. People will only pick damage/flank about 80-90% of the time, leaving non-ape brained players to either pick a healer or a tank… and only half the tanks/healers at that, since some are designed to be off-healers/off-tanks and as such aren’t very good as solo healers/tanks. To top it off, the spam picking damage players don’t have the common decency to be good. Most of the time they will charge headlong into the enemy team and die immediately or stand waaaay back and do nothing but take pot shots, if even that. Naturally this leads to getting out damaged by healers/tanks, which makes one wonder why they spam pick damage or flanks in the first place. 

Ranked isn’t any better, but for different reasons. For starters, it’s dead, expect to spend 8-10 minutes (sometimes longer) for every match, and then spend the entirety of the game in an argument with your tilted team mates. If they aren’t whining about not banning/playing X, they’re rage quitting because they FEEL someone isn’t doing well or just salty they’re not winning out the gate. 

TL:DR - it’s a Hi-Rez game. Great ideas and mechanics, absolutely terrible community."

I don't know which idiot on your dev team made that a thing but when my tank champion has somewhere in between 15 health bars and maybe adds 3-5 shield bars with an ability. I'll have to say  FU. This dudes' champion had my entire teams worth of health bars plus 10 with his shielding (at the start of the game), and did a normal amount of damage and stupid amount of stuns. After that experience your game is broken, or hacked. In either case I don't care to experience it again."
6139,"The game sometimes freezes for no reasons, especially when try to play ranked. tried many hours but will not wanna work but casual modes for fine and it fun to play with different heroes even though more different maps would be welcoming. and easier to get more golds, played this first time years and years ago. remember it was easier to grind than nowadays but anyway it just pure fun with some frustrations sometimes."

6156,Game is amazing and fun to play with friends
6157,"Been playing intermittently since closed beta. Used to be Master-- Ash main.
The game is STILL an unfinished and unoptimized mess.
It's as if the desktop version is a bad port from console version.
The way this game loads up textures and renders is so incredibly garbage.
Many bugs, especially to do with UI. Inconsistent art style for portraits and icons.
The skins are either extremely bland (just 1x hue change) or very over-the-top (character becomes a clown).
The game is pretty much unplayable with a latency above 150ms. (beware asian players)"
6158,its really just the servers
6159,"games shit now, don't play unless you wanna hate other people because this games playerbase is filled to the brim with the most idiotic people you'll ever have the misfortune of meeting, they'll lock in a flank characters despite the fact the team needed a tank, they'll rush the point without the team and get demolished, they'll leave and be replaced with the worst bots you've ever seen in a video game, its fucking unbearable sometimes. the devs are shit as well, they just pump out skins for degenerates at this point, there hasn't been a new map in forever nor have they worked on the god awful balance and matchmaking. avoid this game if you value your mental health."
6160,"Trying to play this on linux has become extremely frustrating since last week... Not only their anti-cheat is broken and kicks you out after a few seconds (when it used to work fine), but it also counts you as 'deserter'.

Come on devs, EAC is officially supported on linux/OSx and Proton! Do your job!

UPDATE: Could play again perfectly for 2-3 months this spring, and yet again in early July EAC kicks back and since then no way to play a single game... This is beyond frustrating. :((("
6161,"Great fps game, nice graphics and great team dynamics. Better than other ones I have played that were confusing and had difficult controls."
6162,gay
6163,do not play this game if you wish to retain your sanity.
6164,great game for quick fun anytime anywhere

6166,"This game has gotten worse and worse. Questionable changes, weird balancing (except for the last balance changes, they were superb) and a ton of infuriating glitches make the game near unplayable. The amount of character releases are great and all but some are really gitchy and unpolished. VII in my opinion is a mess of a character. His kit just doesn't make sense. Why give a flank a glitchy grappling hook if the other ability can only be used on the ground, Why does a flank have 
 a heavy smg with the ability to switch modes to deal damage on a far. I get that his sticky bomb is his burst ability. It's questionable tho considering the low range of the attack + his low health and sustainability. However there is a reason why most mode switching champs are dps, like Imani, Strix and I'll count Kinessa and Octavia too. Since they mostly attack from a far and deal damage periodically, unlike flanks usually short ranged burst. Also why make the hook be able to pull enemies, but also be able to attach yourself to walls. This means that if you miss your hook you might just fling yourself into the enemy, wich in my opinion is just stupid. This just makes me think if they ran out of ideas and is totally understandable considering the paste of new champion realeases, however I don't get why they focus on new champions when they could start polishing the game. It just doesn't make sense to keep shitting out new unfinished characters.

The release of azaan singlehandedly made me question the design philosophy of Hi-Rez. I don't know what they thought during the developement of Azaan. Whatever substance they were on, I want some. He had everything: infinite range, plenty damage, respectable CC, walls, CC immune movement ability that can fly across the map and also stun enemies for some reason, a massive healthpool with passive DR and a sustain higher than Raum's and get-out-of-jail free card ultimate. I get that balancing can be hard during the creation of a new champ, however I feel like he was made without a weakness in mind. In testing he was probably the strongest Champion to ever exist and when he came out he was nerfed a little, but still made normal games unplayable. Even after the hotfix he was still broken. And after he was finally nerfed the game could be played normally again, as he was not able to 1v5 or hunt down a single player while tanking the entire damage from the enemy team. As a cherry on top the hitbox of azaan was god-awful, as you could shoot through the arms and the head hitbox felt non-existant.

The game isn't dead and some rounds can still be enjoyable, however examples like never bringing back the play of the game because it caused some game breaking makes me lose hope in Hi-Rez Studios abilities to fix a problem. Especially when you realize, that this feature was removed years ago.

Please go ahead and play this game. It's free and worth the time. But looking back at all the weird decisions I can only give this game a thumbs down. What a shame."
6167,pretty good game and constant good new characters i like that
6168,Good soup
6169,"Paladins is that one friend you find really annoying and can only really stand their existence when you are with a few other friends. At times it can be  really fun to play but without a group of friends it can be really un motivating to play it by yourself. For me personally (im sure a few others in the community do this as well) it has gotten to a point where me and my friends only log on to do the in game challenges (trials of the realm) to get that sweet premium crystals  and then log off. I've just sort of lost that motivation for the game that I once had 2 years ago, back when you felt rewarded for when you played a few matches (cough cough back when the battle pass had over 100 rewards and at least 20-30 on the free track), now its just 30 or so rewards and only 2 skins plus 2 recolours of said skins. I am not saying its the worst game out there, hell its far from the worst game out there, its just lost the love (and most probably the funds  to add  that sweet sweet good content we all look for) put in from Hi-Rez and Evil Mojo jojo that drew me in the first time. And i can confidently say that with over 400 hours on this game that it is ok, its fun when playing with friends but boring as hell without them.     

Solid 7 out of 10 with friends, 6 out of 10 without"

6180,"Money greedy company that doesnt care about the player base. The only content they release is ""New"" champions which are all completely imbalanced and generic."
6181,shittiest buggy game ever made.
6182,Is pretty fun.
6183,"The game is good, but hi-rez is not"
6184,good alternative to overwatch
6185,This is a good game for free. dont have to pay jus download and have fun its better with friends but even alone will be fun.
6186,"Paladins is a free to play team-based hero shooter.
There are currently above 50 playable champions in the game and these are divided into 4 different classes: Front Line, Damage, Support and Flank. 
Paladins is free to play, so you just have a handful of champions at the beginning. The other champions you can unlock by playing a long time or by purchasing them.
For lovers of skins, there are alot of cosmetic items available for purchase...
Paladins features a card system. The card system can be described like this: ""Cards offer players the ability to empower Champions' attributes and enhance or modify their skills, tailoring them to a particular playstyle."" 
 (https://paladins.fandom.com/wiki/Cards)
There are different game modes like Siege (a round based game mode where each team works to earn Objective Points), Onslaught (players must earn tickets by either killing players or controlling a Capture Point), Team Deathmatch (the first team to achieve 40 kills wins) and a competetive mode.
If you consider to play competetive, I highly recommend to play it with friends. Playing with randoms can be very unsatisfying in terms of climbing up the rank ladder.
Paladins can be fun if you play it with friends. I recommend to give it a try if you like hero shooters and have someone to play with.

6190,"I bought the Paladins Founder's Pack way back when the game came out and I enjoyed it but it had its drawbacks and I found myself playing Overwatch much more than Paladins. But with all the new heroes and the huge changes the game has gone through in the years since, I've recently come back to it and found that it's by far my favorite team shooter.

There are heroes for all different kinds of play styles and most heroes can adapt via the in-match loadouts and purchases to the situations that come up. (No tank? Pick up some extra HP and damage reduction since you'll likely be taking more damage, etc.)

I know the game systems have changed so that free-to-play players can't feasibly get all the heroes unlocked anymore so I can't recommend it for them, but for anyone who just buys the hero pack with all current heroes, it's a really great game with a lot of depth and a ton of fun with friends."
6191,"Pretty fun, at least its not dead like OW."
6192,"great experience and amazing characters, needs more maps tho"

6206,"This game is very easy to learn and fun to play with your friends and by yourself, although i think this game would thrive with a story mode/campaign i feel as if this game lacks lore or much story, so maybe a show or something but i think the game would thrive with those additions"
6207,Yes
6208,good game
6209,"This game is an absolute masterpiece. I love it and recommend it for pretty much anyone, whether you are a csgo veteran or an autochess enjoyer. The gameplay is smooth, the community is great as well. Also, it's really sentimental for me too, because I first played this game 5 years ago and have lots of great memories with my friends and classmates. The biggest downside of the game is that developers are trying to convince us, players, to buy passes, skins and etc.
Overall, I think this game is great 10/10 and everyone should try it out."
6210,better overwatch
6211,"Game is completely fucked almost everything is just really dumb like

Horses they are not helpful they hurt the game (cause players to run in head first)

Maps are either way too big or way too small

Every character has abilities that either don't combo with their other abilities or they just have an ability another character already has.

this game is not a competitive game but it does succeed where overwatch failed and that the porn, almost every character is overly sexualized or massively buff. They clearly don't care about anything else and the rule 34 shows it"
6212,What Points For New Event/Collab If Server (F) Rip? Fix damn server please...
6213,yes
6214,"Looks a lot like overwatch but free. I think it's a a very fun game, but it's more fun with friends."
6215,"I will leave this short and sweet.

Insane amount of bugs..ALWAYS.

Dev team focuses on pumping out characters and skins rather than balancing. This led to there being a shit ton of characters but a handful of them just aren't viable.

Ranked is a pain, people don't like to fill. On other hand, too low player count for class based queue like League.

6216,They must have recently added a new paladin that has some sort of ability that causes a constant beeping sound...Super annoying. /Quit

Graphics aside, each match is fun, short and the variety in heroes makes for really interesting games every time."
6224,good but bad

But I'll always eventually come back to this. It's just so fun and I don't mind the in game graphics being so pixelized(?) since it is free though I would appreciate if they worked on that. Rarely ever come across bugs or maybe I just didn't pay attention. Overall I personally love this game!"
6244,Tooooooooo easy
6245,ew
6246,m
6247,if you are on EU servers the game will not work as you will disconnect from the server whilst loading in. the people in charge of the servers do not care if you are on EU servers so go and play something like overwatch because its basically the same game with less pointless updates.
6248,"very unpolished game and the matchmaking gives priority t speed over quality, unbalanced as hell and instead of reworking/balancing champions the devs are more focused on realisisng new ones, the in-game communication sucks and is counter intuitive at best but the variety of gamemodes is at least an upside of whis game"
6249,"An amazing hero shooter with fun and unique characters, a surprising amount of depth, and well balanced game mode. And with the continued support through new characters and customisation items, I don't see this dying any time soon."

Started getting constant framerate stuttering out of the blue.

it has nothing to do with my cpu or gpu.

shame.


[edit]
Also this game has so many leavers it's ridiculous. Every second game."
6255,Good game
6256,"Kinda fun to try the champions, but too many gameplay issues.

About 75% of your games will have someone leave and be replaced by a bot barely capable of walking onto the point to feed ult charge to the enemy team, much less actually helping to replace the leaver.

About 1/3 of your games will have intense rubber-banding issues - good luck playing any of the characters who rely on dashes for movement, when dashing means flying forward, stuttering back, then finally flying forward again.

Ability animations often lock you into them really hard, so a number of the characters that should feel fluid instead feel terrible as you desperately spam an ability but die while your character finishes the flourish at the end of the previous ability.

It's fun for a bit if you've gotten bored of Overwatch, but you'll notice the lack of polish pretty badly after the novelty wears off."
6257,"NICE

6258,Full of AI bots.

6260,What is the point of purchasing skins when you cant even play in 3rd person view?
6261,Healers win games
6262,there's no way you can maintain a balanced game with 60+ characters (and counting) and a screwed matchmaker. Every match on casual is either stomp or get stomped
6263,funny spellcaster bnuy and angry rock man go brrr
6264,way easier to pick up than overwatch
6265,"This game is very fun like Overwatch, with more ways to customize your play style, and more characters.

What I hate is how snaggy the levels are. The level's ""hitboxes"" are too large and always stop you from gliding around like a platformer king. You cannot easily slide along walls or make tight jumps or anything, all the edges and corners of polygons and walls in the level are not rounded off and will snag the hell out of you like being rooted. It feels nothing like Quake or Half-Life engine. I wish they would fix this.

We are way beyond the point, where making excuses for the development studio, sounds like a pathetic joke. This game problems need to be adresed by the core, both techical and gameplay wise. The gameplay in general is extremly frustrating, unfun, and unberebly not thought through. The last thing this game needs, it's shi** out new champion every patch, with minimal thought that went into balance and gameplay. I regret every hour that I put into this garbage and would recommend it to nobody."

6331,"I dont recommend this game for one simple reason. Its community. It seems no matter how old this game gets, its playerbase still dont understand the basic concept of needing a tank/healer to actually win games.

They keep going 4 damage dealers because shooting is fun. What this game needs to get more than 10k concurrent players is to add a Role-selector when you queue up, so you get queued with atleast 1 healer, 1 frontline every match.
I main frontline and healer, and it sucks being a healer to 4 squishy cookies who almost never outdamage the enemies frontliners anyway OR frontline in a team without a healer. The last couple of years ive only been able to play a handfull of matches before uninstalling it again due to the annoyance it brings me. This game does not feel fun to play, it feels annoying and obnoxious and thats due to people not knowing how to pick."

6339,good game but dont play it
6340,its ok
6341,Fun game
6342,fun
6343,best game
6344,Good game
6345,every update comes with a bunch of new issues which most of never gets fixed
6346,used to think its a rip off of overwatch but now it is better
6347,"I remember before i had an IQ that was higher than the amount of letters in ""your mom lol"" that i used to say that this game was shitty. Just a 'poor man's overwatch!' When i do not really think thats the case anymore. Of course, i do think that overwatch in some regards will be better than paladins. Of course, since overwatch is dying fairly quickly and OW2 is close on its release, this game will get more traction. So, lets get into it.


The characters are..... good. I know you expected me to say this game was garbage, but it isnt. Instead, i think that each champion isnt the worst thing to ever grace this earth. But it suffers from overchoice. When you have so many champions to use, why use anything besides the meta for that major problem? Why use lex to mow down that stupid kinessa sniping my fernando when i can snipe them with Androxus? Why use really any shield character when barik has such good defensive and offefnsive capabilties he is just... good? You get the idea. Mostly fun characters, but too many characters.


The maps are uh... certainly maps.


The community and developers are questionable, to say the least. People say that this game is just a cash grab, and while i can certainly see why (the grind is fuckin horrid), i do think that the developers do at least kind of care. About making a good character, balance wise, its fair game. The community is either furry incels,  chill people, or assholes. Every community has assholes and judges the game based on those assholes, but people should judge the community based on how many times you see assholes. I used assholes a lot in that sentence. In regards to that? Meh, i'd say its funny when a player is just confused when a yagorath rolls up,  pops there ultimate on you, then rolls away.


Overall? Not the worst class shooter you could get, but just fuckin play tf2."
6348,Koga bad
6349,"I went in thinking it would just be a stupid overwatch clone, left and was actually suprised. Its actually really fun and not just an overwatch rip-off. Fun characters to play and the deck sysytem makes things even more interesting."
6350,"Before I played this, I had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
6351,"It's alright, I guess."
6352,is great
6353,"Ah yes, A mystical creature of old folk tales, Let's give them a gun"
6354,ok
6355,it's cool
6356,really fun 5v5
6357,"Graphic and character UI is pretty bad. Even if the character is supposed to be looking good if you mingle around with the setting, I think the game should set the graphic to the best graphic initially and then players can change the setting as per their own preference."
6358,paladins
6359,.
6360,fuck skye
6361,"We fucking had a match and somehow we got 3 3 at the end of the game and the last second of push when everyone was dead and it kicked us from the game like wtf are u fucking retarded or u doint have ears and eyes game is here from 2017 and u dont know how to fix fucking bugs bro it triggers every single player and that is why you are losing players,main thing is that u add new cahmpion skinns and not fixking bugs.Only game that i really enjoy to play but i fucking can t beacause of stupid bugs and retareded pathetic champions."
6362,Good until the dev team abandoned it. Now just another title they never loved enough

6365,"Never played overwatch, which might be better I guess, but this is a fun game anyway."
6366,"Schism update feels like its thrown a lot of things out of balance. Gameplay is about the same, but for some reason people have dropped 50 iq points since Schism released."

6368,so true bestie
6369,"Paladins is just like life, everyone using their abilities and being bad at it. Yes you too. Everything is changing and you don't know how to cope with it. And the most infuriating part, some high pitch screamer kid pobably asian, will outskill you everyway. Now that I say it, why aren't you good at this game? 6/9 recommended."
6370,"yes
"
6371,kanye west
6372,"The latest changes have dramatically altered the feel of the game. I enjoyed playing the game regularly, but with the recent updates, and most notably the change to Cauterize, the entire game feels different. In a bad way. 

I likely won't be playing again."
6373,only old horny people play this game plus theres furrys and its just overwatch.
6374,"Decide to play ranked.

First two placement ranked games go fine.

Third, we choose our heroes and then game repeatedly gets stuck on loading screens, booting me back to the main menu where I can't interact with anything.

Game completely broken, can't do anything, can't play the game, presumebly lost the ranked match because of the client bugging out, broken.

Game's a buggy mess."
6375,bad
6376,it's not amazing but it's good enough at least to play casual with friends.

6385,"Even tho this game is mostly dead I find enjoyment out of it, coming into it as a poor mans overwatch and staying for the uniquness and surprising customization of characters. Overwatch is very simple, pick character play game, pick different character to fight other character. Paladins had you choose one character and choose how you will play that game to defend against that character."
6386,fun overwatch copy
6387,degenerate game. no reccomend to people that are not degenerate
6388,Good game
6389,It was good but then they removed play of the game
6390,"great game
"
6391,i main the guy with the cool fire sword i have no idea why but he reminds me of jetstream sam from metal gear rising revengence this game is awsome i recomend this game
6392,"takes too long to accrue gold to purchase champions, purchased one champ released early in the game's lifecycle and can't afford a recent release after 11 hours of play. rate to purchase crystals is a joke. power creep of f2p units versus new ones is also a joke. client is extremely buggy (can't redeem codes, sometimes game shows no feedback from input, loading menus lock up, ect), game modes get rather stale. additional missions you can complete for crystals and bonuses, from the get go, use champs you have to purchase so you're stuck in a catch 22 of playing who you don't want and buying them just to progress. just a scammy business model that hasn't respected the game's ""growth""

so much potential game has sorta just been left for dead besides people paying for champions and battle passes"
6393,183hr gg game
6394,"Played on/off for a long time on Xbox/crossplay. I honestly preferred it and it's maps to Overwatch. As with all small team-tactical games you'll likely find yourself hard carrying feeders regularly. With a few mates it's quite a fun game, and the ability to customise your loadouts to your liking for each character really shines for good players."
6395,fun game

6399,corvus is hot

6412,"Even tho Paladins isn't really relevant anymore and I haven't played this game since 2018. but if your looking for a free to play game or too poor to buy overwatch, this game could fit your style"
6413,"This game had incredible potential only ruined by the pure raw talent of the developers not giving this game the polish it deserved, played for over 1000+ hours on switch since 2018, but the game is unplayable there now due to how bedridden with bad servers and bugs the game has on that platform, Hi-Rez keeps releasing new champions in hopes people don't play the old, bug-filled ones, characters like Vora and Azaan are just overtuned in release while some old ones like Khan, Koga, Androxus and many others are still filled with bugs, it's actually incredible Hi-Rez is giving money to AmaLee, Vtubers and other figures to promote this game when it's actually unplayable at certain times, this game could have been by far the best of it's kind but it was ruined by the sheer power of inaptitude and stupidity, if you're willing to deal with bugs that are sometimes game breaking, terrible/afk teammates (a lot of time because the game just crashes on people mid game) then MAAAAYBE, just MAYYYYBE you have something worth looking at here, Hi-Rez is never fixing the things that make this game so troublesome to play so don't go in expecting something better for the future because it's been 4 years and many bugs are STILL the same, the player numbers keep declining, you can only enjoy what's left of the lifespan of this game, which I believe is worth some trouble but I would never get any of my friends to play a bed-ridden game"
6414,this version of overwatch is fun
6415,so fun kinda like overwhach but better abyletis
6416,super fun when not taken competitively
6417,"Like overwatch, but you can actually enjoy the game.."

6426,Better than OW imo. I enjoy this one a lot more and there seems to be more depth to the game.
6427,"This game is so ass. Honestly if they delete Zhin from the whole game it would actually be playable. Toxic shitters, broken champs, and zhin is the reason no one should play this game. If they just deleted Zhin the game would maybe be playable, but a dps that can deflect, not take any damge, and then full heal in 3 seconds is brain dead. Don't even start playing this game and save yourself the headache from toxic teammates and Hi-Rez not wanting to balance their game. It's whoever follows the meta and has zhin on their team just wins."
6428,"Great multiplayer game, worth trying out if you like messing with character builds and alternative ways to play the game."
6429,its very fun tbh and pretty easy to lvl and have fun with friends
6430,Good

6432,Good game

6436,The game you play when you're tired of Team Fortress and mad at Overwatch.
6437,it's fun alright
6438,"Bugz. Staring a match. It not delivers, some bug with matchmaking, so it comes back to the screen when all heroes are selected for the same match. Hangs on at this screen forever. When You will force exit by Windows and run the game again - it tries to connect to the same match, but this is not possible, so goes back to login screen and to the main screen of the game.  On this screen it will not allow to interact in any way with any option (mouse or keyboard, it does not work). You can force exit once again and it's the same issue in circle. This issue lasts about two hours, then You can play. 

I have over 1000 hours in this game. Many bugs, many unbalanced tragic. But this time, with this bug, I am unistalling it and will forget about it forever. Good luck :)"
6439,Great job guys. Keep updating and I'll be there to see what's new :D
6440,"Doesn't feel balanced at all - tanks aren't tanks, everyone is squishy, damage is off the charts even if you're a support and matches are over in 2 minutes or less. Terrible game, not sure how it's still running."
6441,pretty fun game
6442,literally god tier game idc what anyone says
6443,lutd
6444,Dog shit game. There are a lot of bugs. When I get a reward at the end of a match it just gets stuck in a loop and I have to close the game. I have also went into a match and got thrown back into the champ select and the game just stopped working. If you're going to rip off a game at least make it work

With all the ups and downs I have to say its still my most played game and I really enjoy playing Paladins. I don't see myself giving up until they do. I 100% recommend Paladins but would tell new players to practice on bots for a bit and not to even try ranked until you can comfortably play at least 2 of each Champion type."

6458,its cool

6461,"Honestly, I love this game and I hate it in the same time.

Concept, playstyle, champions, I love it. It is really one of the best free to play game. And it is so much fun for casual playing. When you are on high elo, you start to see so many flaws.

What is sad about this game are bugs, like many bugs and not properly working anticheat system and ticket system. And of course no Esport.

But it is worth a try.

6469,Been playing since beta. Encountered so many bugs during overall playthrough but in the end I still come back to this. Still enjoying the game. Though I only play just for fun. Never played on Rank cause don't wanna get to involved and ends up stressing myself out. Characters are great. Nowadays only been using Seris. Love her hsahsh.
6470,great game
6471,wow!
6472,"Yeah this game may not be as polished as Overwatch. But at least it stays fresh. Better champions to play, better skins, and overall a more enjoyable experience when it comes to rank and matching similarly skilled players. I'm starting on PC. about level 28 now. I'm level 157 on playstation. That alone shows how much I enjoy this game. And most of all it's completely FREE!! What's better than free? You tell me haha. Of course the amazing cosmetics keeps me spending money on this game, and I don't regret it one bit. Please download it and join the community. We would be happy to have you!!"

6475,very jes jahome
6476,"One game type dominates the others and the limited number of maps paired with the short playtime per game will have you cycle through them pretty fast. End result that the game becomes too samey too quick.
Might have played a bit more just to try out the different heroes, but even with the large amount of characters you soon realise that each team will pick Skye and the main experience becomes getting killed by an invisible rapid fire that kills any non-tank faster than they can react."

The cosmetics can be hell to grind for but aren't a necessity for enjoyment if you don't play consistently. Overall, I'd recommend to anyone who wants a game to kill time or to play with friends. Better than overwatch. Plus it's free, only thing it costs is time."
6514,the game very cool
6515,tbh my favourite part of this game is koga and the female characters boobs and ass. this game makes me wanna jump off a bridge every time i get one tapped. everytime i wait in the lobby for my friends i casually inspect each girl characters ass and see which one has the most ''bunda'' and ''boobs''. makes me wonder why i have 38hrs on this game all tho i will get more hrs on it. this game sometime maybe good sometime sheit. also nerf azaan. broken champ. if your new to the game play vii or koga...maybe azaan if your feeling cheeky

6525,"[b] [h1] [i] ""No one's over-powered, because everyone's overpowered"" [/i] [/h1] [/b]

In the words of The Incredibles' Syndrome: ""If everyone's super, no one will be,"" and i find that to be quite fitting for Paladins. From the Hero's i've played (That's 3 in total... yeah) your abilities seem so brokenly overpowered on paper... [i] and [/i] in practice. Heals your whole team 1000 hp each, with a 6-second cool-down? Sure. Place down two ultimate flame-thrower turrets at once? Done. Push the entire enemy team far enough to make them fall off the map? Simple.   

[h2] Features that i like: [/h2]

Legend rotation: 
Every week (i'd assume that, only played for 2 days), several legends are playable for free. This makes trying out legends in combat possible, which makes the game so much fun. Bored of your legends but can't afford to farm a few hours to get a new one? Bam, we've got you covered. I don't know why other hero shooters don't have this, it's such a pivotal mechanic. It's like a free trial for a legend, which will increase sales and user enjoyment at the same time. 

What else... I don't know yet. I'll have to play more to find out, and'll update this review when i find stuff. 

Anyway, i'm off to have more fun in Paladins. Gl, HF my friends."
6526,"I’ve been playing this game for years on various systems and just decided to get back in. I’ve enjoyed the depth of strategy that is possible in point focused games like this and overwatch. One thing I was disappointed with is that there was no way to link my console account to this account, something that would have been nice, as now I have to unlock champions again. Overall this game is still a positive experience and has a lot of really cool unique mechanics that allow you to change your playstyle."

6528,oh no our server it's broken
6529,"Its fun for like a week, then you uninstall it."
6530,Im saying yes because i like the game BUT i cant even play  it anymore because of error 10011. I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING and NOTHING works.

6536,amazing game my favorite plz get it
6537,"i cant even play the game. I tried connecting my controller and it would make it seem like i have joystick drift and the bottons dont match the screen. I cant use the keyboard either, this game is trash"
6538,i love it
6539,"The matchmaking is broken. Completely. Don't listen to me though, google it. Lol. I wanted to experience it myself just to verify it. 100% true."
6540,pretty good time for f2p

6553,"Quite fun for passing time, the community is quite alright, for sure not as toxic as in other games, game-play can be fun or dull, depends on how much time you'll invest in to exploring different play-styles, cards and talents for champions. Currently writing this review because the game is crashing though xDDDDD"
6554,Great game just not right now because ALL THEY DO IS ADD CHAMPS AND DON'T FIX THE F*@!ING BUGS!

6559,Everything is good!
6560,This game is overwatch from Wish.
6561,If you don't wanna buy overwatch or don't like overwatch and dont care that this game is dead its a good game. Just like any ranked game you can improve and enjoy the ranked experience. You can try to get top 100 on leaderboards for a low played character like me and its pretty fun.
6562,"it crashes like every fucking 2 seconds and i know its not my pc or wifi, its and average game but like cmon do better"
6563,I really enjoy the game more so than its competitor overwatch even though it's god some serious bugs that need fixing
6564,fun free yes
6565,"I feel like when someone is last to pick their champion, the system should auto select what champ we are missing. So we don't have a bunch of Flanks and no tank or healer for example."

flank,flanks that tank,healers that play and do more damage and kills and damage who snipe with a non sniping character its like do ya even play your own game its possible but not worth the mental stress."

6577,"It was an amazing game at first, spent an entire week playing it basically nonstop with my boyfriend. All of a sudden after I spent $10.00 on the game, it does some reverse card and stops launching on Steam. 
Highly don't recommend at all anymore. Haven't even played the update yet because it won't let me but I'm glad I didn't by the discussions everyone is having over the glitches. 

Just don't even bother, save yourself the trouble and avoid this fucking glitchy mess of a game."
6578,It's buggy as shit and now they suck at making skins now with RWBY skins comming straight from SMITE. Avoid at all cost
6579,<3
6580,"it is not too bad but it needs a chage
"
6581,Free to play Overwatch clone.
6582,"The game itself is pretty fun but the current state of the game servers is a complete mess.... Until the servers are fixed I can't recommend this game to anyone.
3 out of 10 matches don't even start because it gets stuck on ""Launching"" and 50% of the time you lose your game anyways because of horrible lag. (Failed pushes/objective captures while someone is clearly standing on the objective but the server doesn't register it etc.)"
6583,"INCREDIBLE SHIT, CANT EVEN FIX LOADING BUGS. BULLSHIT. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. TRUST ME. U WILL REGRET DOWNLOADING THIS D0G SHIT"

6585,This game is one big bug.
6586,no
6587,"This game is IN a dead state, some new heroes pop up WITH skin chests and that's it!! I there is a bug where U select go on a loading screen then u're back to select screen and u're done for the day because the game just dies!! U can restart, wait, anything, it will not work for a time, try next day maybe U can play 2-3 games until it comes back. AND THIS is for months now, don't even think playing ranked because from 10 games 9 U or enemy will have AFK because of this. Bugadins the name U should not play. 

(this the most annoying bug but there's 100s more)"
6588,"more bugs, but i enjoy this game"

6594,Overwatch knockoff.
6595,I really recommend this game!
6596,The game has critical bugs... the menu gets blocked and you can't do anything extremely often... You get in a ranked match the game glitches before you start battle... you need to quit... when you try to get in again it doesn't put you in the game... instead it shows you the frozen menu window and you can't do nothing... This is a fabulous concept of a game and I enjoyed over the years... but unfortunately a very incompetent team behind it.
6597,nice game
6598,.
6599,su casa
6600,its nice
6601,"good game to just chill way better then Overwatch less sweat too. I would recommend for people that don't like how sweaty and over hype Overwatch was. Now obviously this game has balance issues but it is constantly updated and its free to play. Gold grind is a little annoying and lootboxes are annoying but if you don't care about skins this isn't a problem. Do wish they would add a thing where you can just buy the skins you want instead of doing the chests, even if they skins were slightly more then the chest costs. With that being said there are ways to get diamonds in game over time so you can still get the good skins here and there."
6602,"Paladins? What about the warriors, rogues and warlocks?"
6603,off brand overwatch but holy smokes they got some nice ass-ets and physics. i recommend if ur poor and cant afford overwatch.
6604,I would rather die than play another match
6605,v cool
6606,A fun alternative to Overwatch. I like how you can customize the loadouts/cards to suit the way you play.
6607,"First, this business model is horrible. The game is set to charge a player as much as they can get away with. Pay for characters, pay for subpar skins, pay for passes, pay for chests. They even charge you to send a gift to your friends-its like double taxation...just horrible.

Second, the characters are all stolen from far better MOAB's. Their abilities, many of the skins (add horns, add claws, change the wings). Willofor example is Willow from DOTA with mixed up abilities and the same concept. Just the laziest plagiarism that somehow is allowed because its a wee-bit different so you can't say its the same.

Third and most importantly, the game is boring. Quick matches, boring maps, simple champions with simple abilities and simple objectives. Its a young child's version of a competitive game made for the lowest tier player.

Play DOTA if you want a well balanced MOAB that doesn't suck the money out of your pocket."
6608,"Cool game, I used to play It a lot.

I did quit a year ago because of the game breaking bugs and crashes, leaving matches with bots or just and endless loading screen, even after completely shutting down Paladins/Steam. Some cases even after uninstalling (I've heard).

Recently got back thinking they must have fixed it by now. No, I'd say it's even worse now, I tried 10 games to qualify for ranked, only one counted and it was a loss, I wasn't even in that game. But sometimes the game works perfectly fine, until it's ruined by unfair game matches or one shot auto target ultimate.

If you've never played Paladins, go play it. It's much more fun with a pre-made team and there's tons of cool champions, but you will at some point ragequit, I guarantee."

6618,good game would recomend
6619,"I'd recommend Paladins for anyone who wants a unique Hero shooter to jump in casually and play. It feels good, looks good, and sounds good. The comparisons to Overwatch are accurate, no one can deny that. In my limited experience, Paladins feels a [i] bit [/i] more based on gunplay than ability synergy and relying on ally setups and combos - but I could be wrong there.

I've not played anything competitive or high-level, but as a casual player - this scratches that hero shooting itch, and games seem to queue up relatively fast and painlessly."
6620,"very good game
"
6621,very cool game its not exactly pay to win since you can unlock all the characters without buying them and most of them are balanced
6622,Raum go brrrr
6623,"Teammates are usually brainless, the ranked system is horrible, but it's still worth trying. Me and some friends had a good 44 hours a playtime before we go bored"
6624,ok
6625,Love this game.
6626,"Like Overwatch, but fun.

Pros:
-every character has 3 basic abilities (plus ult), with greater depth/synergy on average
-just straight up better map design (low bar I know)
-character picks are lock-in, so no counter pick hot potato mini-games
-receives regular updates (lol)
-tanks that are fun to play
-healing reduced during combat - sustain is still powerful but not oppressive
-symmetrical game mode, very little attack/defence disparity in the character design
-free to play, and you can just buy the champion pack to auto-unlock all the characters if grinding freemium currency isn't your thing

Cons:
-the game be kinda (really) jank sometimes
-UI options are minimal
-people will judge you for playing ""that budget OW clone by the developer that ruined Tribes"""
6627,its meh
6628,Great game.

6631,If you want to ruin your friend's day invite them to play paladins.
6632,"the game is honestly very frustrating, Soooo often i will just die in one second, completely nuked in 2 shots from a flanker, so much rage, but i cant stop playing it, i am only good with super noob champions, and i am terrible with anything else. it is like a moba mixed into an arena shooter, and the matchmaking can suck, you will get so many terrible teams and complete carry enemies. often go on like 15 game losing streaks and its very demoralizing. but i cant stop playing. sometimes you feel like you just had an amazing game but your stats show the same as when you felt like you didnt do anything except die a bunch. it takes a long time to get even remotely good at enemies. how is it that i jump out and shoot the guy right in the face with like 15 shots and they turn around and can kill me in less than 1 second? i suck at this game and find myself rage quitting quite often, then trying to play something else...then gettin back on....i cant stop playing"
6633,95% of players are terrible. The other 5% is the enemy team

6657,"Many say that Paladins is just a OW wannabe but I don't see that. 
First, Paladins was made before OW... It's gameplay is also different from OW. 
I enjoy BOTH GAMES.

Paladins is just overall fun gameplay that can get pretty tryhard at times.

6670,6/10 If you wanna battle it out in the comments you are more than welcome to.
6671,Good game but trash matchmake
6672,"At first glance I thought this was just an OW clone, but it's really not.

The characters are customizable with card decks/mods, you can choose between 3 different ""talent builds"" so every single character can be played several different ways!
The graphics reminds me a lot of Spyro Reignited which is wonderful in my opinion.
It does force you to play against bots for the first 5 lvls of your account (both characters and your account gain lvls) but that makes sense since it let's you learn the game a little before you try against other players.

It is a free-to-play game so they have to make their money somehow, you do have to unlock characters, but you can also do this by simply playing the game and earning gold to purchase characters with and it's not really all that much of a grind to get the gold needed and the matches aren't that long.
There is a free weekly rotation of characters you can play for free.

It does offer a Starter Bundle in the shop that unlocks several characters and gives you a good deal of Gold which you can use to unlock even more characters. The bundle is only 5$.

It gives you Gold and XP bonus if you play with people from your friendlist, so bring your friends along for some fun!

You don't have to pay anything to enjoy this game!"

6700,"Can't go wrong with Paladins. I personally don't like the whole ""loot crate skin chest"" system, but otherwise the gameplay is pretty fun. I usually do Onslaught practice with friends, or Public Casual. Tons of enjoyable characters to try out across all classes. Give it a go if you enjoy games like TF2, Overwatch, or Valorant. 
8/10"
6701,"funny fun game go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
"
6702,"For who knows how long there's this bug that freezes your game as the match loads. Not only it screws your game, it also screws the game of 9 other people, as they have to play with a bot. Meanwhile the devs are pumping new champions and low-effort skins through battle-passes, ignoring bugs and long-standing player gripes. Lag is a perennial complaint.

It's a shame, as Paladins really had some unique takes on the genre, and definitely had the potential. But devs no longer have the mojo, and the players see the downfall, as evidently seen in the declining playerbase. Many of middle-core gamers have left. Most of who remain are fresh blood that you cannot really count on for teamwork and good game, and hardcore tryhards. Very poor matchmaking will make sure you'll often have unfun combinations of these through your and enemy team.

I'm kinda sad to wave goodbye to Paladins, after half a decade and three thousand hours sunk. But it's time to move on. I could accept the roulette of ""will your team get stomped, or will the enemy team"". But I don't want to play roulette ""will you get to play, or will the game lock for a few hours and you'll straddle the team with a bot"".

I may occasionally jump in and see how it goes... But my heart is no longer with Paladins. I've spent much more cash here than a standard triple-A game costs, and would have likely spent as much in the future. I got that latest battle pass for cringe anime girl skin (yep, cringe, not cute, and this comes from someone liking anime girl skins). But devs should've rather worked on fixing the game. By choosing another battle pass sale over having a quality game, they deserve neither and will lose both."

The community is hands down the worst I have ever experienced. The cesspool of toxicity, behaviour and overall mentality of the players within this game is disgusting. 
IF you can stomach that, of which I think you'll be surprised how BAD it is, you might have fun.

6743,"I don't really do reviews for games but I just had to do one for this game. As much as I enjoy it I can't recommend it to anyone, the community is unbelievably toxic, especially if you're new to the game like me. Every game you have someone flaming one person on their team over seemingly nothing. I mean, just look at the screenshots I had for this game, I literally just asked the guy why he went Buck with 2 seconds left when we needed a frontline and he and his friend decided to just spam flame me all game. Honestly, I really do enjoy the game but the community ruins it and the Devs don't give 2 fucks about it. Also AFKing is rampant, it feels like every other game you have someone afk and there's 0 repercussions for it. I really don't understand how there is no Surrender option after this game has been out for so long? Doesn't feel good playing a 3/4v5 when the enemy just sits outside your spawn for 15 minutes. The Matchmaking is also pretty bad, you can have a bunch of level 10s on your team against people with level 100 champs? How is that balanced?"
6744,Just play the game.
6745,yes
6746,kekw
6747,"W.I.P

I'm one of those people that wishes I could give a ""middle thumb"" instead of up or down.

Great game and even better for those who gave up on Overwatch and/or if you are really into amazing waifus (!), but the devs are doing little to solve the numerous bugs, crash issues, and rubber banding lag.

They also have some sort of f#tish with ""exclusive"" content. There's hundreds of fantastic, sexy, funny, and bad a## skins (hellooo Sun Kissed Cassie!!), but roughly 80% of the content is vintage; its there for a month or so, and gone forever. 

This doesn't work at all. 

Their sales are limited, and new comers miss out on a lot of good stuff. ""Let's spend numerous man-hours to create skins and NOT sell them"" isn't good business practices, either.  No one wins in this system. I was hoping that more folks learned stuff like this from Overwatch's mistake. ""You want that skin? Spend $100's  on loot boxes and maybe you'll get it!"" I don't understand. Why not just say ""Hey, you want this? That'll be $5, please. Chaching! Here's your skin, thank you for your business, and good day.""

 I just can't ""whole heartily"" recommend it until they nerf Seven (stylized VII), Skye, and Terminus. None of the above have any significant counters.

Every match is Skye vs Skye going ""l0l crossbow go brr dead"" x4 then she drops  a bomb to get a push-button pentakill. Not to mention her smoke screen can out heal the best support hero in the game. Seven has similar burst dps potential, and Terminus can push E and be invulnerable for most of the match. Did you finally kill him? That's ok: he'll self-res and explode to 1 shot any squishies in range. 

It could be semi-remedied by teamplay, but this community is so isolated from each other. Everyone I add/add's me doesn't talk to me at all. No one here is in any hurry to meet new friends and team up. This trickles into ranked play as well. 

People being people, ranked has all the same bull shift that is in every other online ranked game ever: no one wants to tank, no one wants to heal/locks 3 healers (meta is 1, maybe 2nd building dps), everyone want's to be the swordsman or the archer, silently trickling and feeding, ready to report you for calling them out on it to get you permanently banned for ""abusive toxicity"" (yeah I'm deliberately throwing this match with 30 deaths BUT BUT HE MADE ME FEEL BAD ABOUT IT!! GUILTY!!!) [OK to be fair, that's my Overwatch story, NOT Paladins].  Let's not forget the F2P classic: grumpy hispanics who's only English words are 'gg noob team report I afk"". Meanwhile, the enemy team is a 5 stack premade of close friends all communicating, creating meta-builds for their hero, complimenting each other with an excellent team composition, all with gold skins (ie they played that one hero a looooot), absolutely FEASTING on the 5 defenseless noobs on the other side....so, you know, every single ranked match of every single online game. Ever. 

Worst of all is this EAC (easy anti cheat) software you're forced to use. Many other players have voiced their concerns about how intrusive it is as a spyware like screenshotting your pc and/or keylogging it, even if the game isn't running.

It's a flawed gem, but let's be honest: what else is on the market that hasn't been a cesspool of ""fail"" memes in the past 10 years? You're gonna be like me and most other gamers: playing Paladins because...dammit there's just nothing else out there after Blizzard sold their souls to Micro$oft. 

We're all looking for a plot of sand to stick our head in as the powers-that-be slowly craft the prophesied Orwellian nightmare and Paladins is one of the better right now, so do some research on EAC and go for it.

Oh, and if you don't speak Spanish, don't bother."

But seriously, Hi-Rez did a good job and they came out with a good game. Many people will think that the game is just an Overwatch clone, but no, the game was developed before Overwatch, and many of the Paladins characters were made accordingly before the announcement. For example, Fernando and Reinhardt. Yes, they are very similar, but this is most likely just a coincidence, etc. the characters are somewhat similar to each other.

Among F2P games, it doesn't really stand out for its graphics, but it's still good,
There is a donate, but everything can be obtained for free, I like this policy
At the moment, there are already quite a lot of characters, besides, there will be even more later, which is logical
And most of all I liked the card system, I, of course
I did not notice inadequate players, which is already a big plus!

Criteria Score
Graphics among F2P projects 7.5/10
Gameplay 8.4/10
Variety 7.8/10
The game is not perfect, but it's definitely worth playing. Try it and it will drag you on for hundred of hours.
Thank you for reading my review, I hope it helped you!

6838,"The benefits of pouring milk before cereal.

Too long have those who pour milk before Cereal been considered heretics. The truth is, pouring milk before cereal is just as valid of a method as cereal before milk if not a better one.

Benefits:

You get to see the milk level accurately. Face it, cereal before milk is a guessing game on how much milk is actually in the bowl due to the irregular shapes and sizes of cereal. Too often you are left with a dry oasis of cereal and are forced to return to the refrigerator to retrieve the milk or even worse, you have a soup of milk that has irreversibly soaked your cereal into oatmeal.

The bottom of the cereal bowl doesn’t turn to mush as quickly. Because cereal floats, the milk before cereal method allows the bottom portion of the cereal to stay in the perfect equilibrium of crunchy yet moist that is so fleeting in the cereal experience. Whereas cereal before milk leaves you with the flooded sections of the Titanic with little time to evacuate the bottom section before they are drowned in milk.

Response to Common Criticism of the Milk before Cereal method

“But it’ll splash everywhere!” Cereal is lightweight and will not cause milk to overspill if the user pours at the correct angle. Furthermore, you can simply use a bigger bowl.

“But you can’t measure the cereal then!” Inaccurate as almost all cereal floats. The inaccuracy your cereal pour is outweighed by the inaccuracy of your milk pour if you used the cereal before milk method.

It is time we stop acting like barbarians and adopt the milk before cereal method."
6839,simply the best game ever.

6948,"I wish I could give this game a good review, having almost 90 hours in the game. Unfortunately, those are fucking wasted hours of my life I will never get back. I honestly do times have fun with this game at times, but for the wrong god damn reasons.

Snipers:
 I main Kinessa, a squishy sniper that outputs a fuck ton of damage. Snipers like Kinessa are busted as hell because the hitboxes on the character models are HORRENDOUS, giving you a lot of bullshit kills. All health in this game is inflated for whatever reason, the average DPS having 2100 health (as an example a fully charged Kinessa shot does 1200, allowing for 2 shots.). 

Character Roster:
You start with a very boring and limited champion roster, needing you to do a lot of grinding to obtain fun to play champions. 

Bugs:
one of the biggest problems is the number of bugs, I see this a lot in highly mobile characters. Sometimes you do a leap ability and you just...stop mid-jump. some shots will no reg, I've logged in and the UI is busted, tons more than just ruin the overall gameplay.

Skins:
There is very obvious favoritism, for example, Maeve getting multiple skins in the same year. 
It is insanely hard to get a wanted skin in this game, a majority of them having a crystal price impossible to realistically grind for, needing you to buy them with IRL money. Now, this isn't a problem in a free game, they need a way to get money after all. But then there are the chest exclusive skins which are a pain in the ass. A chest costs crystals, which unlike the base skins are much cheaper, allowing you to use them more. But for each chest...you can only get one item. And when you have chests like the ""golden chest"" which has a few hundred cosmetics in it, you can see the frustration in it. Some aesthetic-specific chests have about 10-15 cosmetics in them with a higher crystal mark up, needed you to either do some hard grinding or pull out the wallet. 

Auto Aim:
....why? This is a PvP fps shooter...why the hell would there be aimbot abilities? Now I may be called a hypocrite when my main (Kinessa) has an ultimate that gives her automatic headshots, but this ult still needs you to hit your shots in some way, giving her a few seconds of guaranteed damage buffs. So why the hell is there damage and flankers that have auto game abilities, letting them burst you down immediately. The fact that some character kits revolve around this is fucking ridiculous.

Tanks:
I know this is a bit of an unfair comparison but for a moment I wanna compare tanks in Paladins to Overwatch. In Overwatch, tanks can serve a multitude of purposes. They can play for picks, point pressure, dives/flanks, or help with overall team synergies. Now in Paladins (except for Torvald) tanks just feel like just a body on the point that's only purpose is for point pressure and to spam at the front line...that's it. I'm not saying all of the tanks are all just copy/pastes of each other, I do think evil mojo did a really good job giving them unique kits. But when you boil it down, the kits are just glorified |Engagement tool, sustain, and CC|, they just seem uninteresting after a while.

Ranked:
Don't. Fucking. Touch it.
Besides one skin (which there is a better version you can buy) there is absolutely no reason to play it besides taking your placements and thinking ""huh, that's where I placed."" then going back to casual. Casual has more game modes and less toxicity where you can have fun instead of getting screamed at for playing an off-meta champion or not banning a meta champion.

Graphics:
not going to get too into it, the cover and splash art looks honestly amazing, just look at the steam banner for it. Then there are the in-game character models which aren't necessarily bad, not great. It's a free game, not gonna bitch about it."
6949,easy anti cheat bad
6950,"good

6951,"Fun game to play casually and competitively. The only problem I have is the lack of players (especially in the high ranks). I used to be between High Diamond 1 and Masters, and when playing competitive you would always play the same few people over and over again. Its also fun to play with friends casually. Rarely any toxicity thanks to the VGS system which lets you freely communicate without having to type or speak."

6983,"Solid FPS game, I love it"
6984,Ok so I booted this game up and I started playing it it was fun for the most part until I realized that every time I played a match and won it would tell me I got a certain amount of gold in the notification bar but the gold I got did not add up to the amount it said I got which is really pissing me off. I yall wanna play this game go right ahead.
6985,yuh
6986,good game. Good for Engineer Gaming

6993,i like it and me and my friends play together yea. this is a good game to play once in a while with friends. cya ingame maybe bye.
6994,Decent Game!!! Solid game to play for a few months. The game does become repetitive once you play it enough.
6995,Better than overwatch tbh
6996,not really

7006,"It's basically a free Overwatch but with a much better art style in my opinion. It's fluid and smooth, great with friends and guaranteed a fun time! I highly recommend it, not only for the gameplay itself but also the amount of customisation you are free to do!"
7007,yes sir
7008,yes
7009,buggy af
7010,its a fun game to play with friends
7011,fuck dig cunt
7012,It is a very good and fun to play game... BUT it crashes soooo muchh. please fix this
7013,"Paladins has a rocky history, and has more bugs than the developers seem to know what to do with, but the passion behind this game is undeniable. Competitively, it's the most fun I've ever had in the genre. With a fun and diverse set of champions to choose from, the varied maps to keep things fresh, and consistent content drops, Paladins is currently experiencing a bit of a renaissance to it's golden age, with a dedication to new content being proven over the last year. Despite not all of these ventures not working out, it's clear that the developers do actually care, and I can only hope the game has a bright future ahead of it still. All you gotta do is have fun and play!"
7014,ass
7015,Its like Overwatch but free and you cant beat free.
7016,"you propably wanted download this game, because you thought that this would be a free overwatch alternative. well you aren't wrong, but also: fanservise."

7041,"Just an absolutely amazing game! I've been around since this game began, and while it's vastly different than how it began, it has only gotten better over time! Don't let anyone tell you ""its just free Overwatch,"" because not only is this game better than Overwatch (having been an avid OW player myself), the balancing is better, there are mechanics that OW NEVER had or will ever have that makes every match intense, the characters are incredible and diverse, and it's just overall a better game! DEFINITELY worth playing, for anyone that enjoys these kinds of games!"
7042,...
7043,this is what overwatch gave me in its prime now that game is rotting in its own shit and this is superior and should start raping the video game industry
7044,better than overwatch

7046,"I played this game at launch and just recently came back to it. This game is fun for the most part, they desperately need a better way to match up roles in the game like Overwatch has. Overwatch has an option in game where you can pick if you want to play tank,healer etc, which would really help make this game better imo. The battle passes are lackluster and not even worth it compared to some of the other games out there that offer them, so I personally wouldn't waste your money, maybe buy some characters instead. With that being said, they do offer a few rotating characters so you are never stuck with just the few they give you to start with.   3.75/5"
7047,toxic player base amazing gameplay
7048,One of the worst shooter experiences I've ever had would recommend not playing this.
7049,"Buggy at times, but honestly one of my faves. Would recommend it to fans of OW etc. (fyi, if you do play it, then use your credits to buy items by pressing i)"
7050,"absolute trash of a game, I get forced to play because of my friends and each time I open this game I lose braincells."
7051,"Good game! :)
"
7052,"It's a pretty good game, great skins, frequent new content, but one of the worst experiences in gaming during comp. People are super tilted if you don't do things the way they want, they're not just mad they're cussing you out even before the game has started, maybe its because the game is free. Quick play is pretty good though."

7054,best game ever
7055,Fun game to kill time. Seems more laid back than some games.
7056,You will love this game if you're a masochist
7057,Great Game!
7058,"Its an FPS MOBA like Smite. I do like Smite better, as well as a few lesser known MOBAs like Spellbreak. But in the MOBA world variety is the spice of life. This is a quality MOBA with solid servers and unique character designs. Would recommend, especially if you are familiar with MOBAs and looking to take a break from your main title. Cause for some gosh dang reason I always find myself back playing League of Legends."

Overall Game
----------------------------------------
KnightShift is a unique blend of RPG and top-down adventure. It can be played as a strategy game, an RPG, or a hybrid mix.

Seemingly very low-budget, KS still brings an interesting, if not intricate, gameplay to the gamer. For those who can tolerate the lower-end graphics and quirkiness of the game (I find it cute how the prince takes a nap, for example, as odd as it is), KnightShift will bring a good round of exploratory gameplay in an indie package that I'd recommend for a fun few hours of Princedom.

Overall Rating: 8/10

Gameplay
----------------------------------------
Warning: There are a LOT of keys/key combinations to remember for this game.

If you're undaunted, the next hurdle to overcome is a slightly awkward mouse control that seems to be reminiscent of Windows 98 mouse acceleration insanity. Once familiarized with it, the mouse awkwardness stops detracting from the interface.

I'm not sure if there were audio cues for some things, but I learned haphazardly that the giant withcraft looking areas are healing spas. This was useful fighting my first few bears. The lesson here is just to explore the areas, as context tooltips don't really exist to assist in understanding what is around you in the game.

Although rough around the edges, the quirky gameplay and level-matched quests can catch you and lure you in for more from this game. The random encounter fights contribute a little to exp farming and provide a balanced challenge as you build up your equipment set and character.

Overall Accessibility
----------------------------------------
KnightShift has dialogue that is not subtitled, making the plot a little inconvenient to follow. I don't blame the developers, who, as a small indie group, made the game because they wanted to, and did so as best they could.

Because I was unable to properly test multiplayer, the overall rating is based on only the subtitles category.

Rating: 7/10

Subtitles/Text
----------------------------------------
KnightShift is an indie game on a unique platform. That said, it's not subtitled or captioned. Deaf/HoH players can still read the text of what was said after by hitting F2 a few times, which cycles through the 'mission log' and flavor text/mission text.

At first I found it annoying, but I find the workaround tolerable and am happy they included it.

Rating: 7/10

Chatting/Communicating
----------------------------------------
While KS has multiplayer capability, I did not test. Based on the keyboard options, I saw no key for chat.

Rating: N/A"
7084,Worth Playing!

7125,"There are insane amounts of bugs in this game and servers are kinda crap, but the game itself is pretty good."
7126,"Terrible community and just boring gameplay. The only reason I've got almost 300 hours of gameplay on record is because my little brother is crazy about overwatch but can't have it so he settled for this crap (and even he says, ""This game is way worse than overwatch, but better than nothing"") 

Nothing in this game feels unique. Everything feels like a ripoff, even the things that aren't. It's like they don't have a clear vision for a game. They were just like, ""let's make a hero shooter"" with no other ideas or anything else. The characters are like the wish versions of LoL champions. And also most of the game just feels weird. Most characters mechanics' feel weird and out of place and don't have intresting traits (gmaeplay wise and personality), most game mechanics feel weird and out of place, the story is not good (I didn't even know this game had any story tbh), the art style doesn't really fit with the rest of the game or what it's trying to be and the game is heavily unbalanced. Ever wanted to play a game where one of the character's ult could snipe you across the map and hit you through walls and if you get hit it's a instant kill? Yeah that's one of the support characters... fun,right?

Not to mention the community. Unranked is fine, but ranked? OMFG KILL ME NOW. If you meet someone new and they tell you they're a ranked paladins player, get a restraining order immediately and this is coming from someone who plays LoL. I've never seen a more toxic community then this game's ranked players. Our entire team got killed once (because they're murder hobos that went all in even though they never stood a chance) and as support I knew if just ran away they'll blame it all on me, but then after they got killed it was a solid 5min of them sitting in base and trash talking eachother and that's when I stopped playing this game. Don't think the community alone was what made me quit, it was just straw that broke the camel's back; the tipping point if you will. In total I guess I only got like 8 hours in this game. Like I said, the rest was my little brother, but at this point he has also given up on the game.

I don't think I can give advice on how to fix things. Everything was a clusterfuck from the beginning and the devs just added more and more crap to the pile over the years instead of fixing things. So, don't expect it to be much better in the near future or even the distant future for that matter. The only thing this game is good for is shutting up your younger siblings"

7153,"Love this game <3 I'm not a first person shooter kind of gamer, and I've been looking for a game with a perfect combination. This does it for me. I love the theme and the character design. Especially the newer characters. I like the variety of play style choices. I've been playing heavily for a few days and my favorite character has changed 3 times.  All I can say is keep bring me new amazing skins. It makes the game so aesthetically pleasing. If you're debating playing this game there is a video on youtube talking about free games on steam. This game was mentioned and they do a great job breaking it down."
7154,bad game worse then overwatch thats why i play it
7155,the game has lost a lot of good players as of late and will continue to lose them. Your forced to play with bots with bad AI/ toxic people/ spammers/ game breaking bugs /people that just feed/ trolls/ bad match making/ laggy servers and much more or you take the chance of getting banned. these issues are in every game but banning people for going afk cause one or more of these issues is happening is just foolish.
7156,"I dont recommend this game for one simple reason. Its community. It seems no matter how old this game gets, its playerbase still dont understand the basic concept of needing a tank/healer to actually win games. 

They keep going 4 damage dealers because shooting is fun. What this game needs to get more than 10k concurrent players is to add a Role-selector when you queue up, so you get queued with atleast 1 healer, 1 frontline every match. 
I main frontline and healer, and it sucks being a healer to 4 squishy cookies who almost never outdamage the enemies frontliners anyway OR frontline in a team without a healer. The last couple of years ive only been able to play a handfull of matches before uninstalling it again due to the annoyance it brings me. This game does not feel fun to play, it feels annoying and obnoxious and thats due to people not knowing how to pick.

Seriously, when a game that is objective based has a community that rather just picks characters that give them stats that dont mean anything since that shit isnt saved, then you know you either needs to implement something to force people to pick for objectives or change your game-structure.

To clarify to the ""check his time ingame"" people who cant read if it isnt in numbers, most of those hours was when Paladins was new and people actually wanted to win in it. the community and by extension the game has since dropped in quality considerably. i do not recommend the game IN THIS STATE.

PS; The ranked is botched in this game too but for other reasons, in season 1 i was diamond so ive got some experience in ranked (atleast in the earlier days), but nowadays its people who cannot play together to save their life, they spend more time screaming at one another over which champion is op and should be banned pregame than they do actually playing the match, its borderline funny just to sit back and read - up untill the match starts and you realise you have to spend 20+ minutes with these people."
7157,It's great -get it you scrubs
7158,"pvserseky 👍
"
7159,"This is a great game if you want to bully others, the community has toxic people but among them, you get the best kind who you're head to head with with skill making the match exciting. Over all I've loved this game since I got it, too many bugs and questionable game design choices that make me cringe, matching beginners with non beginners, delays in abilities causing you to be killed and that bug where you're in third person on drugs and the only way to solve it is to get hit. Other than that and a few other things, I highly enjoy the play style and can't wait for the bugs and glitches to be fixed along the way :)."
7160,Overwatch but not dead.
7161,yes
7162,"TLDR: Play if you want to play overwatch or cod without getting 2 fps.

This game is awesome. Servers for nearly every location and a huge playerbase. I have a shitty office laptop and yet I can still run this game at high graphics. Definitely recommend this game to people with shit laptops or computers."

This game is a waste of time and an embarrassment .
It's a pity because it's fun.
Uninstalling right now and deleting from my library."
7172,"It's a fun game to play with friends, and alone if you're bored, definitely would recommend it for a free to play first person shooter game."
7173,enjoyable
7174,Overw
7175,"Trying to enjoy this game because Overwatch with no updates is getting stale. I just cant, it looks worse, feels worse, sounds worse, plays worse. The only thing it has going for it is an abundance of heroes but many of them are not particularly creative, except for some reason the tanks. The healers all seem to heal the exact same way, hold alt fire. Meanwhile literally every healer in OW has a different form of heal. I really wish this game could stand up to Overwatch like Smite can to League of Legends. Also final point, horses are stupid."
7176,very gud game really like the mechanics!
7177,"Friend at work told me about this game and I skeptical at first. After about an hour I fell in love. It's free, it's fun, and it has several different characters to play as. Of course many of them are locked but the in game currency is very easy to earn, and you can practice as the character before you buy them to make sure you like the way they play. Since that friend at work told me about the game I have told it to each of my friends that play video games. Additionally the game is cross-play so you can play with any and all of your friends"

7183,"[h1]How to Make Fettuccine Alfredo[/h1]

Alright boys and girls today i have you here an absolutely Fantastic Fettuccine Alfredo recipe, that even Grandma Betty would approve, Alright lets get to it.

Homemade Fettuccine may have a few steps, but each step is EASY – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal. The ingredients in this recipe are all things you know and it’s not difficult at all! All you’ll need for this easy Fettuccine recipe is one pan, one bowl, and a 9×13 baking dish.

TIPS FOR MAKING PERFECT FETTUCCINE ALFREDO:
1. Start by bringing water to a boil in a large pot. Add salt to the water to season the pasta. Once it is boiling, add pasta and cook according to package instructions.

2. Saute the garlic and butter together until softened -- about 1 to 2 minutes.

3. Add heavy cream and let simmer over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes to thicken. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth.

4. Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.

5. Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.

6. Garnish with Italian parsley, if so desired.

Ingredients

▢1 lb Fettuccine Pasta
▢6 Tablespoons Butter
▢1 Garlic Clove (minced)
▢1½ cups Heavy Cream
▢1/4 teaspoon Salt
▢1 1/4 cup Shredded Parmesan Cheese
▢1/4 teaspoon Pepper
▢2 Tablespoons Italian Parsley (optional)

Instructions
1. In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to season the water. Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook according to package instructions.

2. In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream.

3. Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.

4. Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.
Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.

5. Garnish with Italian parsley, if so desired.

Recipe Notes
▢Use real parmesan cheese, which is refrigerated.

▢If you like it to be more ""saucy"", you may use less than 1 lb. of fettuccine pasta. 

▢Leftover pasta water may be used to thin out pasta sauce. Do not take a bath with it."

7196,fun but needs a lot of work to sustain itself it's dying because the devs think of it as a cash grab and i think that's sad because its a fun game but its gonna die soon if they dont put some time and care into it
7197,nice
7198,"The game is actually fun!  Gameplay, characters, mechanics, and art style as well!  The only known and glaring issue are the bugs which they should (and hopefully) be fixing by now.  Otherwise, it will be a bane to many players to come.  Old and new../"
7199,mach making is terrible. if some leaves in the loading screen it locks everyone in till whatever decides its been to long. this can be up to 30 mins to an hour.

7243,"i highly recommend this fantastic masterpiece of a video game, the gunplay, characters, teamwork, scenery, every single thing about the game paladins is amazing, you are missing out if you do not atleast try it. the devs even give 3 heroes that you'd normally have to buy to try out, they switch every so often. absolutely perfect FPS."
7244,"skye.
"
7245,"Reinstalled by curiosity. Half the player don't pick skills lol, There is not even an option to report AFK players. 99% of the game can only be bought with real money gems (except heroes). Come on, what a shame of a game, not sure who plays this, bots ?"
7246,"graphics look straight out on an n64 regardless of graphics settings, with my gpu usage only sitting at 50%. i did research found that multiple other people are having this bug and its been around since 2016 and the developers just dont care enough to fix it."

7251,"Yet another great game destroyed by their own devolpers...
I really love paladins, It's one of the fastest games I've ever played. Even with It's problems, the game is still fun but Hi-Rez is completely just killing their game, it is losing players since the release but they don't care. This game isn't far from being completelly dead.

This is one of the most fun and fast paced hero shooters, but the problem is: 
-It is full of bugs, some that are game breaking
-Terrible balancement
-Constant release of new characters that is something that can look good but in the end just overloads the game
-Focus from the devs on only releasing oversexualized characters and skins to attract kids to the game 
-Lack of content updates like maps, and new mechanics (only thing they do is deleting some)
-Lack of polishment (for example, character animations look awesome in first person but look super bland from the other player's vision, even the models look super basic)
-Easily 60% of the matches there's someone AFK'ing even in casual, which means that they need to get a better punishment

Hi-rez, please stop killing your game."
7252,Game bad just get overwatch
7253,:D
7254,Corvus do you like me back
7255,"EU Servers: queueing for a match is a gamble that could cause your game to freeze and be unplayable for 1-3 hours

Hi-rez: Yes, very sad. Anyway.."

7265,게임은 매우 재미 있고 나는 그것을 좋아합니다. 내가 가장 좋아하는 캐릭터는 Io와 Lian입니다. 그래픽도 좋고 게임도 잘돌아가서 잠깐만 해봤는데 특히나 친구들이랑 할때 엄청 재밌어요 <3
7266,"Another prime example of wasted potential.

This game had something going, for a while. The ""moba"" mechanics introduced (such as itemizations and character building) were a really good idea. However, 2 or 3 good ""ideas"" are not enough to keep something afloat if controversial decisions are made, specially ""character balance wise"".

The devs can't fix their own engine, there are many reports of weird frame drops. There's no ultrawide support (even though you can select it in-game it doesn't actually work, at least didn't work here), and no, I'm not gonna ""manually"" set ultrawide via NVidia / Driver changes as some people stated. That's just absurd, if there's support, then it just works, simple as that.

But even if you tolerate the issues above, the main problem, in my opinion, still remains. The game is stuck on a loop of ""pseudo content"". The devs launch some new characters every couple months, ""revamp"" some maps, and that's it. There's no new game mode, for the time I've played I haven't seen, real, ""new"" maps (just the same map design with different textures).

As stated, the game had a lot of potential, it looks like it could be really fun,  better at balancing and managing match gameplay (through items / builds ), etc. But sadly, I feel like the ""best"" part of this game were the skins. They had real work put on, amazing particles, unique interactions, really cool references (Rave MAEVE is just insane) .... but that's it.

For me to take what's mine, until the end of time
We were more than friends, before the story ends,
And I will take what's mine, create what
God would never design
Our love had been so strong for far too long,
I was weak with fear that
Something would go wrong,
Before the possibilities came true,
I took all possibility from you
Almost laughed myself to tears,
Conjuring her deepest fears
(come here you fucking bitch)
Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times,
I can't believe it,
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes,
Eyes over easy, eat it eat it eat it
She was never this good in bed
Even when she was sleepin'
Now she's just so perfect I've
Never been quite so fucking deep in
It goes on and on and on,
I can keep you lookin' young and preserved forever,
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time
But bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry
You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, we fell apart
Let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime yeah

7330,"It feels like half the games gets stuck on the loading screen. Afterwards its impossible to start a new game, because it forces you to loading the same game which gets stuck again. You have to wait like 20-30 minutes before you can queue again.

When you get a match, the winning outcome is 80% determined by which team ends up with the least leavers, worthless bots og bad players (because if a useless ranking system) and not really by skill or gameplay.

This is a real shame, because the game is actually great and really fun, but a lot of things around the game sucks so much ass it strips it of everything that is really fun about it.

I think the developers have moved on to other projects or something, because it seems like these problems have gone on forever.

I experience the mentioned on several different computers and even using Geforce Now on a remote box."

They don't listen to complaints from their users about gameplay issues such as toxicity and issues with crashing, but you can tolerate it for the time you're playing it long enough before getting fed up and going back to something better. The best this game can provide is an alternative experience to their counterparts. Overwatch is better quality but this is just a different, lower quality experience."

7414,"Can I just say, this game is actually so much fun and a real time passer. But for the LOVE of god! Stay well away from ranked. I've never encountered such a toxic ranked community in my life and I've put many hours on Overwatch and Valorant. Every ranked game, assuming you find one (20+ wait time) nobody plays ranked because its actually a living hell for casual players. You'll always get one person who's either eating their mic at you for not healing or for not doing enough damage. Or they cry because they don't like your card loadout, how you play, your position on the map etc. I never finished my placement matches because Id rather consume a mini cactus in its entirety than finish them. All my games just consisted of people screaming at eachother with the most pathetic reasons. And half the time, these little hormone freaks that yell at the team are often not actually playing with the team. (Mainly Victor mains) 

So yeah in conclusion, just play against A.I with friends. Even regular multiplayer is a hit or miss on toxicity. Like chill everyone. ITS A FUCKING FREE TO PLAY GAME!"

7419,"Me with any champion that requires some sort of skill: 
""Idk what I'm doing what do these abilities do again?

Me with Tyra:
""Haha gun go BRRRRRR""

No but seriously everyone making memes about this being the budget Overwatch which is true but it's so much better than Overwatch with it's much more fun and not boring at all champions, to the Champion customisation with the card loadouts. 

Defo give this one a try if you like games like Overwatch and want to actually have fun."
7420,good soup
7421,fun
7422,Amazing game great characters and aslo amazing gameplay. I recommend this game :)
7423,beep boop
7424,Its alright
7425,"First off I'd gonna be a real negative Nancy here about the art style and I'm maybe one of like six people who actually care about but I digress. Paladins as of writing this as four art styles and it looks like a colourful mess, There is this really hard to read comic book art style in which they use these heavy black outlines on literally anything and it just comes off as messy to me anyway and yes I know art is subjective but I feel very strongly about this. They (Hi-rez/Evil Mojo what the heck ever they're still apart of Hi-rez) used this art style for like a year and half until people on Reddit started to complain about it too and they even went as far as replacing better perceived art for some of the champions which was so weird. It was like trading in a brand new car for some clunker from the 80s, made zero sense whatsoever. Then they have this really detailed ""realistic"" style with really subdued colours in comparison to the comic book style which was just screaming colours. Now there is this like Photoshop with Blender art style if you can even call it an art style in which they just take the model, put it into a pose and just draw around the model to add detail to the background without having to do the effort of redrawing the character; You can see this alot in Rei's and Vatu's art. The final one is just a screenshot of the character doing a pose like finger guns or something or just an idle animation on top of a blue background; this is for singular cosmetics like Kinessa's Chillweave beanie and the like. Please for the love of god just stick to one style. While I'm still on a roll here I'd like to talk about Paladins' current art director, I'm sure you've at least know of him or heard of him in some passing reference but he has done some nice stuff for Paladins. Keyword there, has. ThunderBrush doesn't really know how to keep it professional about Paladins, and what I mean by that is he will openly debate people on Twitter regardless of if it's just a troll ""y u creat furri character"" or legitimate criticism he'd respond to it the same way and it all comes off as very childish and extremely cringe. I'm not done about him yet though. So I think it was two years ago a skin was released for a champion named Pip ( Anthro Fox with goggles ) that made him her. Pepper was created as a Genderbent Latina Gamer Girl Alt Universe Possible Scenario of Pip and this skin alone created so much controversy that people were evening trying to get the skin removed; no way in H E double hockey sticks was that ever gonna happen so ThunderBrush using his ability to talk calmly and talk in criticism very well made a post on Twitter saying something among the lines of ""If you all keep complaining about Pepper then we're going to add another one called Salt"". Not word for word what he said obviously but that was general gist of it so now we've come full circle. The Final Patch of 2021 would add Salt to the game two years after people stopped caring and it was all reignited again. I am fine with genderbending characters for skins, SMITE another Hi-Rez game does this very well actually and is actually professional about it, I am fine with Anthropomorphic characters as skins and even as just base characters. What bothers me about Pepper and to a lesser extent Salt is the sexualization of them and again mainly Pepper; Salt is covered up and looks nice and presentable. If you are going to sexualize a character go all the way and make that the main point of the character like Evelynn from League of Legends or don't do it at all because of stuff like this happens and just makes people upset and grossed out at least I was. They (being I don't know whoever the hell decided this was okay to put into the game) pushed the Pepper sex appeal thing even further by added a JPEG of Pepper as like a Cleopatra likeness but haha cats and put her in bandage wraps and a very loose gold skirt. You can look it up yourself but I went to church that following sunday after that image released.

The next thing I'd like to talk about is the Champions themselves and how I feel about them as a whole with some specific cases. Character design is something I wish Paladins marketed more about the game because while yes some characters (Kinessa, Viktor) are very similar to other games; the actual design of the majority are very pleasant to look at. Just some examples are Inara, Mal'damba, Vora, and Imani are some of my personal favourites. Now as I mentioned earlier Character Skins are the main income of Paladins as far as we're aware of I don't know what else would even be remotely worth buying to be honest with you. There have been and unfortunately always will be a set of around 6 characters that won't get skins in a blue moon; Please offer a prayer so people can actual have fun with the customization options for the their favourite characters. Atlas, Yagorath, Talus, Willo, Torvald, Sha Lin, Buck, and Evie all will wait upwards of two and half years for just a singular skin. Hi-Rez/Evil Mojo has gotten a tiny bit better about this by offer these character's skin for free by just playing Ranked (Which is absolute joke by the way it's just casuals with sometimes better matchmaking) but some of the characters I just mentioned still haven't gotten a skin in a while; Sha Lin and Atlas specifically because they both got their last skin on the the same patch two and half years ago and haven't gotten one since. Maeve, Ying, Lian, Cassie, Seris, and Furia are the queens of getting skins when they shouldn't but who cares right as long as the money rolls in why does it matter. It shows a lot when devs say they care and they do stuff like this. People really aren't asking for much, god I'd be happy with a recolour of the base model at this point. No online PVP game that uses skins as a monetization option has gotten this right yet. For Overwatch it's Symmetra, For League it's Skarner, Fiddlesticks; You get the point. All in all it's extremely demoralizing and frustrating to watch Ying and Maeve get a skin every 3 months and Atlas , Sha Lin and Torvald wait roughly 3 years. Here we go with ThunderBrush strikes again with not being able to keep it professional on Twitter. Quite of few people asked him a while ago on Twitter about when they could expect another Willo or Torvald skin or if there was even talk of one even happening and again not his exact words but he replies with (Probably never cause they are really unpopular champs, play lian instead). What a shitty way to reply to someone asking a genuine question and moreover a CUSTOMER. 

Hi-Rez/Evil Mojo is up next because I don't know if they ever publicly explained why but I'm gonna give you the short version of it. Evil Mojo is just a floor at the Hi-Rez office in Atlanta, Georgia. It's not a separate company, it's not different people, it's just a subdivision of Hi-Rez. Why? In their words it was to minimize the negative image of Hi-Rez studios. SMITE has an alias, Rogue Company does, Realm Royale does too. Did it work? Look at this review and you tell me. I have nothing against the people at Hi-Rez; They are all wonderful people and some of them even go out of their way to interact with players however they can some people I wanna shoutout are @TitanPonPon, @TitanForgeTina, @Romanova. Romanova specifically pushes for a ton of LGBTQIA+ Mega Collection, Final Mix, Act 2 and Knuckles representation in Paladins and that's nice cause she doesn't have to do any of that but she chooses too. My issues with Hi-Rez are purely with them as a company not them as individual people. 

That is all I have to say about Paladins and I hope someone gleamed something useful out of this. All in all I still have fun with the game but that might not be the same for you. Good Luck."

7439,can be a lot of fun when everything works and your team stays online
7440,good team fighting game with variety of characters to play

7449,"It's a free to play team based FPS and is exactly what you'd expect. There's a few game modes, a ton of characters with loads of cosmetics the game pushes you to pay real money for, and okay gameplay. I guess if you're looking for a free PvP multiplayer game you could do worse but nothing really stands out about it."
7450,actually good overwatch ripoff
7451,"This is the 3rd best game i own.w
Aside from Honkai impact and Dragon Ball Xenoverse

I can confidently say that this game is worth wasting hundreds of hours. for some reason i've only played 91 hours on steam but meh, still got my ingame stats so i'm good.

recently got the gold pack, which increases the fun tenfold since you wont have to grind insanely long hours if you want one of the higher-tier characters but they are 100% obtainable through ingame events that give 60K+ gold per completion of said event. 

As for cosmetics, it's a bit cash-grabby but honestly all games are nowadays. at least in the cosmetics department.

I love the game and 100% approve as well as recommend it for people getting into a class-based team-battle game. much more interesting than overwatch at least lol"
7452,"This game is a very cool and epic game, I would recommend this to people who like games like overwatch because of the similarities"
7453,its really fun
7454,"this game is absolute garbage 
send help
"
7455,"This game is the simplest game ever. If you cover every role and actually play the role how it is meant to be played you will win EVERY SINGLE TIME. no doubt. BUT if you are unlucky like me and get nothing but absolute morons on your team, then just quit the match. OH WAIT, YOU CAN'T!! the only option is to close out of the game entirely. WTF!?

I'm gonna start a business. If you want to have a 100% chance of winning ANY type of team based game, then just play against my team. BECAUSE I ALWAYS FREAKING LOSE! I can guarantee you a win.

Here is a list of games that you can always win if you play against me:

-Paladins
- Overwatch
- Valorant
- TF2
- Splitgate
- Red Dead Online
- GTA Online
- And literally any other team based game

7456,"It´s ok, I guess"
7457,Better overwatch
7458,"I like it, sometimes its buggy but it’s not that bad :)"
7459,"Never play this game, even if you think you like it.

Even if the ugly graphics, constant lags, glitches, monotonous gameplay do not scare you away, know:
The more you give yourself to this game, the more it will hit you in the face.
The more you succeed in this game, the more the game will prevent you from doing it.
I'm talking primarily about matchmaking and about boosting / nerfing players to achieve the ""perfect balance"" in the game.
You can lose 20 games in a row doing your best, and win the same number in a row without doing absolutely nothing.
If the game pulls you in, it is quite difficult to stop, because the game manipulates you very well.

Don't waste your time on this game, it's not worth it."

7463,"Servers are dogshit at the moment and the game is covered in bugs which will never be fixed. But it's free, has no pay2win whatsoever and has a somewhat active playerbase, and you can unlock any characters you want to play for free, there are also cards(ALL unlocked by default no lootbox bs there) and talents(all unlocked after 2 hours spent playing choosen champion) which let you play 1 character in several different ways. You shouldn't play it unless devs publically announce a servers fix(in which case it will be a great and fun experience and you definitely should play it if you like shooters or moba's or both)"
7464,fire game
7465,"What a go-d dam-n load of bull fu-ck this game is. Like 90% of the player base has the iq of a goldfish that just got its head stomped on by the Incredible Hulk. It's unbelievable how stupid these people are, I could find more intelligent people if I was Stevie Wonder wandering through the sewers riding on giant farting mole rats. The gameplay is stale because its the same op boring champions being played and abused over and over and over like holy sh-it. It's just bootleg Overwatch. And I HATE Overwatch too, if I could review it on steam too I would say how much that game is also a giant heaping pile of cow turds too. Hi-Rez just sucks at making games, maybe instead of making them free they should just PAY US to tolerate and play their disgusting rotten putrid pile of HORRID GNAT ASS EXCUSE OF VIDEO GAMES!!!!"
7466,love this game easy to pick up play and put back down lol
7467,I really like this game i would reccomend this to players who like action fighting or fantasy themed games
7468,
7469,good
7470,"BUGGED AS HELL ; after picking at character selection screen game will load map , then it will go back to character selection and will not let you click anything ... bugged 

then you restart the APP ....   game after loading will go constant map loading ( trying to rejoin ? )

7477,"game went down for maintenance when i was at 99% capture on a 3-1 ranked game, would not recommend anyone ever download this game. hi rez is more concerned with adding new characters to the game every 2 months and reworking old maps than fixing the instability and bugs in their game. matchmaking is always bad, it is 99% impossible to get good teammates (the 1% chance is if you are partied up with 4 other people and are placed against people who just installed the game). also the salt skin exists, so if the previous bit of the review didn't convince you enough to not install the game, that ugly ass skin should lock it in. beta was 5 years ago already but the game still doesn't run properly. lets add new game modes though! and reports do nothing, even if your teammates are throwing, and the bots are basically an immediate L once someone leaves. go buy overwatch if you're even considering playing paladins still"
7478,It's got cross-platform & cross-progression (except Playstation)!

Never start playing this game."

7484,game is good i guess
7485,Pirkka overwatch
7486,"This game is starting to die out as tons of bugs are not overlooked at, other than the devs just stacking up more skins, map renovations, game balances (which is good but it's not the case), adding more champions every 2 months, and more garbage decisions like changing the battle pass functionality, quests with no correct tracking, bounty store, etc.

Server Lag is severe and painful. No it is not my computer or my internet connection. 90% of the time, it's the game's servers being fucked all over. Probably because devs don't experience such thing in their side cuz they are stupid enough to realize that they are the closest to the servers or something. Why can't I jump? Why can't I cast my skills? Why can't I move right? Why am I teleporting everywhere? Why is everyone on my screen drifting to places? Answer is simple. Server is bad.

Matchmaking on the other hand is extremely stinky. We have Normal Matchmaking, Ranked, Training, and Custom. Yep. No Events or Alternative Gamemodes other than Siege, Team Deathmatch, Onslaught (Onslaught/King of the Hill), Training Siege, Training Team Deathmatch, Training Onslaught (Onslaught/King of the Hill). Absolutely no alternative gamemodes. Some Limited Time Modes exist, but why are they not permanent as a category or playable in Custom?

Back to my point about Matchmaking. It's stinky. You want to have fun in a Casual Server, but instead you are fighting against higher ranks. This does make sense with the lack of players, but it's not a great excuse cuz Ranked is not many people's tempo. With this horrible matchmaking, we are basically queueing for RNG to have good players. Which 80% of the time is bad. I wanted to play as this champion with my friends to have some funny memes, just to be ruined by a tryhard Evie, Cassie, Androxus, whatever.

Character Balancing is tame but needs a lot of work for every single character. A lot of the older characters are being forgotten and only remembered when mentioned or overlapped at the selection screen. One of the examples are Ruckus. Ruckus is a good example of a DPS Tank but a bad pick 90% of the time by how defenseless he is from multiple people that his own shield and healing gained is not enough to even tank. A skilled player knows how to use Ruckus, but many beginners (and intermediates like me) are not getting any better result with a character that is trying to do what the character's role is, but not being able to by the lack of its requirements to be the character.

Please Devs. Fix the Matchmaking and Server Lag. I can't take it anymore. I've been wanting and craving to play Paladins, but couldn't because of these issues. Your game is becoming unfun for literally anybody who joins in. It's just not the way it is supposed to be.

Add up more gamemodes as a category and bring back older gamemodes than just turning them into a Limited Time Mode. I want to experience the Payload gamemode of this game than having to deal with steroid people in Siege. I'm indeed getting tired of this game that I'd prefer playing Team Fortress 2 than this."
7487,"great
"
7488,"Honestly i played this game a while ago and remember it being fun, trying it out again is a different story. Quickplay is only against bots and you can't mute voice chat using tab. Getting champs isn't even worth it as it takes much too long to get the things you actually want. IMO not worth the play even though its free, go play league or something."
7489,"Fun game overall. It's more fun when you play with friends, although there's many tryhards on asia servers so i don't really know what's happening."
7490,"Takes 15m to get into a competitive lobby. The role selection process is far too long. A lot the devs could learn from overwatch in regards to matchmaking. Good game, but you'll spend more time waiting than playing."
7491,"One of the best games in Steam - it's free, lightweight and really fun to play with friends. You can play it even on low-end PC and it's still with good graphics. There are a lot of characters and cards."
7492,POOR
7493,"Well look at all these tin horns. Now, where in tarnation is a man a leisure such as myself to find an honest game of chance around here? I would not be looking at your saloon, madam."

7508,Overwatch also exists but this has a funny silly charm to it that makes me laugh
7509,"In my opinion this game is alot better then overwatch beacuse of one thing that overwatch doesn't have ""Cards' with cards you can make your champion however like you can reduce cooldown , give your champion more health , deal more damage and much more i saw some people say that paladins is rip-off overwatch It's really not beacuse paladins started before overwatch, but of course im gonna rescpect everyone's opinion on this and just say that Paladins and Overwatch are equally good games."
7510,boobs
7511,"way better than Overwatch for sure tbh

7516,Moji is the second coming of the Anti christ but other that pretty good
7517,"I just picked this game up after finally breaking up with overwatch and honestly it's such a breath of fresh air. Unlocking the champs blows but everyone has three different talents that you can choose from at the start of the match. These change how the champion plays, sometimes changing whole abilities. Items can also be purchased throughout the match that can also affect how your champion plays such as faster reload time or more damage to shields. These two things alone give the game so much more depth than overwatch. There are also loadouts that you make for every champion that affect everything such as ammo cooldowns and health. I haven't unlocked everyone yet but if you're a fan of overwatch looking for something else to play you have to give it a shot."
7518,"good stuff, glad to see it could inspire other games like tf2 and overwatch."
7519,"it is a very delightful expirience.

7522,Good game like overwatch but gets up dates.

7524,love it gate game.

garbage game"

7535,"I love playing this game, because I like that when you choose a champion you have to learn and get used to them and you can't change when you pick a champion to give you a better chance of winning you either lose the game or you change tactics to pick off enemys one by one."

"
7551,The characters are hot
7552,"I used to like this game. Unfortunately it is no longer playable. This is due to the player base. It is dwindling down to almost nothing, over 10 min queues. When you do finally get in a game there is a good chance people pick 5 damage and you auto loose in ranked. I used to be in games with Z1, RCsoldier, Rockmonkey, and the likes that were pro players. The games were hard faught and fun. Now they are unplayable. I feel it is not Hi-Rez fault this time. Maybe if they had made different decisions they could have attracted a better playerbase. But those who remain are ruining the game."
7553,yeah maeve is fun
7554,"good, lots of thicc characters so that's good. --Jenos main"
7555,this game sucks i got banned for nothing no appeal system and also just a bad reporting scene

7571,"Game sux, buggy as hell, shit balance"
7572,i love pally been playing for years F OVERWATCH
7573,This game is trash when it comes to guns because every character with a gun is way to Op and they need a nerd but the devs dont care abt are opinion so they can making it more trash
7574,Literally better than overwatch
7575,1:30 hour waiting to play again because of a damn bug and not even a hotfix for this
7576,it's ok
7577,I'd fuck Meave 10/10
7578,This is a great game to play with your friends to have a good time
7579,Pip go boing boing
7580,game is super bad.. full of bugs and trashy match making... i recommend playing this game none stop for 7 months then never wanting to play this game ever again... but still play the game.
7581,I have spent lots of time with this game and I can say that there is one of the most friendly community I have experienced.
7582,"Real fun, much lags ,broken champs , way too many skins, but still fun game."
7583,lol
7584,when we play a match it loads forever then we quit the game then play again AND THEN IT LOADS UNTIL IT DOES BUT U CANT PRESS ANYTHING IN THE MAIN MENU
7585,i am loving it
7586,Free overwatch
7587,"Paladins is the prime example of a game that is soured just by too much of one thing. Hi-Rez Studios is hyper focused on constantly creating new characters for the game instead of doing things like balancing previous broken or weak characters or even adding new maps. Paladins has 53 characters as I am writing this review and I have no doubt that it will probably reach at least 60 before it's shut down. Good luck keeping up with what these 53 characters all do, their abilities, how to use them, strategies against them and the various card builds and sub classes those 53 characters have. It's like someone gave Hi-Rez brain damage and now they can't go two seconds without making characters because that is all they literally think about. It makes sense why Hi-Rez killed its e-sports program because it would be impossible to do any type of competitive play in this Ringling Brothers circus tent of a game."
7588,THIS GAME IS SHIT NOT BALANCHED AT ALL
7589,its like overwatch but better
7590,"I hate this game because i played it so much and still die sometimes. It's the kind of game you hate then go on to play another match cuz you didn't play one character in a long time, wonder if ur still good with it, lose, repeat"
7591,"You'll be lucky if you ever get paired with teammates with more than two braincells to rub together. Matchmaking is absolute garbage and there is no skill based matchmaking. 

You will regularly (Almost every game), be paired with people who do not buy items, cannot play their roles correctly, and overall check out of reality and bash their heads against the nearest wall while drooling."
7592,Couldn't recommend it enough.
7593,Overwatch but it’s priced correctly.

7598,"It's like Overwatch, but not owned by Blizzard Activision."
7599,"fun but poorly balanced
"
7600,"Game used to be fun, in the past..

Too bad they made the game go to utter SHIT..
Bad servers, been like this for almost 2 years now, they wont fix it...
The matchmaker that has been broken since open beta. also will never be fixed
They are removing the fun things out of the game, like top plays, and game replays to ""fix bugs"" (it didnt fix anything)
Instead of balancing the game and fixing the main issues, they keep pushing out new skins and champions while the previously added ones arent even balanced yet...
Also making aaaalot of skins, trying to gain money from the dieing game.

Not to mention the toxic players (most players tht are left playing this game still)
casual games arent casual anymore, u will always be fighting 5stack teams that 4/0 stomp u, or the other way around.

It used to be gud, Servers gud, players nice, fun events, kind of balanced, matchmaking always been shit."
7601,trash
7602,yes very good graphics and runs smoothly and its PERFECT
7603,"Bad copy of Overwatch, beta used to be so good it never made me buy. I own both Overwatch and this crap and can say this is the worst of it. 6.5/10."
7604,best most tatical game ever! stick with it as high level players make all the diffrence
7605,this game is so fun
7606,"It's free
And Overwatch is dead
And no one got sexually harassed while making this game
So yeah, go play it"
7607,"Mixed feelings with this game. I played it when it was in Beta (2016) and it feels as unpolished as it is today. Hitboxes are weird, and the difference between old and new champions is just abyssmal. Although it is fun, it is not the staple of hero shooters, and it will never be as good as what Overwatch was in its prime. If you want to play this game, make sure you're not spending too much money in it, it ain't worth it."
7608,"Nice, non-violent, non-toxic casual shooter MOBA I wish there were more of such things

7632,nice fps game for enjoy with your friends!
7633,Free and casual. I play it mostly because all my close friends are scattered across different systems and this game allows us to connect with cross play. Big bonus for all the great looking and original skins.
7634,Fun game when it works. Lots of bugs in recent times but very fun ..cant deny that.
7635,vora

7648,"I'm not a lot into multiplayer games, but I can say truthfully that is really easy to get into this game, it's simple and addictive, and it's not like other shooters like Call of Duty where is hard to get into the multiplayer. This one is really helpful to new players, and at least you feel like you're achieving something even when you lose"

7656,"Paladins is one of the best free to play games available.
Only a few technical issues drag it down from being great. For example, sometimes it has so many bugs that it really goes on a person's nerves. However, if you are looking for a game that is like the Overwatch , I suggest you play."
7657,"steam asked me to revise this comment so i will, bad devs, bad character design most of the time, very unbalanced, lots of furries, and the currency system is bad. but it can be fun, there are some well designed characters, and i like most the mechanics"

Sketchy, broken, and waited 30 EFFING MINUTES ON A STUPID LOAD THAT NEVER WORKED! I have a good computer too, which is a problem as well. I'm gonna try to re-install for it to work."
7668,"SBMM is utterly broken even if you're unranked you could get matched with Masters and Grand Masters on the casual play which makes this game quite unwelcome to the new players and the rank game is full of toxic people that belittle you for not being able to play a certain champ even if you're adept at least 5 champs per class, this game is also bug infested game where the developer moved on to their other titles."
7669,"I find it disgusting the gayness that's occurring in this game. They push things like ""demisexual pride"" (whatever that is) along with many other bullshit ""pride"" terms. I think it's hilarious they sell the ""pride"" banners for 1 gold while any other real banner is 7,000+ gold, just proves they have to give them away for people to accept it."

7705,"If you are seeing this game and trying to convince them to get it by looking at reviews read this real quick. This game is an Overwatch clone but somehow is better than Overwatch. Its a fun 5v5 with interesting characters and decent combat. I played this with all my friends and we enjoyed the time we had, plus its a free game and looks actually very well. It runs like butter and is overall just a fun good for the night."
7706,It just works
7707,Very good free alternative to Overwatch

7709,"I played this much more on PS4. Bomb King, Maeve, and Pip main. 

I'm only writing this review cause my friend made a negative review about this being a cheaper Overwatch (He made the comment in 2018 so funny).

Try the game if you want. It has cross progression and cross play"

7712,"I am playing the free version of the game ,but still its bad and an off turning, when the game refuses to upload me in some matches, the problem might be that i don't have the access to certain maps obviously , so i cant join ,the game freezes and yeah its bad ,turns me off . hope someone would fix this issue"
7713,its fun and free!
7714,better ow OkayChamp
7715,Very fun game! would recommend it.
7716,"Honestly speaking its a great game if ur looking for an ability orientated overwatch like game
though it does get rough with certain comps where the counters are too hard which could just make u sit through an game  allowing u to do nothing  but atleast
 u could both play casual and competetive to ur hearts content without missing to much
but then again the devs are kinda lazy since there are a ton of bugs tht take a while to fix
and even some features get removed cus they couldnt bother fixing it like the potg(play of the game) feature

id rate this an 7/10 since its generally fun while it has its flaws u wouldnt regret putting some hours into it and even meet some nice members of its kind community"

Pre-made talents/abilities decks and auto item purchase make this an easy game to start and just have fun, with experience you can customize your deck and purchase to tweak your character for the specific battle at hand. I'm not a super fan of FPS (mainly b/c I'm a shadow of my younger self's skill) and this is playable and fun even for me."

7754,"I cannot conceive of a better team-based hero shooter. This game is one of the best I've ever played. It has options for just about every conceivable play style. The mobility options are respectable, and as a TF2 veteran, that's saying something. Definitely not as competent at bestowing mobility and empowering the player as TF2 is with its perfect mobility, but it's the best I've ever come across in any other game yet. I was introduced to this game with the bot crisis in TF2, and I've loved this game ever since. The balance team actually cares about the game! While the game is best enjoyed partying with your friends, I still highly recommend the game to anyone looking for a good time. There's definitely a bit of a learning curve, given the over 50 champions running around, but it's definitely worth learning."

Never have i seen a game turn to such garbage in such a short amount of time. Game balance is broken, match making is broken, there's still terrible hitreg and server lag because the devs are too poor to stop hosting servers on their laptop bitcoin mining rigs. 

If any devs see this please like consider getting a rusty knife and driving it into your eye socket."
7771,"Don't have Overwatch and a nice pc? Perfect, this game is for you. This game just isn't played enough. I recommend it to everyone, definitely a game worth playing!"
7772,"I came back to play recently and encountered a game breaking bug that wasn't letting EU players game. Thankfully it seems to have been fixed!

Paladins has been around for a long time, it's still really fun to play even with all the other shooters on the market. Don't let the large pool of champions put you off, you can learn them quite quickly and when you find ones you really like you can have fun mastering them.

The game is still supported with updates."
7773,cool
7774,"Great hero shooter game, it feels like a younger brother of Overwatch but in Quick Play is way more fun, due to the duration of maps, the quick play tend to be very fun and chill experience, the ranked is what you expect from a ranked game"
7775,garbage but its MY garbage
7776,"This game is really fun, and definitely worth your time! No character feels like another, and all bring something to the table, and will benefit you differently based on how each player likes to play. The microtransactions are for skins only, as you can purchase every character without spending any real world money. Although I did pay to get every character when they release, as it's a one time purchase that costs less than most games, and also is worth it if you're going to play this game a lot."

7817,Don't take this game to seriously and you'll have a great time.
7818,"the game is, like, fun."
7819,"Game is just kinda dwindling out. No diversity in players and poor development on updates is killing the game. kinda sucks now, no possibility to learn new champions due to the fact that the only people that play are extremely high level even in casual play, no ability for players looking to play a game for fun to pass time, only competitive play

Overall, I don't recommend this game to anyone not willing to spend countless hours trying to learn a single champion to use for the rest of their experience. A game I would only play with a group of friends so that you can play the same champions forever. 

Also every new champion is overly broken and OP. So play with your own discretion 

To top it off, there is a surprising amount of cheaters, with speed hacks wall hacks or aim-bot. It is often hard to notice but seems to be pretty prevalent (2 times in a single day). Very toxic community as well"
7820,"This game is not a poor-man's Overwatch, as some would have you believe. It is a Hero Shooter with Moba, Deck building, and Class Building elements rolled into one. I recommend this game to anyone who wants a good, competitive shooter."
7821,"I've played this game since the beta on PlayStation and have put a ton of hours into it. I recently have switched over to PC, and have been loving it just as much. I have always felt it has been better than overwatch due to deck builds and moba elements. Hope to see the game continue to grow."

7829,i got addicted and played for 9hr straight
7830,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
7831,ok
7832,Very fun game to play

7840,"fun when its open beta 
now not so much"
7841,This game is fucking shit.
7842,I initially played this game as a meme and also because after putting 800+ hrs into Overwatch I just wanted something new and this is it! Honestly its cheesy and I dont feel like I have to try that hard. Definitely recommend
7843,i like and enjoy the game
7844,"This game is awesome, it's pretty much a way better overwatch with way more characters,"
7845,"Trash game. it crashed 7 times, within 10 games only... I dont know what to say I cant play it it just keeps kicking me out or crashing. Waste of time"
7846,creaters cant even fix a bug who made random champions compliatli silent and make the game unplayable have random cheater who tleportig whit lian or other good thinks and a @@@@ evil mojo jojo cant even do anyting about it so it is a good game to torture yourself

7852,"This game has been enjoyable to play during its early times. Now, there are so many things that makes the game unbalanced. You know there's a problem when there are rankings for heroes not based on difficulty but based on whether they are good or bad. A well-balanced game will have situations when it is good for a hero and situations when there is not.
The devs should balance the game...and there are far too many bugs. Fixing the game is better than just adding content that breaks the game."
7853,Its just like overwatch except youre in a wheelchair with both your arms amputated and have your vision imparied by 80% and someone stealing money from you
7854,"really fun game,played it more without steam 5 years ago...but Hi Rez is doing everything they can to make this game worse and worse over time
-it didnt fail like their other cash grabs of rushed and porely made games like realm and the rest that died after a few months  so i guess they are doing a slow burn on this one so they can....kill one of their rare current games that people actually want to play? ? ? 
it is a mystery what retarded higher up in hi rez is doing this to the game
ignoring any feedback and just ruining any fun this game has and only focusing on HORRIBLY hard to get skins from shit chests and a hard grind to get anything
new item store/system and unbalanced azan is a prime example of a shit change no one asked but that clown forced the dev team to make

->the start is rough   you wont have any idea whats going on for the first 1-2-3 games  but then you will realise what the basics are and how to play
tanks contest point
suports not trying to only get kill but actually healing
flanks...flanking and not staying behind healers
damage doing damage,not to the new hard to kill tank ofc...

fun game but hi rez or evil are really trying to eliminate any fun or enjoyment from it"

7856,"Yal 100% hell no, community is literally non existent and toxic asf unless your a youtuber or a pro with other pro gc's. If you want to play with actual good people that don't suck absolute as- and actually work as a team you have to go into ranked which you then have to own EVERY single champion to even play DECENTLY as well as the fact of buying all of the champions which either you can pay a jack sh- ton of money for ""crystals"" or use the in game currency which on average you get about 300 coins per casual round and 2500 coins when leveling up which takes ages, and by the time you are able to even get ONE character it will be WEEKS, and not to mention the fact that if you want to be helpful in ranked you have to be really good at EVERY CHAMPION. Players in casual also either don't choose characters and end the match, spam click the character that they want to play as and then make you choose whatever role is left, or just choose a character that they suck at. Event passes are absolutely utterly useless and give you jack unless you pay for it which will also AGAIN gives you about absolute junk items and a cool skin plus a re-color of the same skin for a character you might-or might not have. ""I like this character i want a skin for it"" ok well there's the coin option and for the price of another champion you get one really either good-or awful skin!, if you want other skins that actually look good go pay a lot of money for crystals!!! ""I like these chest items"" welp too bad there are no coin chest anywhere so if you want a chest go spend your money on what?- Crystals... I have no issues with the game ITSELF (kinda) and i used to play this as a kid on my older brothers computer, it was MUCH better back then, the game itself is creative(you could argue on that point)-kinda with pretty decent(25% of the abilities suck as-)characters/abilities. Honestly this game is falling apart and the creators are just milking it for money at this point, its fun for like a month and then it just gets annoying after a while, same fancy skins for the same characters, same toxic as hell community, same junky hitboxes, same issues with bugs not being fixed :) Honestly if you want a better game with things like characters, community, story, gameplay, abilities, levels, and all of that, Warframe...don't need to elaborate much, honestly ion even like Warfame that much but its WAYY WAY WAY WAYYYY better then this...whatever THIS has become. Honestly i mean thank heavens this game is free, if it wasn't....it would still be the same review but worse. Honestly i got the game just to play Skye because she was my fav back then....its not even worth it for a character anymore...

7860,"Even though I have 55 hours on this game and enjoyed some of that time played, the game gets very repetitive, the microtransaction prices are quite pricy for what they offer, the battle pass tier up system is stupid, unfair, the rewards aren't really all that even though the pass is $10, the community has negative IQs as they all are very bad, and antisocial, the game also doesn't have an ""all chat"". The game really isn't good or fun, and on top of it all Overwatch will always be better even thought it's in an awful state, and if you can't compete with a dying game...you can't compete at all."

7887,"When this game came out, I was playing Overwatch. Now that I've stopped playing that, this game is a good alternative to that itch. But like most games like this, it's best played in spurts. I like the variety in characters, and the customizations you can do with their powers. Kinda wish you could get more skins with the in-game currency you earn, but since it's free to play, it's understandable. If the microtransactions help fund the game and keep it going, then I guess it's not so bad.

My overall experience match-wise though is always: Steam-roll the other team for a match. Get steam-rolled in the next match by a different team. Or vice-versa. It seems to be a rare occurence to get an equally skilled teams to go head to head.

Also not sure if they have this in their plans, but more maps would be nice as well. There's a somewhat good variety now, but more would be nice. :)"

You want the honest view?
It's like Overwatch but ""free""
I've invested money in it, but money is solely for cosmetics.
Game has many interesting and fun ways to play, each weekend having as special mode to play. However, the game is not updated and patched often, many characters have certain cards or talents that can make them unkillable, making the game an instant loss. The report system for those who leave the game or intentionally feed does not seem to do anything, even if all team mates report them. Some team comps make the game a loss from the start. Sometimes, it doesn't seem like skill controls the game, and rather luck and the characters who the team gets. Having no healer can mean loss immediately, same as no frontline, while those characters can be the worst to play.
I personally enjoy this game over Overwatch, but I can't recommend to others, especially those who rage easy. Many of my friends have raged quite hard at this game, and it sucks to see them get to that point.
Oh! And anyone who is a streamer, and puts it in their name, will troll and get the game to lose if they are on your team. They want the reaction, and it's usually the people who have 706 on one character."
7950,"When this game crashes (every few hours) you will lose ranked points no matter what if you were in ranked lobby. if you play badly or get focused too hard then people will say that you are ""throwing"" and report you regardless of what you say. they charge the same price for the battle pass every time regardless of how many skins/ items are in it. top play and kill cam were removed because they caused bugs and they didn't want to hire new engineers even though the amount of money people spend on this game is more than enough to not only pay their employees but to fix this games bugs and its inconsistency. basically no one has combos and the numbers go into the 1000's place. have fun if you can but don't expect an Esports career out of this game. played for 4000 hours across 3 different accounts for 6 years and the bug that makes your weapon seem like its auto firing and makes you unable to shoot is still prevalent in every other match i play. terminus is still broken. Tyra fire stays out after death but Bariks turrets don't. the software engineers that work this company just get free paychecks at this point. smite works. why cant paladins? what the fuck is realm royale? get real. this game has the potential to blow all other hero shooters out of the water and you sit here on a pile of gold using it as a toilet."

7957,"Game is full of bugs and terrible balance. Hi-rez is slowly killing the game (numbers of active players have been on a massive decline for a while now) and just pushing updates with more skins to milk the remaining playerbase of money. Bugs arent being fixed, every new update introduces a bunch of new ones (currently they added a new champion, while somehow managing to break the in game sounds and introduce a brand new bug, which kicks you out of your match and makes the game unresponsive for a few hours no matter how many times you restart it effectivelly not allowing you to play for hours when it occurs. I play casually as the ranked and matchmaking is dead and despite only the few times i tried playing, more often than not this bug would occur and render the game physically unplayable. 

This isnt a salty review, despite the company behind the game doing everything they can to kill it for the past few years, it has been a lot of fun, core ideas are imo better than overwatch with many resembling MOBAs (item shop, multiple builds and talents for champions, drafting, counters) all they have been doing for the past couple years was trying to milk the playerbase, making new skins constantly while ignoring the core game issues, introducing new bugs with skin patches and just leaving them there. 

It has got to a point where the few streamers and content creators who are left are quitting, player numbers peak at 5k and still dropping daily.

There really isnt anything like Paladins on the market currently thus it has been surviving until now. The state of the game is so horrendous i highly advise anyone considering playing it to not waste your time and play something else."

The main thing that sets this game apart from other hero shooters like overwatch is he custom loadouts, each hero has 3 ""talents"" which can change a feature of that hero or augment the heros abilitys in different ways and on top of that theres is a card system where u can change which parts u want to focus on in ur build like more health, more ammo, more abilty strength and receive extra health on abilty activation. All these small customizable features make the game that much more interesting give each champion multipule different ways to play them"

Just letting you know, love paladins, will always come back to this unique game. i hope this doesnt deter anyone from playing but definitely something urgent for the games health. thanks, merry christmas... sorry for long post :P

7987,"As a preface; I like this game. I have a few hundred hours into it, and I’ll get a few hundred more. 

However; 

Paladins is unpopular because, for a lot of outsiders checking it out, it looks like a cheap Overwatch clone with no thought or care put into it, and not many people are willing to jump into something popularly derided as a rip off a much bigger game. Most people would probably just say something like ""I'd rather play the original."" And for those on the inside it feels like a cheap clone with no thought or effort put into it. Im not saying it is, to be clear, but I am saying the feel of a game matters alot, and Paladins often feels like scorch garbage. Contrast this to Overwatch, a game polished to a very high standard, something I understand to be commonplace with Blizzard. Hell, they were apparently so famous there even used to be a phrase called ""Blizzard Polish"".

Now, I don't want to be one of those folks who blindly accuses the developers at Evil Mojo of not caring. (Im going to something semi-fresh and instead accuse the publisher, Hi-Rez, of not caring because they absolutely fucking don't.) But I am going to say that even if the developers from Evil Mojo are pouring their hearts and souls into Paladins, sadly, it doesn't really shine through. The game is falling apart at the seams. It has problems everywhere you look, from a shitty, barely functioning bounty store, to a matchmaker that seems to find the worst possible match-ups in history, to servers that die often you'd think they're powered by hamster wheels being tended to by poor mice that haven't been fed in 3 days.

Just because Paladins has had 6 champions shoved into it in the past year doesn't mean sqaut. Personally, I find the constant flow of new champios to be predictable and boring, and it isn't enough to keep me invested in a game that often feels like it's on its last legs these days. Paladins is unpopular because it often fails to feel like a living game which the developers truly care about. Again, Im not saying they don't, but all the words they put out about how invested they are in it won't matter to the average player when they log in, buy some skins, spend 10 minutes in a queue trying to find a match, having the server shit its pants halfway through said curbstomp of a game and they get kicked back to main menu and find all their skins gone."
7988,best game fo yo boroke intel hd graphics ass
7989,I dont know what am I playing but ok.
7990,"Really fun game, i have overwatch and paladins and idk... the free game is more fun!! what makes it so much better than overwatch is if you dont get a healer your still pretty much screwed, but its not an automatic loss, you have a chance to win because you can heal if you dont shoot for like 5 seconds. The annoying part about this game is the amount of stupidly overpowered characters *cough cough* pretty much all tanks. They are just annoying to kill, you gotta tell your team to target the tank, or hope they will have more than to brain cells and understand what to do.

TL;DR:
Fun game to play when your bored, but the op characters can get annoying to kill without smart teammates
8/10 i still wanna play after i die"
7991,"It's a great game that's a lot of fun. It can be a little buggy at times, like when I'm playing on Xbox (my friends list on XB has been broken for years)."

8003,Good Overwatch clone that is made by Hi-Rez studios better company then Activision-Blizzard. at least i can play this game without feeling guilt of supporting a big company who have been sexually assaulting their employees for years. Screw Activision blizzard!

8028,"Overwatch on Steam with extra-sexualized women. It's good fun, and high quality for a free-to-play game."
8029,The most dog shit game Iv ever played. Completely unbalance.
8030,"If you want to play a game like this, there is so many more like..
Tf2, Overwatch, Halo, Call of duty, csgo, etc

Literally all of the games above are way times better, especially if you want to play a shooter.
I don't recommend you play paladins mostly on it's not original design for characters and gameplay. Although this game had come out before Overwatch, it wasn't remade to be like the game you see now until after Overwatches premiere and release, also the game is cheap, the graphics suck and the crossovers too, literally the companies other game (smite) has Slipknot, Ninja turtles, Avatar, Stranger things and probably more, but as for paladins, they got like no crossovers except for RWBY a shitty anime for a shitty game, not even as well known as the other crossovers in their other game. This game also has the most shittiest engine ever, it crashes if you alt tab and there is probably more bugs I haven't found. So if you want to play a fun game, don't play Paladins, it's not worth anyone's time."
8031,"This game is very fun. It is fast-paced and team-oriented, and the customizable champions allow for a huge variety of play styles.  If you are looking for team-based, objective-based action, Paladins delivers.

However, there are some really bratty players in this game. People on your team will insult you and blame you for their own shortcomings. People will also drop out in the middle of the game if they aren't winning. It's not a great environment.

The monetization is also kind of whack. I totally don't mind spending money on a game I like, but I really wish I could just buy the character skins I want rather than try to get them from a random loot box."
8032,"BROKEN CHARACTERS NEVER GET FIXED

I am actually done playing this game, because of how broken Azaan is. He is frustrating to fight against. And Is a perfect example on how the devolopers deal with Broken characters: Just release a new broken character to combat against the previous."
8033,gay lil game ive played for too long
8034,Lag nhieu vc
8035,"I came from the world of Overwatch. Thousands of hours, always bashed Paladins cause it was a free to play. Decided to actually give it a try and haven't gone back. Game has 52 different champions all with their own backstory and play style. Trust me give this game at least a try you wont regret."

8043,overwatch but take away the balancing
8044,Games sucks
8045,"There have been so many times when an enemy is one shot but at the last second they teleport or use some stupid ability that let's them escape quickly or makes them invulnerable. You will lose that fight every time. And it's not like it's just 1 or 2 characters with those abilities, half the roster can do that shit, even tanks. Don't get me started on all the invisibility characters."
8046,"[b][h1]Paladins[/h1]

8048,the game is so glitchy and unbalanced
8049,"this game fvcking sucks. bad servers, crashes, weeb baiting, crashes, furries, crashes, random dumbasses playing azaan and ruining the game, and crashes. definitely haven't spent hundreds of dollars on this game or have 800 hours on xbox. that would be stupid. this game doesn't deserve a second of my time or a cent out of my wallet. if you are mentally ill and decide to play this game at all, please go play on console, you won't have to worry about crashing with every single input you make. only some of them."

8051,"The Game itself is pretty good and fun to play, but"
8052,gay
8053,"....
"
8054,this game is sus
8055,"Paladins is the 3rd best team shooter I've ever played. The designs are great, the controls are tight, it has way more to it than Overwatch, and it's free! Unfortunately, with the game being free, it has a lot of those problems the ftp model runs into. You have to grind an insane amount to unlock more champions, and the devs seem more focused on making skins than adding content. However, these don't feel like too terrible issues since the game is free, and you can buy all of the champions for less than Overwatch anyways. Its your standard team shooter fare, you have 3 gamemodes (usually, sometimes they have event ones) 4 roles in 5v5 matches. Queue is pretty fast, and matches are well paced. I've spent a lot of time on this game playing with my friends, and we picked it up again for the Ame voice pack. Overall, I think Paladins is a solid game and a great time with a group. If you want a game that'll last you forever, I don't think you'll find it here. My friends and I dropped it for the longest time, and probably won't pick it up again. But if you just want something to wind down on with some friends, its a great pick. 6/10"
8056,all the glitches. After further review i have noticed even more glitches so :)
8057,Positive review
8058,Like overwatch but newer

Other than that, this game is perfect in every aspect of how I've played it! I was recommended this game by a friend a year ago and I don't regret playing it! The devs of this game have my respect, and I hope they continue to do well with the game!"

8092,It's fun to play
8093,"Still not playable on Linux as of December 2021.
Beside the plethora of bugs n issues, the game still won't launch on Linux based OS's due to its AntiCheat.
Fix this ASAP or this game - which is already pretty much dead, especially when compared to any other major MOBA - will be left behind in the dirt with the release of Steam Deck and more and more users swapping off of the horrendous mistake that is Windows 11 (and any Microsoft OS shenanigans after).
Right now is the best time to swap to Linux, don't miss the train or you'll regret it."

8095,"Broke man's Overwatch, I also hate the match-ups sometimes"
8096,"i stopped playing the game more than 5 years ago and i was about to start playing again several days ago
but when i log in it seems they've unlink/unbind my old account from steam and asked me to create a new username, hence new account so all progress and skins and stuffs i bought ingame is just gone

so i straight up hit a ticket to the customer service and been replying the support emails with info and everything for several days
they said it's fixed and i can just log in again just to find out there doesn't seem to be any change
the account is still level one

there's not even a real logout button inside the game, you can technically click the log out button but then you can only press reconnect button and jump into that same account you just logged out since there are no other button

i was honestly genuinely looking forward to playing the game again with my irl friends again but then this happened
why do i even bother wasting several days for this
immediately uninstalled again friends also did the same
waste of time"

Developers that only care about money and nothing else.. pathetic game devs these days.. i don't get it why people are leaving good reviews when devs just cares about money, releasing new champions and skins instead of fixing a broken game with unbalanced champions.. stay away from this game at all cost, not worth playing even if it's free.."

8115,"Great Free to play game. Most of characters are fun to play as and is addicting. My ONE complain is the fact that my cross progression didn't work as I was expecting. In my PS account I had most of the characters and after linking the accounts not only like half of my skins were passed into my Steam account, but I will have to grind for the characters...AGAIN (I know I can spend some money to unlock all of them, but I rather unlock the characters I like). Good game.

I give this game a 8/10, is technically a 7, but I like it enough to bump it up to a 8"

"
8140,Me and my friends used to play this game and loved it every lunch time and freetime every time we get out of school we play this game but the one that turned us off in this game is the bugs that pushed us to play in pve instead of pvp since there are a lot of bugs in pvp and the constant update but no bug fixes even the bugs in beta are still in the game they dont fixed it.
8141,"it's overwatch, but if the Devs put passion into the character designs. 

10/10, not a pay to play.

Pros: Pretty art styles, cool skins/voice changing features, enjoyable and non-toxic

Cons: It can be pretty unbalanced with the new vs old characters, no one really communicates."

8163,played this game on xbox b4 and it is still so good.

I like to loose cuz I didnt pay attention or for lack of skills, not cuz my team were basically 10 years old pared against 30 years old seasoned NBA players. And I think the game has way too many exploits to make someone an unkillable god. Oh, and I met way too many people who were obviously were using cheats, like ones that let then see through walls. 

PS I had no issues with the fact that almost all characters are someone just copies of characters from LoL or Overwatch. I even like it somewhat.

Still gonna play it, but only with people I know."

8194,Honestly a good game. i just wish that it didn't have bugs that make you not want to play. I've been playing Paladins for years  and even though it has all those bugs its still enjoyable to play imho. Even ranked. Though i only play for the borders lol

8199,"Ive played quite a few Mobas at this point. None of em really had a champ that fit my playstyle. Paladins was the first which is Khan.
Paladins has some really unique ideas for champions and i think thats what makes it so special, some of them combine like 2-3 characters in overwatch packed all into one charming- or menacing character like Dredge or Yagorath.
Yes it came after overwatch, but that doesnt mean its bad just because of that. Its really worth checking out especially because it is free to play and doesnt have any pay to win advantages in the game at all."

8213,This game displayed on both of my monitors at the same time. I couldnt do anything. I pressed Escape but only the return to game button displayed. Windows Tab didn't work. Alt F4 too.

8216,"If one person goes afk or disconnects in the game, its pretty much a confirmed loss. Bots are broken af, matchmaking broken too. Sometimes the quests doesn't register. Ranked takes forever to find a match. Lots of times people disconnect before loading into the champion pick page, several times in a row even. And thats just things i can list off the top of my head."
8217,Trash game...Unfair and unbalanced characters and a lot of bugs.....dont play this game if you wanna keep your sanity
8218,Good game but don't lose your mind because of other players
8219,"[UPDATE]

Months after the ""stuck on game loading screen and unable to play for hours"" bug appeared, it is still an issue to this day ... unbelievable.

[ORIGINAL REVIEW]
Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is really fun, the characters and in-game graphics are great.
BUT ... the UI is so buggy and out of date ... it's like a game from 5 years ago. 
Also, I got stuck in the matchmaking an hour ago and I still cannot get to the main menu.
Developers should really fix the issues before majority of players leave.

Let's not talk about the character balance ... the newest character Azaan in just so OP even after a month."
8220,i like that this game is copy of overwatch but free
8221,Pip
8222,"As much as I love paladins and I'm addicted to the game- it is lacking, like, a lot.

I've spent over 500 hours and I'll list some problems with the game.
1. The matchmaking. It isn't functional and doesn't allow us to play properly. Whilst playing casuals, I sometimes get paired up with lower levels who don't know how to properly play while other times I get paired up with people who simply get all the kills in the game. It's very RNG even when it says that it ""depends on your elo"". Playing ranked is a whole another thing. Gold players get matched with master players and go against grand masters. It's so half-arsed and needs to be fixed as soon as possible.

2. The champions. Instead of focusing on fixing the balance of older champions, they just introduce newer ones. New champions are always way too overpowered and older champions just can't keep up. But once they get nerfed, they're unplayable but HiReZ doesn't ever touch them again. Old champions need work and they should focus on that instead of massively producing new champions and skins.

3. The bugs. There are way too many bugs in this game. There's a loading bug which hasn't been fixed for about a month and it locks hundreds of people out of their game for HOURS without a fix (except reinstalling it or waiting it out). I'm not sure why this hasn't been fixed yet and it took them over 3 weeks to properly address it even thought the bug channel in their discord has been overflowing with reports.

4. How they treat the community. The community isn't listened to and even tho they have a game insights team called AoC, no one knows about them nor do they promote them. They're supposed to be the connection between the developers and regular players yet very little people are actually aware of that. 

5. Playing ranked. This is more of a personal problem but when playing ranked I've encountered numerous amount of people who troll pick a champion or who just refuse to play, running around spawn the entire game. I'm not sure how it's possible for them to just be running around, doing nothing and when you report them, nothing happens. 

This game can be fun from time to time unless you figure out the meta and start understanding the game. It will frustrate you that people do not want to play or similar. I will say it's fairly fun to play it with friends but getting one random person in your team can ruin the whole day.

Sorry for an essay, I hope this helps someone."
8223,overwatch 3 is fun
8224,"after finish downloading paladin i cant even load the game i went to youtube how to fix the problem but it still dosent work, i tried re installing again but still dosent work"
8225,I can't quite grasp how this game goes from bad to worse with every single update. I guess props to the developers?
8226,ni
8227,alot of bugs
8228,"yeepers
"
8229,just fun
8230,"After playing hardly any of this game and way too much Overwatch during the pandemic, I can say without a shadow of a doubt or a hint of irony that Paladins is the better game."
8231,vora
8232,Literal dog water
8233,"This is not a perfect game. That being said it is extremely fun for anyone who likes shooters and team play. This was originally an Overwatch clone, but over the years it has become something all its own with frequent updates and patches for balance and to keep things interesting and fun. The best part about this game? There is ZERO advantage (besides maybe unlocking characters earlier) to throwing your wallet at the game. Your skill determines the win; everything else is purely aesthetic.

All in all, super fun and filled with heart pounding, adrenaline fueled firefights and cooperative endeavors such as escorting a siege engine to the enemy base or dominating a point. Also the classic of who kills who more. You can pick from 4 distinct champion classes which the various characters are divided into. The first class is damage (serious DPS guys). The second is flanker (fast and bursty, but usually very fragile guys). The third is tank (high survivability guys that usually have some kind of shielding ability). Last, but certainly not least, is support (your healers... mostly). Over 50 characters to choose from and master, but (and I think this is half the fun of it) you must unlock most of them by using gold (earned every match), crystals (earned by completing certain event things), or you can opt out of the unlocking process entirely and purchase them all in a big bundle. Personally I have never spent a dime on this game and I'm pretty close to having all the characters unlocked. Everything that is advantageous to winning is obtainable for free. There's no character you can only have by paying real money. The only 'pay exclusive' stuff are character skins, mounts etc. So you wanna play without getting stomped because some 11 year old's mommy bought him the deluxe best items and characters bundle for $169.99? Here ya go. Infinite replay value. No getting shamed by rich children."
8234,bad game
8235,HNAY
8236,"Good game with a variety of characters and game modes. A game that is not boring, tired of the character? no problem, take another:D"
8237,the game just keep crashing
8238,"the players in this game dont know how to play at all
you ask them to help you they just look at the enemy and are not shooting them
the game is full of 5 year olds"
8239,why wont it let me play paladins it wont even open
8240,its not fun and i hate it
8241,SIck
8242,good
8243,"I'm going to be comparing to Overwatch a lot, as most people view this game as the ""free alternative to Overwatch"". As someone that played both games, I can see where most people are comming from, but calling this game ""free Overwatch"" isn't really doing it justice. This is a great game that has similar gameplay mechanics and looks to Overwatch, but that's about it. The gameplay is quite different. I won't get into much detail, try it yourself, it's free! Now for the comparison. 
It's just about what you'd expect from a free game. Paladins doesn't have graphics as nice as Overwatch does, but that doesn't mean they're bad. There's also more bugs and the game isn't as polished as Overwatch is, but still, considering the price tag, it's pretty good! 
Since it's a free to play game, you can expect some microtransactions, but the game isn't limiting you in any way if you don't choose to pay anything. Microtransactions are basically only for cosmetics. When you start, you have just a few heroes unlocked, you'll have to unlock more of them as you progress. The gero usually costs 60 000 coins, which is, from my experience, roughly how much you make in a week, if you don't grind much. But as expected, you can unlock them faster, if you choose to spend real money. But again, even if you don't, you can still unlock all of them and it doesn't take forever. This mechanic is honestly something I'd like to see in Overwatch. When I, as a new player of Paladins opened the game for the first time, I had just 5 heroes, 1 for each class (except for support, which gets 2 heroes from the start). When I opened Overwatch for the first time, I was blasted with 32 characters that I could play right away and I was confused, I had no idea who I should play.
All in all, this is a pretty good game that deserves a better reputation than ""free Overwatch"".

8246,"its good

8247,"Dead game.... takes 5-10min to join a match.
And when you do it's a 30% chance that the game will get stuck while loading into a match. Making the loading getting stuck for entire day. Even if you shut down the game and try to restart it. It will throw you into a loading screen and after like 2-5 mins you are thrown back to main menu, but you can't click anything in there. So yeah....
Tried this for 2 days, but after playing 2 games each day, on 3rd game the same thing happened and now just uninstalled the game."

Didn't EAC add compatibility for proton? Why is this still a problem?"
8260,"The only thing this game has over TF2 or overwatch is gork nork the science orc

so 1/10 since there is one gork nork"
8261,This game is good but better with friends. But the only few problems is the way they try to get money out of you for a start 15 champions to play ranked what does not seem bad but its a long grind also i get that its a free to play but why tf do you have ads in it to only get 100 gold are we a joke. If you focus so hard on in game purchases and not on fixing the game whats the point.

8267,"Really fun alternative to Overwatch or TF2. Whilst the community is toxic and the matchmaking is average (most games are super unbalanced), it is still a really fun and unique way of playing an FPS. Each champion can be built differently with items to help counter the other team (as you cannot change champions mid-match like in TF2 or Overwatch). The graphics are beautiful, similarly to Overwatch, and the gameplay is almost flawless, despite a few glitches in maps. You do not need to spend any money to get the most out of the game either - most of the paid features seem to be cosmetics."
8268,sure
8269,Definitely only played like 3 matches after having to go into the files to fix the game because it wouldn't lauch so idk where the 17 hours of play time came from.

8272,"The selection of teammates / opponents is very poorly done. It seems that only one parameter is taken into account for the selection.
It is also absolutely not clear how coins are awarded for battles and for certain achievements.
In alerts, writes cosmic amounts of 2000, 3000, 5000+ coins, but in fact only around 100 - 200 coins are added. Yes, sometimes the specified amount is added in full. BUT this is one of 10 cases. And this is be very disappointing when you are trying to save up for a new character without donation.
The selection of teammates / opponents is very poorly done. It seems that only one parameter is taken into account for the selection."

8284,with this long into development its not an overwatch clone anymore
8285,"Mhm *cough* *cough*,So... i recommend it YES but~ there is a saying,If you want to start this game i recommend you first look at the guides or have a friend that already knows paladins so that he can teach you the basics,because in this game are players that do not like to lose,even if you want to have fun..,
Now.. let's talk about the game:
Game:The graphics are very enjoyable,the concept is addictive and by that i mean is a FANTASY competitive based game,that means if you want to roleplay and be freakin naruto or do anime fights...THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE
Let's talk about champions...:They have a story behind themselves you know..
I can feel that this game could have a freakin MANGA and an animated series about this ,seriously ...
You can deeply feel that this game has a story behind it no matter what...
I think there is a reason why they came to the realm you know... 
A competitive game having a story behind it is very strange and interesting,I'm lookin forward it,but anyway i HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!.seriously this game is awesome altough the brand that made the game has no interest in helping people if they get a bug,But ONLY if there is 1-20 people getting it,if there are MORE then they WILL TRY THEIR BEST TO REPAIR IT(That's what i hope so)...
COME IN IF YOU LIKE ANIME FIGHTS AND ENJOY THE GAME,But don't forget to know the basics first."
8286,fun game and good

8289,Could be a thumb up if Overwatch didn't exist. The last is just better in every aspect
8290,Good idea but poorly exacuted.
8291,"The free Overwatch clone, unoriginal review- but an accurate one.

Unbalanced so just play it for dumb fun, as in invite friends. Best plan is playing with friends on Overwatch because it's just better for various reasons, but it's not like it's the most amazing thing ever. So that being said it's up to you and your wallet on what you play.

6/10. A free clone, it's better than nothing and thus worth a try."

But now its even worse the game laggs while loading a match, kicks you to the lobby and congrats for the next 2,3 hours you cant play it cuz whenever you run the game it will try to put you in the match that cant even last this long???? I dont know how can this game can go backwards and get ruined. Its not like its a mobile app raise some money and fix your game ... how cheap and low can the hirez even go"

8317,"I  Play Paladins since 2017. What a shame they are generally destroying the game.  No point to describe the game situation since the developers don't care. If  you are new to this game, please don't even spend 1 euro for this they don't deserve."
8318,Get this game super fun and is free.
8319,Very humongous among us is chungus. Yes this fungus is so bungus.
8320,meh
8321,if you want a free fps shooter game that has abilities  like mobas and / or a game like overwatch then paladins is for you it also runs well on i3 4005u and 4gb ram so it runs well on harddrives/lowspec pcs its a good game but it has some bugs but no game is perfect and especially for a free game i recommend it especially if you cant afford overwatch or your pc cant run it. the game is similar to overwatch but there are differences you can buy items kinda like in mobas and you can also choose talents and loadouts and make different loadouts depending on your playstyle. you do have to buy champions though unlike in overwatch where theyre all unlocked but the good thing is there is daily quests you can do that give you gold that you can use to buy champions and also if you wanna pay real money u can get the deluxe edition for 60 usd and you get all current and future champions. overall its a good free to play game that i recommend

8329,This happened to my buddy Eric back in 02
8330,"At one time my review would have been different. But with dwindling player numbers, faulty servers, moderately unbalanced characters (with the exception of one: (Azaan)) Its hard to want to play this game. I've been playing this game since the beta, when the roster had roughly ten characters and I've never seen the game this far off from what it could be. Its a shame and I dont know where else to find a game like this that works as effectively as this one. Comment if you agree or disagree. Looking for any reasons to continue playing this game."

8340,"It was kinda fun the first few hours. Although most of the team mates I got would pick a healer and try to be a dps or would pick a dps and just hide and do no damage at all and I as the tank would have the most damage while the other team was always on point. Then the bugs appeared, the most fun part was when it found a game and while in the loading screen after selecting the character it took us back to the character selection screen and bugged. Closed the game then opened it again and guess what?! The map was loading, but it was stuck on the loading screen again. Closed the game a couple of times and still there... after it went to the main menu I couldn't click on anything so I had to alt tab and close the game yet again as alt f4 would not work. Well that was a fun experience... not!!!  Back to aram it is."

8344,"A realy good game, wondering why it isn't more popular."
8345,"I've never really been a fan of FPS team shooters. Granted, I grew up playing the original Call of Duty's, Battlefields, and Medal of Honors like most people. But I never got into Overwatch past the first few hours, despised the art style of games like Fortnight and slowly pulled away from the multiplayer genre of FPS due to the juvenile tantrums that started to infest the games. But for some reason, I really love the hell out of Paladins. 

Originally, I spent the opening years of it's release thinking it was similar to DOTA (don't know where I got that idea) so I avoided it. But a few of my friends were die hard fans and ended up talking me into it. I came in during the ""Dragon' season and since that time, I've made sure to complete all the season grinds.

PROS

Quirky and Unique: a lot of these characters are super similar to Overwatch's cast. But for whatever reason, I enjoy the Paladin crew way more than Blizzards guys. Can't really explain it. But I find each character way more fleshed out and interesting.

The Talent and Card System: This is probably what interests me the most and is the main reason I think I've stuck with this game for so long. There are three ways to 'build' your character. First is one talent out of three that will change some aspect of the character (aka buff one ability with drawbacks on others, increase speed at loss of damage, ect). The second is a card system. Each character has 5 cards tied to each of their unique abilities. The player is given 5 card slots and 15 points to upgrade the cards they put in those slots. What that allows is a deeper customization option than what Overwatch provides. Since I'm a hard core power dork when it comes to RPG style games, this scratches the itch. There's nothing better than taking a character the community thinks is complete garbage and crafting an effective build (Torvald and early Corvus come to mind personally for me). The third is bought 'equipment' in game. This allows you a smaller form of customization in game (thru an earned credit system based of caps and kills) to counter what the other team has on the field. I prefer this method instead of Overwatch's round swapping characters style. 

Pace: this game is fast paced, even compared to it's similar partner at Blizzard. The great thing is, though, it doesn't take a lot of thought. This is one of my favorite 'end of the night' drunk games. Get on with friends, play 5-6 matches, and then go to bed. It's enjoyable and memorable. 

CONS

Free to play: it is a free to play game. So monetization is everywhere. I still think they give ample ways to earn cosmetics and characters in game. Hell, they even have a daily sale feature which randomly chooses three things you don't have for like seven bucks. But it can be tedious for those who dislike the method.

Balance: all that customization comes at a price and there are characters who are simply stronger (at their base abilities) than their counterparts. But even with that, I have yet to see one character that is simply unplayable due to balance. There are some that require a shit ton of skill or a different way of thinking (Androxis is someone I will probably never be able to play as. Can not wrap my head around him) but overall I think they've done a stellar job at keeping all of the cast in roughly the same area power wise. 

Bugs and Lag: its a multiplayer, fast paced, shooter. Lag and the random bug happens. It's not overly bad (aka New World or Bethesda games) but for it being out so long, there are some that still probably should have been fixed by this point. 

If you're into the genre, I highly recommend this game. If you have a core group of 4-5 friends, I suggest it even more. It's a great game to bond over and have a lot of laughs with."
8346,"I can't recommend this game to anyone.The game is addictive but tottally broken.Unfair and unbalanced characters, tons of bugs, terrible coding in the game shop and they even raise the prices like they are doing great.This game is relaeasing new characters just to keep the interest of players while making it tottally unbalanced, unfair and with endless bugs.If you want to save your nerves stay out of this one."
8347,its free and really enjoyable
8348,Fun and challenging.  Still needed to balance some heroes but most of the mare well-adjusted.
8349,"This is insane game i wount recomend instaling this and add me if u want
my ussername:Alvien1010X"
8350,"pretty good, finally a free game that runs on low-end laptops, my laptop is a 200$ laptop, but this game still runs smooth."
8351,"I don't know from where to start. 
The game itself is enjoyable at some points. However, some characters are unbalanced and significantly stronger than the others. You see them getting nerfed in the next update but instead, some weak characters suddenly turn into nonstop able machine killers. 
The community could become toxic at some points as well. It is not something that you want to get involved into that much. 
Also, let us not forget about the unfair ranking system, unpunished toxic folks or griefers."

8363,good game. needs a grind at start to get fun but after that its one of the best games
8364,It's ight.
8365,"I play it from time to time because I play with friends. 

LOTS OF BUGS
 I had a bug in which our match got stuck and it locked up my account and I couldn't play any matches anymore. This is one of many, but certainly unacceptable. Maybe they want the game to die, I don't know.

BAD MATCHUPS
 There are only a few players left on the server so if you play normals, the odds that you will end up matched against masters, diamonds and golds are standard. Heck, I write this review after my friend and I played a game against a lvl 999 and his buddies in gold with levels 300 to 400 and we got our asses beat up more than we could even receive. I wanted to give up, to go afk but I didn't want to surrender to the horrendous matching system. 

I know I am not a good player, I am not here for that. I am here for having fun and playing casually. But it's so frustrating to play against teams that destroy you time again and again. I really haven't had any fun dying constantly the second I get seen.

UNBALANCED CHAMPIONS
 I don't know how this is still a problem, honestly, but there is some really idiotic game design applied in here. Champions can be invincible. I am especially talking about ZHIN, it's a champion so broken he doesn't even care. You might ask about what of his abilities? He becomes invincible. For more seconds at a time. He even has some card that prolongs that invincibility time. That is literally so STUPID. 
AZAAN is supposedly a tank but that man is so hard to kill and does so much damage he literally is an assassin, a tank and a damage dealer at the same time. He is really hard to kill, has a passive that protects him from % of damage you deal to him. And on top of that, he does a ton of damage. And the most annoying ""feature"" is he is literally modifying the map. He can place some type of walls down for a moderately amount of time and nothing will go through those walls, baby. You can try to destroy the walls but they soak up so much damage you better have your grandpa's patience. It really breaks the flow of the game. Yeah. Talk about bad game design. 


It's a shame because this game was really fun when technical problems were not a constant presence. I guess they want it dead anyway. 

So far THIS is the state of the game as of 14th of December 2021."
8366,it's fun played on switch and pc not so often tho but yea its pretty fun similar to overwatch in a way ig?
8367,not works
8368,ggg
8369,nice
8370,"I love this game, but there is no functional controller support. It works 80% of the time only. Sometimes it just won't work at all, and other times it would work completely fine. I tested it with 2 different xbox one controllers the game will stop responding to my controller input mid-match for no apparent reason, but it would let me use the controller for the menu only (thanks I guess..?), so i tried changing the controller input to 'controller', guess what happened.. it tells me you can't do that mid match even though I started with a controller! anyway eventually you'll get kicked out of the game over and over, and get reported by your teammates for being AFK! I believe the game came out around half a decade ago counting the early access period.. how is this still an issue? I have around 1k hours on this game and played it on different platforms. It's super fun when it works but there will always be a few game breaking bugs like this and the one on the switch where you'd get disconnected for no reason. BTW, you can't just quit the game and go back and look for a new game, it will keep throwing you in the same match where you can't use your controller. (Again I have multiple good controllers and this happened with all of them at least once, i tried it wireless and wired, it does not matter). If you are a gamepad player, avoid this game if you don't want an afk ban, because, believe me, this will happen to you sooner or later, multiple times. I'll change the review if this gets fixed. 

Lastly, I thought it's maybe because I was only allowed to play on controller only servers but no, my option is set to (Allow all input methods), so I don't see why I can't change the input method mid-game."
8371,this game has as many bugs as skins like ive had to uninstall the game on multiple occasions due to an infinite loading bug the game can be fun but its completely unbalanced and the devs dont care all that matters is their shitty fan service skins and getting butt load off it plz do your self a favour and dont play this game
8372,easy game

8380,its pretty fun
8381,Very nice game
8382,"Game is pretty fun! If you don't like overwatch then this game will fit you perfectly. Its similar to overwatch. Gameplay wise is better and more enjoyable compared to overwatch in my opinion. Reasons for that are firstly, because there are a card system, which offers your champions to adjust to gameplay like extra buffs you can say, which are fun to use. Secondly, yes before you guys say ""Oh yeah its overwatch copy but worse"" please firstly I would give it a chance. Thirdly yes there are bugs in the game, however most of them were fixed, so you can enjoy the game without worrying. But yeah in summary play the game, if you don't have anything else to do and you look for something to play and yeah characters are pretty much fun to use and with card system, it's even better as it allows you a variety of different builds to make champions useable in more than one way! I hope you will enjoy the game."
8383,"Hi Rez never knew how to create matchmaking for their games, this on is a perfect example of it. You will never learn a thing as the games are one sided always wether on the stomping team or being stomped it's the only thing that happens."
8384,"More of an Overwatch guy, having 450 hours in Overwatch across 2 accounts. Overwatch is dying of lack of content so this serves as an okay replacement for the time being, it will always be inferior to me but that's okay, this isn't Overwatch, its a game that does a lot good, but a lot of afk players"

8406,"I first played Paladins about 5 years ago, and classed it as a poor mans overwatch.  At the time I lover overwatch and played it  a LOT.  I then was convinced to give it another try about a year later.  To my surprise I got hooked.  Yes the games are very similar, but once you learn the characters and slight differences, the card system and items add soo much more to the game.  The characters have added more and more and now I just cant go back.

It is a great game, you just have to give it a fair try.  The one thing it does lack is the limited time story style events which overwatch is great at implementing."
8407,Who even still plays this game lmao
8408,woman big bonker my peenor go zoinkers
8409,"very easy and very fun
"
8410,"A large amount of the characters are either broken or just badly designed. This make it very rare to have an actual good match. If one or more of the 10 players get broken/bad characters, the game devolves into annoyance or boredom."

8433,"its fun and some interesting characters, great game lol"
8434,"I haven't many hours on pc, but many on consoles such as switch. Here's my review:

It's terrible. Don't get it. All you'll do is say ""Hey this is a pretty good game! It's like Overwatch but better!"" And then you'll play it, and love it, and eat it, and live by it, and start to literally DIE. You'll have nightmares of the characters consuming your character and pooping your character out. You'll start to slowly become a deformed turtle with 1 giant eye and 1 smaller one, and only say Koga's line ""you're already dead."" and only eat spaghettios and chesse wizz by the can. 

                                                               Yeah you should get it. 10/10"

8439,"Certainly better than over watch, has aged better and really is a game that opens its doors for all who have ever enjoyed FPS or Hero Based combat games."
8440,"it used to be a great game, but as it is today it's just a shell of its former self. To this day the developers did some good but it's completely forshadowed by the negative things: it's completely unbalaced and there are character that literally destroy any match; the majority of buffs and nerfs are useless or harmful to the game itself and on top of that the only interesting character to play added ""recentely"" is Vora, all the others are furrys, which is a style problem but seriously?, and aren't anything new, basically other characters reskinned"
8441,fun game
8442,"This game is one if not the most cancer game ive played in a long time. The devs clearly dont give a fuck about the game, they release new champs that are completely fuckin broken, the servers are bloody dogwater, theres is legit no fuckin matchmakin at all, itll put you up against sweaty neckbeards that play this cess pit 24/7 even if its your first time playin, and a shit ton of people youll meet will be toxic cunts who get pissy if you dont pick a tank or healer if the team doesnt have one, even in fuckin casuals and best thing yet, I heard the pissy shit devs get so butt hurt about people callin there game shit they ban people who do it, and idk if thats true or not but if it is I hope to god they ban me so I dont have to spend a second longer on this disgrace of a game

8483,"where to start lol. i don't play very many games so i don't know how much weight this review will hold, but this is a very fun game. i love the fact that you can cater the character to any play style you desire using a combination of the talents and the cards and... that's about it. the game is a fun game but it is rife with bugs (the latest of which is a sound bug that has made it INCREDIBLY unfun to play), the balancing is VERY questionable, and the community can, at times, be... [redacted]. i would recommend it, soley for the purpose of experiencing it, but PLAY IT LEISURELY; every once in a while, every couple of weeks, etc. if you play it too seriously and too consistently, your frustration with the game will ruin your experience."

8485,"if u dont have overwatch, this is the best game to play. In fact,its more exciting and alive than overwatch"
8486,"Pretty fun with friends if you like overwatch but don't like the players actually knowing how to play the game then come play paladins, i dont know if its my level or what but the people playing this game are all just I dont even know its like they are bots but they aren't, imagine like a cat walking across the keyboard and its chasing the mouse on your desk and its just awful but occasionally by some sort divine intervention the cat clicks the mouse and hits the right keys that their character in this game(That they probably dont even know they are playing cause like they are a cat) kills somebody elses cat playing the game, it was pretty funny to watch tbh

I rate pretty good/good I guess"

8508,"unbalanced af, graphics are early ps2 era, sound is awful, hit detection is awful, only reason to play the game is that overwatch is slightly more garbo than this.

bounties tied to bot games and uses easy anti cheat. One of the worst anti cheat so expect a lot of cheaters. worst servers i've ever played on. The delay/lag spikes/unsynced actions are just abysmal. free is the right price for this."

8519,This game sucks
8520,"really fun to play, however your partners in this game sometimes are a bit ""silly"" so it is better to play with friends."
8521,"Damn I love this game. All the champions are balanced and there is a large variety of champions, playstyles and customization. Like for example you can play a flank as a healer or healer as a flank just by building a different loadout and talent. I enjoy playing this game!"
8522,its cul
8523,I chose yes.
8524,"I really want to give this game a 10. I love it. But there is just a few issues that need sorting....

*Horribly unbalanced and when playing comp, the lobby times are horrendous. 
*There are only a handful of maps in general... like 6 or 7... if you are TDM lover, i hope you love the choice of 2 maps XD
*so hard to get bounty coins! the amount they offer you for completing quests is actually a joke. skins are like 4000 - 8000 bounty points, but the bounty quests will only give you like 65 bounty points
* AFK players makes me so mad, coz if they leave, a bot replaces them. but if they just sit there they wont disconnect.... soooy annoying. also there is no option to leave game. you can only close the game, but if you open the game up again, it will auto load you into the match you left.

there are a few good points tho.... 

*its free to start XD     also if you have spent coins to buy characters, and then you buy one of the DLC character packs, the characters you have paid for with coins that are included in the pack will be refunded to you, which is sick coz you can then buy a few basic skins or other characters. 
*Cross platform, enough said, all the boys can play! (or girls)
*huge roster

All in all i would say definitely  give it  go, its free after all. and wait for a sale and that character pack usually goes down to like $8 ish. pretty worth the money in my eyes.

pro tip: DONT step into the light XD"
8525,tf2 engineer
8526,Pretty Fun but if you dont like grindng for items or characters this game might not be for you since characters are a little expencive at 60000 or 30000 while some are 15000 but pretty good game daily mssions help with the gold grind gud game would recomend :))

8530,"dumb characters, dumb monetization, dumb shit"
8531,"We Need to bring paladins back man, yes it has its problems from time to time, but the gameplay is fun, flashy and solid. Its reliable, new champions mix things up without ruining the game, if we can all just bare with Hi-Rez they can give us the game we need.
Learning curve isn't much and you just get better with time. 
IF Hi-Rez wants to save their game they need but implement the following.

Make most skins directly purchasable with crystals: entice players to play the game not force them to play for scraps
or grind battle passes.
 
Make draft pick a thing, teams are often unbalanced and people just don't know how to function sometimes
make people select roles they can Queue with in ranked, builds are fluid enough to still have diversity this isn't overwatch. Talents and loadout cards can make champions and roles versatile. however if we still need a structure

If at any point you can, Bring back the pro play, Mixer was a investment we lost, just stream on twitch and maybe try and get a twitch rivals Tournament or something similar. This game has good heart and flavor, don't forget that. 

and In my personal Opinion: STOP MAKING DAMAGE CHAMPIONS WE NEED TANKS AND SUPPORTS TOO!
instead try and spice up damages with visual reworks or give them new tricks, I very much enjoyed the changes to sha lin. 
Also i miss the cinematics, they were cool as hell.
the player base is dwindling and its just sad

Hi-Rez
Bring back my Paladinos
Ok?
I have had so many great memories with this game, i met some of my closest friends through here, and to this day we all want this game to come back.
also player base, come back you are half the reason this game is dead in the first place."
8532,"You can be stonewalled @ your base and held hostage while your game never ends due to no objective being met.

8535,i started hating this game. bunch of afk players with no serious penalty.
8536,good
8537,better than overwatch but free
8538,QUE JOGO DA PIROCA!
8539,"Paladins is a fast-paced hero shooter which requires a heavy reliance on teamwork to succeed (if you're in ranked, lol). For casual play, I would recommend either queing with friends or sticking to TDM, because a large portion of the casual audience will just pick champs w/o regard for whether or not they are building a good team comp (such as 4 separate players all instantly locking in damages/flankers, leaving no room for a support and tank). 

I tried Overwatch, but didn't enjoy myself nearly as much because it does not offer customized play like Paladins. If I pick Ash in OW, she plays the same as EVERY Ash that I will ever face. However, I'd I pick Androxus in Paladins, I can select a loadout that buffs his movement speed and distance traveled by his dashes, or i can make another that focuses on ammo regen and a shorter cooldown on his Reversal. (this is a super simplified explanation, there's a lot of variance to loadouts). My Androxus will also have 1 of 3 talents, which alter one of his abilities to change his playstyle even further. One changes the way his pistol shoots, another adds guaranteed damage to his Reversal each time he uses it, and the last option makes his melee punch have greatly increased damage. 

Additionally, as with every hero shooter, there are different classes: Flankers focus on movement and getting in and out quickly to secure kills, Damages excel at (duh) dps, Frontlines have large health pools and abilities that are good at negating/blocking damage, and Supports focus on healing their allies and providing other buffs/debuffs to allies/enemies. Each class has roughly 10-15 champions. So between the loadout and talent system, classes, and champions, there's probably a way for all FPS fans to enjoy this game :) I hope you'll give  it a try!! :D"

8560,"I played this game quite awhile ago. I was pretty good at it. I usually queued up solo for ranked. I got frustrated by the matchmaking placing me on a team with all competent or all the opposite of competent team members. The game was just a steamroller one way or the other for each match. I suppose now with a smaller player-base that the matchmaker's uncanny ability to not balance teams would be more pronounced. I'm writing this review because I was thinking of revisiting this game. I just remembered why I stopped playing and wanted to memorialize it. Nonetheless, When I played, there was no pay to win aspect, but as usual, some characters were better than others."

8584,Best game
8585,"fun to play with friends and very competitive
"
8586,"While I love this game I feel obligated to say that this game is unpolished, riddled with bugs, horribly imbalanced, characters are overpriced (10$ or like 10+hrs of playing to get a single character), and a variety of other problems. 

That being said this game does fill a surprisingly underrepresented aspect of the character shooter genre and that is a focus on casual play. You find a character you like design wise? Congrats you can now play them in basically every role, no, I'm not exaggerating. This game puts a large focus on customization so you can alter each character's playstyle in massive ways, allowing you to play however you want and be effective if you get good at it, I used to play a squishy support as a cooldown-reliant dodge tank and found huge amounts of success doing so.

Ultimately, if you're looking for a competitive, balanced, and polished game as is the norm, you will not find it here, this game is the antithesis of that.
However, if you're looking for a chill, turn your brain off and press buttons game this one is for you."
8587,took 3rd to 1rst person away because of sweats peaking corners in comp. was fun till it wasnt . love not seeing my character and skin for them
8588,Not bad
8589,"The game is wonderful but here's the pros and cons in my opinion 

pros
1. fun game tons of heroes to choose from
2. fun gameplay for each champion
3. cool skins and new champions

cons
1. While I've met some good people in the Paladins fandom some are leftist liberals who really love to fight and start conflict and drama if you call them out on their flaws then it's a huge fight.
2. game does have bugs and glitches 
3. Game isn't too skillful it's a little skillful but for the most part the hitboxes are huge and you can hit players very easily."
8590,you like overwatch youll like paladins
8591,I like so much this game and recommend to other players.
8592,game would be a certified lover boy if the servers weren't so dog poo and if match making would actually let you fight people on your skill level
8593,No
8594,buggy piece of crap
8595,"Matching and pairing system sucked, characters are extremely imbalance, bad in overall I would say. Sorry, that's a NO for me."
8596,ow clone LUL
8597,it's basically free overwatch

8630,"classic game, when i was playing this game i was at a point in my life where things werent going so well, i ran my dog over by accident, my girlfirend cheated on me with my best friend, perple at school make fun of me, i permanantly damaged my chest and heart from over training and i can only do cardio or leg workout, my girlfriend that cheated was pissed at me and got me deported(i still love her) and they took me to the congos and im not even an illegal immigrant, when i was at the congos i made friends with pygmies and they gave me baboon brain and i ate baboons with them, i had a really nice time with them it made me forget the trouble i was in, they gave me alcohol, it didnt taste very pleasant, it tasted like acid, hours into getting drunk and dancing with them naked i ended having sex with 2 pygmy girls, they were flailing their genitalia at me and were smiling at me, and im a pretty horny guy so i took the oppurtunity, i started buttsmashing them with my meatman blade at the same time and the pygmies seem to not care, i had a great time, then everything went to black and next thing i know i was in the backseat of a moving car still naked and was pushed out of the car and on to my frontyard (guess the us department of homeland securtiy realized their mistake) i was conscience at the time but a little dizzy, i went into my house and immediatly smelled the smell of my house, it felt great, if only i had my stash on me at the time it would of been perfect, so i went into my living room turned on my xbox and had an all night session of paladins, 10 of 10 great game, without a doubt i will show my kids this game"

8634,pretty cool game to waste ur life away to
8635,"the game itself, not many complaints (besides champ balance but it is a hard job i admit) 

but matchmaking does it for me, when the game first released it was kind of obvious
(you win alot, your team gets worse)
but the terrible happens after u win with terrible teammates
(it starts putting u into cheating lobbies)(while still giving u trash teams
(i know this because when u watch them they are tracking u thru walls, never miss a shot, etc)

sure good people can win more often and bad ones can lose more often, but if 90% of my games are decided before i start then no thanks."

8657,PLEASE STOP MAKING FURRY SKINS
8658,"nice just fix the servers!!
"
8659,"This game is good and i love the chanpions, combat and the game when everyone play their roles
but the only problem is the grinding, took me 3 days to get a new champion and hard to get any good amount of gold despite leveling up so it made me quit the game because i cant rlly afford to grind 3 days again for a single champion well it depends on the champions that i want to by beside dat the game is good just the grinding sucks"

8677,"Been playing since OB63 on ps4, sad to see the game in this state. In 2022 I hope they stop releasing champions and focus on the servers for the 1st two months at least. Otherwise people wont stay."
8678,"all the champions are realy well developed!
requires real teamplay to win matches.  Very balanced game , easy to learn, hard to master."
8679,"As a person who has played both Overwatch and Paladins (but admittedly more Paladins) I would say that this game is still fun in comparison to Overwatch. I see this issue appear lots between fans of both games and I personally believe that both games have their upsides and downsides. I personally love the customisation which this game has to offer, which allows every character to be played completely differently from game to game by using different talent and load-out cards and even different items! I think this adds lots of strategic depth to the game, other than just ""whoever can aim the best wins."" I also think it has a very diverse range of characters, which wonderfully fill the four roles in the game (damage, flank, frontline and support). Despite this, I do understand where issues arise with the game. Firstly is that there is a defined meta, which certain characters are weakened by and certain excel in. But why not just pick the best character? Well this is where the issue of character unlocking is presented, since certain characters need to be purchased using coins or gems in the game which can be either very hard or virtually impossible to gain without spending real money. This makes the game very pay to win, allowing players who spend money on the game to have an immediate advantage. This gap can be overcome with enough time in the game however, since eventually you can unlock every character you want naturally. As stated prior, at certain times there are defined metas, where certain characters may be too powerful or not powerful enough. Overall it is a very good game however... and it's completely free to play!"
8680,if u like overwacth

8683,"Personally, I'd say this game is the next Overwatch.

Although sure, they are lacking so many things that Overwatch has, this game is much better in my opinion for various reasons.

1 - More champions/characters to play. 

We get around 3 - 5 champions (heros) each year and a good amount of maps along that as well. 

2 - More playablity.

This game has things called ""Talents"". Talents are basically special powers or extra skills you can use to change the playstyle. You can choose one out of three different ones at the start of each game.

These could vary from an extra healing charge for a healer, giving the healer more damage. Or ""executing"" (one-shotting) an enemy at or under 35% HP using a specific character, heal other players while using a specific move, and so on. 

The game also has these things called ""Loadouts."" Loadouts are a set of 5 cards that you make which changes things about the character. More HP, shorter cooldowns, extra range on moves, more ult charge, etc. 

Each card can go up to 5 points. To have a usable loadout, you need it to have 15 points maximum.

3 - Cosmetics.

For example, gold skins. In Overwatch, gold-skins are only available for your weapon. While in Paladins, the game allows you to get gold-skins for your entire character. Changing the color of the moves, the color palette of the champion to gold/black/light-purple. etc.

Also, there's a LOT of skins in this game. And you can also combine multiple skins! For example, I can use this skin that changes the color palette of the champion and then take the gold-skin for the weapon. Ending up with an interesting and unique look for each champion.

I could go on and on about this, but I feel as if this is more than enough. :)"
8684,If you're looking for a free alternative to Overwatch.
8685,yes
8686,yes very good lol its like over watch but free
8687,its good
8688,"Good game, wonder how this game outlast Overwatch 1.
Overall good load out/talent system to enable different play style.
"
8689,"This has to be the most fun multiplayer gane ever, but it seems Hi-rez is Paladins Greatest enemy the devs are killing this game rather than promoting it, filled with bugs, the UI is messed up every now and then you have to face bugs, Character that needs skin doesn't get much skins yet character that have alot of skin keeps on getting skins, even their website is lackluster Also too manyMany hackers . All of this together killing this game, nevertheless I love this game It has the potential to  be one of the best multiplayer game of all time (from fun perspective not competitive wise though it is still alot competitive )"
8690,good game farewell
8691,i bought cystral used it on the good vide chest got remix pepper just for the game not to let me use it even tho i own it and now it says i dont have it and it didnt refund me!
8692,its a fun game but i would like the refinement of certain things
8693,i like it
8694,good stuff kind of slow progression. nice rip off game tho
8695,"I VERY LIKE THIS GAME , AND PALADINS IS MY MIDDLE NAME , IT'S MEAN BIG D :)"
8696,I love this game!!!
8697,"I have more than 1000 hours on this game, playing since early Betas. The gameplay is amazing. The characters are very cool. Skins are awesome. However, the company that manages this game seems to not care about it since a long time. They don't make quality of life changes, they don't support content creators, they don't try to build a community around the game. There used to be big championships in the past, but today there is nothing. Playing this game alone feels sad these days. Playing with friends is still nice. But overall, it is a nice game that I recommend having as secondary one. My main FPS right now is Apex Legends, so when I need some break from the Apex's grind this is a good choice. So, I don't recommend picking this game as a primary game, where you would put time and effort to be great at, but it can be a fun secondary game. Just play it for fun and have in mind that this game will probably die soon if Hi-Rez keeps making the same mistakes."
8698,good
8699,"Addicting gameplay, abilities, and characters. It's a great alternative to Overwatch because it's free. Plenty of room to tinker with character builds and that's what really shines about this game."
8700,"It's trash that you, you know? Like to keep around? -Seth 2021"

8754,ok
8755,meh..
8756,This is an amazing concept that was poorly managed and has been struggling ever since. This game is the best on steam when you play with Friends. Casually and with some form of Communication. Playing without friends exposes you to some terribly annoying and toxic people during the course of thousands of hours of gameplay
8757,+1
8758,these hoes thick AF
8759,+1
8760,play it BUT only with me add me if you havent and if i dont add you back i give you full consent to tracking down my ip address and hunting me down
8761,"After all these years still a broken game, with bots walking into walls, toxic players (eg if you beg for heals your OWN team spam ""help"" or ""heal me"" just to mock you, but that's westerners/white people for you)

So broken the voice chat is still not working after 5yrs and more (for the best i guess, at least i can't HEAR the toxicity, unlike overwatch) however the characters and play style is broken. It uses items you can buy from a SHOP (a gimmick) buy cauterize and you cant' heal making self healing characters such as khan (a tank) useless i.e why even have that ability if its just negated?

The dumb players will also get butt hurt if you don't buy it ""duh we're losing because you didn't buy caut"", i hear the same ""excuse"" in overwatch during its early days ""duh we don't have a healer thats why we lost you idiot"" when the POTG clearly shows people dying due to bad aim and just standing there AND i've won games with NO healers or dps etc....EXPLAIN THAT!?!? i.e caut is just one of those excuse to blame someone for being bad at a game (fyi i've one games without buying caut before)

Other broken things are heroes, evie is a mixture of tracer/dva/mei, picture a character that can blink in a hemisphere i.e any direction and that INCLUDES in the air making tracking impossible (not to mention the game allows for healing using ""loadouts"".

Loadouts are cards that determine your play style, however they are usually pointless

For evie though, with the right loadout she can blink, reblink (without waiting for cooldown) so its like tracers recall (i've seen it done twice) her ult can be done twice aswell, the ultimate is worse then meis freeze, yes you can still shoot but you're slowed, you can't use a movement ability as it blocks all abilities. If you manage to exhaust her moves she flies long distances (like dva but the distance is GREAT!!)

Tanks have take damage (which is logical you don't want them to kill everyone like a damage character,) however sometimes they can be so weak that you can forget clutching a fight eg reinhardt in OW, one shatter plus great play means a ""comeback""

Every tank looks unbalanced if you compare them to each other eg barik (a counterfeit torb from OW) turrets die fast dealing little to no damage, his shield takes ages to cooldown and EXPIRES!! 

Then there's Ash, she's like barik but bigger shield, hard to break, i think it lasts forever aswell, and her hp is so hard to bring down that even if she stands still you can't finish her off easily

The upside to playing paladins is its free, but you know what that means microtransactions, ages to earn free money to buy your heroes as they are not all available, in australia competitive servers are practically dead

RANT ABOUT HATE/TOXICITY IN DPS GAMES: 

Unless you're playing in a asian country then be prepared to deal with western stupidity
i.e tacism/sexism/toxicity, overwatch only seems worse due to it having voice chat and this? lol so many years and they still haven't even fixed voice chat in paladins. No one heals no one cares about you, speak up and get abused

People always blame a game community eg ""LoL has the most toxic"" community ever, but its a culture thing, in overwatch you get bullied for NO reason and they tell you they r@ped your mum or say racist black or asian slurs, because western culture is like that

EXAMPLE: yvonnie from the streamer house ""offline tv"" was sexually harassed in LoL she told them to stop and their response was ""get over it"", now lets look at asian cultures example japan, there's youtube footage of vtubers (hololive jp) of a female player flirting (jokingly) in the game APEX and the other guys were gushing over her in a respectful way, even the youtube comments say ""wow, all i get is toxic racist players in my game"" this is proof im right!!

rate 7/10 
can be fun but its a pretty broken game, and if people make you bad don't even argue back, western culture LOVES hate, they'll just type ""lol"" and gang up and harass you with your OWN team or tell you to uninstall, just leave. The upside to leaving in paladins is no punishments unlike overwatch. OW punishes people for leaving and you not longer can see ""past players"" making reporting previous players for bullying impossible"

8790,fun game

I'm a man of culture, I'm sorry.

8807,"Go ahead, try this game, it's free. It'll be fun up to a certain point until you start to get annoyed by the bugs, balance, broken decks, grinding etc. This game got worse during my playtime and I don't know if it's getting any better.

PS: Moved to Overwatch lol"

8849,"I can't recommend this game to anyone.The game is addictive but tottally broken.Unfair and unbalanced characters, tons of bugs, terrible coding in the game shop and they even raise the prices like they are doing great.This game is relaeasing new characters just to keep the interest of players while making it tottally unbalanced, unfair and with endless bugs.If you want to save your nerves stay out of this one."

8856,good ig
8857,it good. monkey brain like violence. Watch fiends go pew pew while I keep them not dead. :3 would recommend. 10/10
8858,"Beside all the glitches, removal of features to fix the glitches, unbalanced new champions - the game is very addictive, fun and great. 10/10"
8859,It's fun. Play with friends so you can share the salt.
8860,yes
8861,"Played on PS4 since beta, recently came to PC cos deluxe was on sale. Great game if you didn't start it on a SONY platform. Matchmaking still takes an ungodly amount of time, the devs pretty much stopped caring about ranked and even your placement matches will be 10 minute queues. Bugs from beta still exist and CC only gets worse.
All that being said, the cards system incorporated with the TF2 style gameplay is very very good, to the point I have played this game for 5 years despite all of the atrocities that have happened with. CC is an issue, yes, but it gives an actual skill gap to the game that didn't really exist early on in the games' life as a lot of the pros and normal players were literally in the same bracket(yes I know pro play was a joke in terms of eSports overall,) but now you can actually have a learning curve to put yourself above others. Old characters for the most part still are good even 5 years after, and new characters are usually really strong when added but the game eventually balances around that. Yes, there are specific outlying champs that simply outclass everyone else in their archetype, but for who people actually want to play and do play anyway, the game IS fairly balanced. Bugs do completely fuck this up sometimes, but the game has had massive dips and climbs of players and different teams have worked on the game itself making a lot of the fixes take an incredible amount of time as the game was built on shit code that the current team has somehow made work. I definitely recommend buying the deluxe edition on a sale as it is at least worth that entirely over F2P as you will enjoy it more with the vast and expanding roster. I could recommend the Deluxe at the full price tag as well, but I personally already bought the game twice so I wasn't going to pay full again as SONY refuses to let account merging be a thing on their draconian shithole of a platform. TL;DR: Worth $30USD, if you like it, worth $60. Game has some bugs and can be sweaty but is definitely the most fun non-competitive FPS."
8862,big boobies and bootys
8863,shit game
8864,Not bad I'd say.
8865,this is great
8866,"Good game, I like it very much, especially with friends the best.
Lots of champions, skills, skins.

Although the game is free, but not yet,
Because you should sacrifice a lot of money if we really love it,
Because the crystals are very little and is very expensive,
Deluxe DLC If you are not purchased,
You have to play a lot of hours to unlock more champions,
The prices of the crates are high, so there are few skin funds.

We usually only we play unranked matches,
Ranked matches If I'm not good, it's better to miss,
Especially if you have a very high ping.

The game is good, sometimes there are bugs, but it is very costly to open chests.
Unfortunately, there are items that can not be obtained, for example, moves, dances or emotions.
Unfortunately in the beta version I did not have the opportunity to play because then Paladins was an unknown game for me, allegedly many players liked the beta version, I do not know ...

If I wouldn't be friends with whom I could play with,
Then I would rate the game negative."
8867,"Just like life, it hits differnet"
8868,"good
"
8869,"you never quit paladins, you just take a prolonged break. Buggy and unbalanced game; it's a dumpster fire but a very fun one."
8870,"When you have 2 sides picking rounded teams this game is amazing. But that is a rare rare thing. Game chat is filled with trolls that never get banned, today alone I've been told to ""go die"",""get cancer"" as well as being called disabled and those aren't even the greatest hits. The queue times are awfully long for ranked games and people frequently AFK games or throw games to be spiteful. It is the same characters trolling again and again who get reported in game, who you see the very next day. The studio is far more concerned with churning out new payable content than policing their own dying game from the trolls that are killing it.

If you have 4 friends to play with, you'll be fine and love it. If not, good luck."
8871,qwesdfgh good
8872,Grover's My Favorite
8873,Super fun game with great skins and graphics. The characters are even in skill (In my opinion) and has a good rankings system. 10/10!

8889,"This is hands down my favorite hero shooter. I love both Overwatch and Paladins, but conceptually, Paladins has more to offer to challenge me (i.e. talents, items, loadouts, etc.). People love to compare them, but Overwatch just feels like the same thing over and over again, whereas Paladins allows each game to change dynamically.

Healers being able to defend themselves is a huge plus. The inactive healing mechanic is pretty cool...makes for some sweaty games. I love that they add new champions frequently enough so that I don't get bored.

The only feedback I have is to get better graphics, and the beef up the competitive scene. They'll need to throw money at this game to make it more successful. I'd hate for it to die when it is truly is the best of the hero shooters right now despite its lack of popularity."
8890,shit game. wasted 1.5k hours of my life
8891,"It's generally fun, free and tasking especially when playing good players"
8892,why is there a charector that can do more damage than cassie and shoot faster then her and why is there a fox lady who deploys a fox with more that 2k hp and act as a shield that can attack?
8893,its a rip off of over watch but its a good game

8931,"Before I played Paladins i had a big penis, two girlfriends and a lot of will to live. None of these things have changed, so I have no idea if this game is good."
8932,"latest champion is a black man frontline that is op asf 

meanwhile white man frontline like torvald is weak asf

i will not support this blatant racism towards white men"
8933,cool game
8934,Not sure how i feel about it yet need another couple hours to decide
8935,"The game itself is easier to learn and casual with short match times. You can play from a huge roster and choose your own playstyle. The best part is that it can play even at your low spec pc.
If they say that this is an Overwatch rip-off, well, it has more and varied characters than that and is F2P. Worth a shot."
8936,haha androxus go pewpew
8937,good game but is good i like de but this but game but

8945,absolutely fantastic!
8946,"this game is pretty good ,but the balancing sucks horse 4.5 kg cock"
8947,This game is so bad that i get anxiety when i open it. One time i got so depressed that i nearly tripped over a banana and killed myself. I literally wouldn't recommend this game to any one with below 30 IQ.
8948,nice game
8949,i only play viktor ;)
8950,Better than Omegalulverwatch
8951,"game good :)
"
8952,Cool game. I wish i had friends to play with me:)
8953,"Pretty shoddy, a little pay to win but grinding is always an option, the learning curve might as well be a red carpet leading to professionalism, mechanics get boring at times, some characters need rebalancing and more.
The issues dont outway the posotives, this game is pretty good otherwise, 7/10"
8954,worth playing if you dont want to buy overwatch
8955,azaan
8956,Best played with Friends
8957,Good Fucking Game
8958,Great game!
8959,game is fire
8960,"This game saved my life.

I am 42.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

9010,Nice game to play when you want to chill and stay alone.
9011,yes
9012,"Ah sh!t, here we go again... 
Another Hi-Rez failure. 

Played this game a bit in the beta and on the release before it got on Steam. It was good and fun back then and it looked promising...
But Hi-Rez didnt know what to do with the game at all. Over the time i played, they did insane amount of changes. Basically every week i felt like i was playing almost a new game. In beta i had no problem with that it was understandable, but it kept happening even when they released the game. 
Since they had no clue what to do with Paladins, they started to treat the game same way like they do with Smite. Lets just add as many new characters, skins etc as fast as possible and hope that people will forget about everything wrong with the game. But thats not how it works. 
Game is a big unbalanced mess. There is just so much wrong with it, but they dont care and its not gonna get any better... 
Paladins just share the same fate like Smite does. Sad because game had potentional

Avoid Hi-Rez at all cost. Its just not worth to play their games"

9020,Best game I've ever played
9021,"This game had lots of potentials. It'd be an entertaining game to play if the devs did things right. But unfortunately, they can't even fix the bugs I faced even in beta days back in 2016, and also after the Rise of Furia update, every skin or in-game content are just disappointing."
9022,"The game's got more new heroes and updates than Overwatch now and it's not even funny. 

Give it a shot, it's actually pretty fun.

It wanted to be Overwatch but it followed in its footsteps a little too much."

9054,"Paladins never cease to bring players with consistent updates and new champions. They tend to make brand new characters overpowered though. But it is for the sake of maintaining a healthy playerbase or increase it. 
As of right now, Paladins has 52 champions.
It is overwhelming at first, but as time goes on, you will fully understand how the game works.
Paladins is a great FPS game that gives you the opportunity to fully customize your favorite champions. From their looks to their gameplays. And that is extremely enjoyable!
You will find your perfect fit either way.
Cheers!"

9096,devs apparently cant test their game before adding champions so you cant play until they decide to change something
9097,They took everything from me.
9098,"It's a pretty fun game but it's main value comes from playing it with friends along with the hero pass which gives you accsess to every character in the game and every one that they'll add in the future. If you're willing to get into it with a couple of friends it's actually a super fun exprience and the constant adding of characters makes sure that it stays fresh,"
9099,ame the best
9100,d
9101,"The game is fun, albeit a little buggy and a little laggy sometimes but honestly alot of fun though I may be biased because it's my first hero shooter. I mostly play bot or casual and that's all I can recommend. I tried ranked once and the experience was so bad I have vowed to never touch it again and according to my friends (who were playing with me) that is not the worst they have experienced. Let's just say, reporting someone for being new is not a good way to help a game with an apparently dying userbase."

9113,"Every sweaty fucker plays Tyra, Viktor, Octavia and so on. Azaan is fucking busted. Yagorath's ult targeter is dogshit, commonly when I see the targeter on the enemy, I press E and it insta goes on cooldown, charge up takes a long fucking time even with morale boost. No one click to block players, can't see a block list as far as I can tell. Vora 66% execute ult? Are you fucking kidding me?
Playing as Yag, I would still have 2000hp left. As it feels, my winrate has to be 20%, which means balancing is horrible. Constantly matchmade against premades or players of higher level.

Drip fed crystals and constantly bombarded with buying microtransactions, have a million in gold, nothing to do with but stare at them and hope the devs acutally makes them fucking useful someday."
9114,Tons of fun despite a few bugs and imbalances

9136,"This game was super refreshing after playing a lot of OW several years ago. Nowadays I seldom play either, but find this game vastly less infuriating.

There's a ton of heroes, all unique and powerful in the right hands, and plenty of customization (something OW always lacked). It's a shame it doesn't get more recognition, but there is still a super active player base, it's free, and it scratches the team shooter itch as good as any game out there.

Overall, if you're remotely curious about this game, play it. I don't recall it being that pricey to unlock all the heroes (you can grind for them as well), but with dozens of unique heroes and satisfying abilities/gameplay, it's a no-brainer if you like these types of games."

9146,tf2 is better
9147,.
9148,"The game runs nice and all, although the budget is limited, there are some nuggets that shine through and through. 

However, it doesn't really matter because the player base is as dumb as a rock. I've been trying to play this game 3 or 4 times and every single time I came to the same conclusion: ""It is not fun to play this game not because of the mechanics or balance, not because I don't like the visuals or audio, but because I can't stand playing with morons"".

Most of the time people don't know what to do in this game and by that I don't mean using the best deck for the character or whatever. Just in general, they run around, do stupid things and if you are trying to play the game at that moment the way it was intended to be played, well, tough luck.

It's like trying to play football when your team is out there just ""having fun kicking the ball"" while the enemy team is genuinely playing.

Playing this game makes me sick."
9149,v cool
9150,Perfect game
9151,yes
9152,paladins is cool
9153,why all the big character got tiny weapons
9154,DELETE MAEVE AND SKYE!!!!
9155,"Don't bother if you are trying to keep your progress from else where.  I tried to migrate as I stopped playing console and have a PC and come to find out Hi-Rez will let you link your PSN and Steam account to your Hi-Rez account but you will LOOSE EVERYTHING, all champions you already bought, all levels you had, all extras you had.  I'm done, if you won't let me move over all that effort then you stop getting my money and support.  It's been fun Paladins.

FYI   I had hundreds of hours on PS4, if you tell me to start over I will, just not with you Hi-Rez"
9156,"A good game, with a lot a diffrent characters, maps and bulids to choose from.
Can be unbalanced at times, and ranked matchmaking will not guarantee players with the same level of skills as you.

overall 8/10"
9157,Its fun.
9158,free

9161,"The game is wonderful! I've been playing it since 2018, it's a kind of parody of overwatch, but it's free) There is a good community and generous developers! The most important thing is that the person who invests real money in the game does not dominate, but only acquires some kind of appearance for the hero!"

9167,"Overwatch, but more elegant, and more consistently paced. Increeeeedibly grindy if you're committed to F2P. Champions cost 30K or 60K, while you earn 100-200 per match. No single best build, because everything can be VERY effectively countered. Can be a bit of a challenge to pick up, because the gap between bots and human opponents is frankly terrifying."

9187,"Great Game, Good concepts and mechanics however poor excecution of new champions (characters) and balancing of them. Also has many bugs. The game would be much better if EvilMojo decided to care about the game a little bit more instead of just trying to yeet out new champions after new champions which end up being broken and over powered most of the time"
9188,There's no need to have Overwatch to know this game sucks compared to it
9189,Yes good game better than every game I've pooped with

9191,I enjoy the characters and the gameplay much more than overwatch
9192,"Good game to at least play 6 rounds of, 5 to unlock Ame and one to listen to Amelia's legendary amazing announcer voice."
9193,gud game
9194,best game
9195,"While I do recommend this it depends on a few conditions.

I have played on and off since the games early days.  I won't go into past problems.  The game is in one of the best states it has ever been in right now.  It's a great alternative to Overwatch and TF2.

My issues with the game is wait times.  For a ranked game you can be waiting for a long time even during peak hours.  I'm not a high rank, I am where I imagine most common players are.  Peak hours of 7-10pm est.  And wait times vary from 10-20 minutes to get into a game.  However, casual modes seem to only take 2-3 minutes tops to find a game.  The ranked/competitive scene seems exceptionally dead as of writing this.
It's a shame because, as I mentioned earlier, the game is in one of it's best states I have ever seen."

9197,"Like, its okay, its not even that good. what do you mean I have 180 hours when I did this review? Bro, like, I dont know what your talking about. I swear I dont even like this game that much. What do you mean I'm in denial? Stop, dude. I dont know what your talking about. Its alright"

9275,"oki
"
9276,"It's a fun game, despite being unbalanced or having a lot of bugs. but ame voice pack >;)"
9277,"My friend recommended this to me. Said ""it looks like bootleg Overwatch but it's actually pretty cool"". After giving it a try for a few hours I have to say: It looks like bootleg Overwatch and it plays like bootleg Overwatch. The game's community has less communication than other MOBAs, the different abilities make no sense to me, sometimes I can't even tell what they do, the levels all feel pretty dark, I found the interface clunky and confusing at times, and you can't even play as any character. You have to grind several hours as the free options, none of which I found satisfying, to even get the one you want. Or you could pay for it but like... I dunno. I feel like a lot of this was poor expectations set up by my friend but I also just am not having any fun playing it. To be fair I didn't pay for Overwatch either, it was gifted to me, but I'd still rather pay for a complete game than a free confusing one. Heck, League of Legends plays better and is less confusing. Maybe I'll come back to it eventually, give it another shot, but right now I'm unimpressed. As I feel right now, I can't recommend it. Could totally be missing something or not getting something but I feel pretty solid about my opinion."
9278,Game isnt worth it just a massive ass grind for characters community is insanely toxic to the point i dont want to play straight up cant play casual games without someone leaving in discord just done with this game. Save yourself some time and look for another game with a less toxic community
9279,"good game
"
9280,"Very nice game I highly recommend it, too bad for the community that does not support the game and cannot make interesting crossovers, but the game itself takes you a lot at first because it has unique features in the game such as the deck system and cards. After when you have a good knowledge of the game to continue to keep alive that initial emotion just play the ranked. The community penalizes some aspects but the game itself deserves a lot. So what do you have to lose? It's free.

9281,a good fps game. fun to play but the lack of communications and new content makes it boring fast.
9282,ok
9283,Ye
9284,nice
9285,"very good game , really enjoy it"
9286,"Reviewing cause Ame. Game seems fun, I want to like it and have came back 3 days but the matchmaking seriously holds the game back from being enjoyable. Each game is just a roflstomp by 1-2 players absolutely destroying the enemy team - not fun for either side (Except those 2 guys lol)."
9287,"Wait for a match after 4 minutes or so only to have about 2 afk teammates with pubstomping enemies as you reconnect back into the game 4 times in a row not even earning any credits.
Oh, and the new character is unkillable, so having him on the enemy side aint fun to fight against.

Long queue times combined with disconnecting servers and imbalanced matchmaking. Its just exhausting despite being a casual game."
9288,Great game but it was way better a couple of years ago
9289,"Surprisingly, got called less slurs here than in Overwatch."
9290,Downloading it again for Amelia Watson.
9291,"fun, just like OW some characters are op. but overall pretty fun. might buy full game."
9292,"good, free overwatch"
9293,It has Amelia Watson 10/10.

9295,Is fun. Do it.
9296,Overwatch but none of the characters are broken

9303,"Do you want a good substitute for Overwatch? Do you not like spending another dime for an online multiplayer game upfront? Do you like fantasy hero shooters? If you said yes to all those questions, then this game is for you!!!"
9304,"I really love this game, like a lot. However, I have a problem with the Bounty Coins. I've done so many things to earn them, but it tells me that I have 0 of them. I'm not sure if this is a glitch or something that a lot of people had been experiencing... If this had a rating system, I'd give it 4.9/5 stars. I only docked it because of the Bounty Coins issue I'm having."
9305,"its a 5 vs. 5 arena shooter, characters feel unique and has solid feel and response.  free to play, only downside is how slow you earn currency
"
9306,"I've been playing this game since ""kind of"" the beginning.. I absolutely love this game ( not the community though ) but after all these years this game still crashes randomly. and now after I upgraded to win11 it crashes on menu after 10 seconds now. It's unplayable. I can't count how many times I got banned for the game crashing by itself in the middle of character selection but that was fine... now this new thing... made it unplayable."
9307,ame :thumbsup:
9308,better than overwatch.

9323,"I've been playing this game on and off since it came out. I really wish Steam had a ""meh"" score because I don't feel like this game deserves a negative review, but I don't think it deserves a positive review either. 

I suppose I may as well compare this to Overwatch, since that's always the first thing people bring up. Saying this game is a ""knockoff"" of Overwatch is inaccurate, since they were both in development at around the same time. Do some of the characters in here feel like OW clones? Yeah definitely, and some of the later additions may very well be, but let's be honest here. Overwatch knocked off TF2 with a lot of its characters, but at least Paladins has the decency to admit it's being derivative (like having an Engie skin and voice for Barik). 

As far as the gameplay itself goes, it feels a little clunkier than Overwatch because of the typical Hi-Rez jank, but it's fine for the most part. The characters are where it really shines though. There's more variety than Overwatch and characters have more defined roles (there's an actual flanking category). The moba-like card and talent system is also a great feature, since it gives you multiple ways to play the same character. You could have a pure healer Grover, or if you're a secondary healer you can focus on CC and DPS. It's incredibly flexible. 

Sadly, there are two areas where I feel like the game falls short. For one, matches are only 5v5 as opposed to Overwatch's 6v6. There are people who say 5v5 is fine and that's how it should be, but unless your team is REALLY coordinated, you're going to need two healers, i.e. you're going to have to sacrifice a DPS. Ordinarily this would be fine, since most healers in this game can actually put out decent damage, but the problem is the playerbase. I don't play ranked so I can't comment on that, but in casual it's extremely rare to ever get in a match where another person wants to be healer. You can see them hovering over a healer, and the second you lock in your healer, they immediately swap to DPS. And then they proceed to try to Rambo everything thinking you'll drop everything to heal them from across the map. And that's the other problem. The community is uh...not great. Again, I can't speak for ranked, but in casual there is zero communication. In Overwatch and even TF2 (at least on community servers) there's at least some communication. People on here will also get REALLY mad if you lock in a character they wanted to play as, even when they said nothing before the match started. And once a character is locked in you can't switch, so now you have to deal with a teammate who hates you.  

The one other complaint I have is that there just aren't enough maps. They consistently add new characters and skins (way more than what Overwatch ever did) and while I do appreciate it, I really wish they'd design more maps. Recently they reskinned a map, and it looks WAY nicer than what it did before...but I'd still like more. Or at the very least, a custom mode. But given how janky Hi-Rez games can be, it would probably result in a lot of bugs. It's just...they have battle passes and expensive skins requiring a lot of paid in-game currency. Surely they can do more with their budget? Then again, given all the stuff they've put in SMITE lately (Ninja Turtles, The Last Airbender, Transformers) I'd bet Hi-Rez spends most of their budget on licensing deals and leaves their devs out to dry.

JULY '22 UPDATE: well now the game is just plain awful. I install, log into the game and the first thing I see is a full screen notification for their RWBY crossover. Click out and then I see ANOTHER full screen notification telling me about the battle pass. Click out and then I see a thing where I can get free gems or whatever if I watch a 30 second ad. Paladins is now acting like a trashy mobile game and it feels like one too. 

The game is somehow even buggier now. On the character select screen, the background textures constantly flicker. Half the time the textures on my own character don't load. Decided to try out the new character Lillith, locked her in, and decided to buy the green variant of her skin since I had a ton of gold coins just sitting around. It popped up the notification for the new skin, and it would NOT go away. Kept clicking next, kept clicking dismiss all, the notification wouldn't go away until the match loaded. Character animations don't work sometimes. Sound effects don't play half the time, so I can't tell if my attacks connected unless I'm staring directly at the enemy I targeted. Game is also plagued by cheaters, so the only time you might have fun is when you're playing training matches against the AI. 

What an absolute waste. Everyone at Hi-Rez and Evil Mojo should be ashamed of themselves. Go play Valorant. Go play CoD Warzone. Go play Halo Infinite. Wait for Overwatch 2. Anything would be a better use of your time than this garbage."
9324,I like this game a lot and it's FREE.
9325,Good game. Toxic player base (but what game doesnt have one of those). The updates are always nice. Hikey criminal that its free..
9326,stupid game
9327,"Its fun, but i was hoping that it could be more custom like tf2 community servers"
9328,*Hic*
9329,"It's ok, probably not on par with TF2 or OVERWATCH but still pretty good.
A more unique champion shooter since each champion is highly customizeable and you wont see that in other games within the same category."

9331,"Downloaded it again to get the Ame voice pack, got taken to a 'Make a new Account name' screen and found out my 5 year old account which had almost everything unlocked back then including the founders pack is f*cking gone. 

Submitted a support ticket but no idea if they can help.

9343,yes
9344,"Great game honestly wished more people played it so more effort could be put in the game,it actually has potential."
9345,Used to like this game when it was first released in 2016. More champions added and less fixes led to more bugs and pay to win situations. Some compare it to overwatch but it's like an in between Moba and FPS. Currently 6/10 for me

9350,"Any MOBA, especially with more than 3 players in a team, especially in the ranked mode, should have roles selection before match-making (which affecting it). Without this there are a lot of match breakers: players, who don't want to play for some roles and ruine matches."
9351,"Matchmaking is so bad, you're either against complete newbies and dominate the match easily which is unfun or you get the no-lifer tryhard discord call team that obliterates you for having played 1000 times more than you. I only have a dozen hours in this game so far, and every single game has been dominate everyone or be dominated by everyone."
9352,yes

9357,Good game to play with friends
9358,"I started playing Paladins back in 2017, during the open beta. I've been hesitant to give this game a review for years, even though I have over 1,000 hours in it. Paladins is a hard game to review. 

Paladins is fun, but only when you're in a party with your friends. Going into casual, or ranked, by yourself is no where near as fun as playing with your friends. I wouldn't recommend playing by yourself at all. With the current update cycle, there's a new champion every two months, which changes the meta, especially in ranked. Getting new skins every two months is also nice, even if some of the champions haven't had a new one in years. 

Even so, there are numerous bugs preventing me from fully recommending the game. In-game hitboxes are infuriating, and the invisible walls make the few flying champions feel bad to play. As much as I love getting new content every two months, I feel I would much prefer it if Evil Mojo took the time to patch these bugs out. The fact that Vora's prematch cosmetic splash art is misaligned, leaving a jarring black rectangle, doesn't affect gameplay at all -- its just gives the game an unrefined look. 

All in all, Paladins is a good game, great, even. Evil Mojo does take community feedback to heart, and does care about this game and community. And, simply put, Evil Mojo is a much better company than Blizzard ever was or could hope to achieve. If you can look past the bugs, Paladins is the best of its genre."

9366,"Cock and ball torture From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia at en.wikipedia.org
Cock and ball torture (CBT) is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation or even kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant.
Image: Electrostimulation applied on a penis
Contents: Section 1: In Pornography Section 2: Ball stretcher Section 3: Parachute Section 4: Humbler Section 5: Testicle cuff
Section 1: In pornography
In addition to it’s occasional role in BDSM pornography, Tamakeri (literally Ball kicking) is a separate genre in Japan. One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles.
Section 2: Ball stretcher A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body. While leather stretchers are most common, other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer. The length of the stretcher may vary from 1-4 inches, and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds.
Section 3: Parachute
A Parachute is a small collar, usually made from leather, which fastens around the scrotum, and from which weights can be hung. Conical in shape, three or four short chains hanging beneath, to which weights can be attached. Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship, the parachute provides a constant drag, and squeezing effects on the man’s testicles. Moderate weights of 3-5 kg can be suspended, especially during bondage. Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move, when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.
Section 4: Humbler
A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene. The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum, mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks. This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward, as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum, causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain.
Section 5: Testicle cuff
A testicle cuff is a ring-shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it. A common type has two connected cuffs, one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis. They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia. A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum; without the key it cannot be removed.
Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being ""owned"", while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of ""owning"" their partners. Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner, who may be either male or female. There is a level of humiliation involved, by which they find sexual arousal. The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner.
However, these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs. More conventionally, the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation, which has a number of benefits:
Making the penis appear longer. Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone, exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view. Improving sexual arousal. While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being ""owned"", the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one's legs and pointing the toes. Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis, a condition which can be very uncomfortable, especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse. Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the ""point of no return"". It is much harder to reach an orgasm."

I would have to say it's better than Overwatch on many levels in my honest opinion. Nice visuals and good balancing of champions to make game play exciting with not one champion doing everything while everyone else is afk. If you're into shooters with abilities then you most likely enjoy this game as well."

9401,"tldr - amazing, play it


longer version--

I've got over 2k hours on this game.  I play it a lot and over the years always come back to it because at it's core it is an amazing game.  I'll list pros and cons and because the cons are extensive i'll counter them all and explain why i still play this beast despite them.

Pros:
-FTP, absolutely no need to spend in this game
-interesting characters that combo together.  Every game is different and that's amazing.  Except at high rank i'll cover that. 
 in cons.  The game is amazing because you will have to kind of learn the game anew each match with the composition you have and be flexible enough to figure out the playstyle that will make it work.  For instance it might fail until you figure out to group up well, or until you figure out to focus a specific weakness of the other team of of the map.  This means tactical thinking is rewarded on top of skill.  Knowledge of maps and characters and sound are cumulative and the net effect is a very enjoyable competitive match.
-looks great even on a toaster
-skill pays off 
-Ranked games come in less than 2 minutes at all hours
-character voice commands, not a lot of games have this but in this game they are fun and highly useful.  Some of the skins come with special voice packs which is really a nice touch and fun.
-skins actually enjoyableif you spend a lot of time in the game and honestly they really did well with their business model.
-champ abilities combo together powerfully and interestingly in groups.  2+2=5


cons:
-highly toxic player base that increases in toxicity the higher you rank with plat + being unbearable.  Thankfully you can mute them in games which i do almost every game from the first sign of one guy being a little B.  I realized early on there's no point communicating with people in this game anyways, skill should take over intuitively and the character voice commands can handle the rest.  

-The ranking system is pointless due to the fact that the player base suffer from copycat syndrome and refuse to play any characters except those sanctions by streamers and so on.  Each season the streamers rank the characters and the unoriginal masses just copy that and throw fits if you don't pick a character named by their favorite e-legend or whatever.  They also bandwagon together to try to sound better than they are.  This leads ranked play at higher lvls to be really boring and each match a repeat of the last, and a higher concentration of babies playing.  The skill levels at higher brackets actually decreases as people become inflexible and double toxics.  Like they have nothing in their life except the rank # to be proud of.  Extremely SAD.  

That being said you can downrank easily and play in the sweet spot which is mid gold to mid plat.  You'll see what i mean, pretty fast.  Unless you're a squealing man child who needs the game to say master next to your name so you can finally find the validation your parents and peers never gave you...  But even then this game has a place for you and a peer group you'll understand LOL

9402,kys u fucking rtetarded game
9403,"Here's my personal experience with ""Hi-Rez Studios"" and ""Easy Anti-Cheat"" and ""Paladins"" as a whole. I first joined the game a few days ago after getting a little bored of Overwatch and as I progressively played and unlocked some content with my decent aim from all my experience in games like this one... I proceeded to buy around $82.00 worth of extra content however from this moment on was down hill. After spending a lot of hard earned money on this game I wanted to show off my new content in training mode with fellow players in which we all face AI bots. I had a really good round I was having a blast but my Bluetooth Xbox One remote (The one I use for most the games I play on PC) started to die and usually when that happens while playing any game on my system it causes a memory leak or some kind of heavy glitch that takes down my FPS and crashes the game till my batteries are replaced. Long story short the game crashed after my controller died well I thought no biggie I'll just re-log like I do every time my controller crashes a game... well I re-log and come back to a big fat banned screen their anti-cheat had detected the glitch as a cheat and banned me right as it happened! I was not upset right off the bat however I was instantly concerned about my account and sent in a support ticket explaining what happened, after a few days they hit me back with some generic message almost auto like response explaining how I cheated and I was banned for breaking the rules. I was very frustrated at this point because they not only sent me a generic response but they also flat out ignored my concerns with what was going on. I thought okay I will try to find another way to contact them so I headed to the Paladins Reddit Discord server and contacted a few employees only to be told to send in another support ticket... I went ahead and filed another support ticket with Hi-Rez and got the same automated message saying I was banned for cheating. I continued to search for one last bit of hope so I had a private discussion with a Hi-Rez Steam Discussions admin, who had validated mine and others concerns with this games anti-cheat and told me to send in a support ticket. I sent in this final ticket explaining yet again what happened and got the same exact generic automated response. I never cheated. This is a honest review of my experience with Paladins and this company, This is also not a public ban appeal discussion I'm not trying to get un-banned anymore however I would suggest you switch to Steams anti-cheat system because others all over the web are expressing the same issues with ""Easy Anti-Cheat""."

Theres balance issues with certain characters feeling much stronger than others but everything feels very polished and fun. Theres ways to get battle passes and skins for free as a F2P player (which will require you to play quite a bit. But the point is its possible). Overal its a great replacement for other Moba shooters if youre not feeling like supporting Blizzard anymore like me and want to switch from OW."

9446,"Do I recommend this game? Of course not!

They literally just release a champion that is almost unkillable, deals some good damage and can heal!
Davs, if you are going down this route, then you are going without me!

The only good addition in the latest update is the Ame announcer voice pack.

This game uses client side kernel ring 0 anti cheat. This means the anti cheat is running in the core of the OS and it's always on. Why is this bad? Because it's a high security risk and it can control and block every single driver on your pc. Does this sound bad to you? I hope so. Because it is. Also, don't forget that Epic - the owner of Easy Anti-Cheat - belongs to 48.4% to Tencent the biggest chinese corporation. I probably don't need to tell you how Tencent got so big."

There are several modes on the game which features the control of a certain point in order to gain points and destroy the enemies as well a team deathmatch such as the one you see on all of duty so if u are a cod fun u will have some fun playing this game. One major advantage of this game is that it is free to play and there are no types of p2w items or abilities that allow the spender to have more % of win than the f2p player. The graphics are decent, and the different heroes are incredible both on visual and unique skills. Definately suggested"

9493,"OMG, 4500 hours now. What can I say, this game is a game you love to hate. Its the epitome of rage quit. I've played this for a long long time over so many updates and developer changes. With the state the game is in currently It's essentially a bug city. audio glitches, rubber banding, mount glitches, etc. Not to mention every time they release a new game mode or champion they ""Hotfix"" old bugs, creating new ones. Its like a money pit investment property that you were given for free but every time you fix an issue another one appears. As much as I love this game and how addicting it is, I can't recommend it. It will steal your soul, deprive you of sanity, and make you come back begging for more torture. They should really rename this game to Stockholm Syndrome."

But lately i'm not having fun, i'm raging so much against this game and i'm not supposed to because it's a free game.
Well I will start with the matchmaking... Its horse crap. Im lvl 90 and i play against starters that dont know how to play the game and dont make an effort to play it.
In every game that i entered maybe 2/3 of the games 1 player is afk or he quit the game or he is replaced with a bot and in many of the cases is a noob and doesnt listen to what the others say.
This literally kills my experience in the game.*

9541,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you, Amelia Watson. You've genuinely saved my life with this voice pack."

9548,I came for Ame.
9549,paladins is a love hate relationship that you cant help but never let go once you are too far into it and will surface your inner tryhard to optimise every single thing in the game till the point of no return and once you have optimised a character fully to be the best possible allowing you to demolish noobs and veterans the character gets a completely random change that you might of not been wary about breaking your entire build one day causing you to maybe try again oh right some characters get completely forgotten about broken permanently and some characters just can do the job of the other character but are way better in very aspect and when new characters come out your build for a certain character fails because that character counters you completely causing the whole cycle to repeat itself again 10/10 not enough new character tryhards
9550,Only re-downloading for THE Amelia Watson announcer pack.
9551,"gaming, to be honest this game is a masterpiece, people call it a bootleg of overwatch, but to be honest, idc  if it is, its free, and has way more features and a less toxic community, 11/10, would unlock barik tf2 skin again"

9564,"Good game but a lot of bug.

9565,"I may not have many hours displayed here but I actually played this game a lot before getting it on Steam, using the Hi-Rez launcher, even spending some money to support the devs. At that time, during 2017-2018 I had a lot of fun and played with a friend quite often, but as other games started releasing and we had other things to do, so we just moved on. 

Game is okay, basically described as a ""free Overwatch"", but with much more consistent updates, new champions and balance. The skins are usually very good and some characters are interesting to play, but if you start loging in less and less, coming back like I did will be tough.

I don't really care much about the game now but I'm sure that if you don't mind investing some time you'll have a nice and competitive experience for (at least) months! If you don't like it it's fine

EDIT: before you could buy 1 pack to unlock every champion and instantly get new ones when they released. Now you have 3 different kinds of ""packs"" that unlock a different amount of characters and the most expensive one will give you access to the newer champions. That's quite bad if you ask me, but at least you can still unlock them with the in-game currencies (afaik), don't know how much grind you'd need tho..."

9648,"I played the game since it's first released, now i'm back because of the update. Here are some of my thoughts about the game:
⚬ Graphic: The game has a "" cartoony "" graphic, it looks like it's made in 2012 not 2018. However because its graphic, the game is playable even if you have a bad computer ( mine included ).
⚬ Gameplay: It's easy to play but hard to master, every characters ( I think ) have simple kits, not complicated. However, the game is kinda "" unbalance "", some characters are RIDICULOUSLY overpowered, and if you don't ban one of them in ranked, you just gonna have a bad time playing against them.
⚬ Other thoughts:
- You don't need to spend your money to get crystals, you can grind to get it and it's pretty easy to get. ( I've 600 crystals currently more than enough to buy the new event pass without spending a single dime )
- If you are a competitive players, you must have patience because the queue time in ranked is at least 5~ mins and the matchmaking is BAD. For example, if you're new to rank, you will queue with/ aganist 1 - 2 grandmaster, the others could be gold or above.
⚬ Overall, the game is still fun to play in normal but in ranked, it's not. If you're a competitive players and you want to grind your rank, I wouldn't recommend you play the game.

9655,Pretty good
9656,"This games balance is all over the place but at the same time the cards, talents and items makes for some fun oppertunities to be creative! Community is much like that of overwatch and other class shooters so it is best to just mute people as soon as they have a gamer moment. Now this game is a ton of fun with friends as you can make alot of cool tactics together and have fun seeing them work or not :D

The only downside of this game in right now is that if you are just getting into it they removed the option to ""Buy"" the full game. Basically you could for 25 eur buy a champion pass that would give you all current and future champions forever. This package is unfortunatly gone and replaced by season passes so you can only really pay for the game 1 year at a time. I don't like this but i was lucky enough to get the old package back when it was a thing. I think this game is worth checking out and for me so far it has been alot of hours of fun to play by myself or with groups of friends. 

The best thing is that it is free, so give it a try and if it is boring you can always uninstall it and not play it again :)"

Play it if you dont plan on going into ranked, otherwise you will have a bad time if you are not already a damn good player"
9678,"Used to be cool, now neglected by the devs for any meaningful change. They had their chance to fix it many times. The game was going uphill but bad update after bad update just shit on the game's enjoyment for not just myself but many many players who left from the OB64 update alone. Plus they removed payload which was literally the best gamemode for whatever reason. They put a bandaid on an open wound by every character release, and just blatantly ignore their playerbase. Not only that but Drogoz doesnt 1 tap direct hits anymore; balancing has been awful for the games whole lifecycle.

UI has been marginally improved which is a plus over 3 years right?

Play it if youre bored but get ready for bugs upon bugs and mediocre game play. Would still recommend paladins over OW and Hi-Rez over Blizzard as we all know what blizzard is doing :( 

If Paladins has a knockoff version, it would probably function better than Paladins."
9679,This is the type of game that expedites the accumulation of e-waste. Play if you hate yourself.

9689,good game on god
9690,GG pog champ
9691,game is meh but not good has overwatch but it needs to FIX SBMM and the ranking times...i play both on PC and Xbox but the Xbox severs are even worst with the ranking times... u need a 5 man to make pass 5 to 10 minutes of grinding but it should never be that long has a video game player since the 90's I rather play CoD than this even BOII and there ranking time is like 3 to 6 minutes.
9692,"Braindead playerbase, broken heroes, overly simple maps. This is the free alternative for shooter rejects and degens who can't figure out team play or understand comps. Ultimately though it's my fault for thinking f2p people want to play objective."
9693,"If you want all the toxic nonsense of a TF2 knockoff WITH all the horrible game gimmicks of a MOBA, just .... just think about your life choices and dont play games anymore ok? ur life is worth living. Get outa ur house, go meet a girl, and touch some grass."

"
9710,some of the characters have fat tits
9711,this game is so worth it!!
9712,"There is not really a champion meta (like Overwatch metas that are very painful to deal with), so you can play any champion and still carry a game.  There are only 3 game modes tho :( I wanna be able to play a bigger variety of game modes and I feel like that would help bring more players.  Also, let us play Onslaught in comp plzzzz"
9713,"The game is pretty dead, but its fun in doses.  There just aren't enough game modes in my opinion."

9729,only ever played dis because i didnt have overwatch on pc
9730,Its like overwatch but has differences but I overall love this game

9736,"veri gud game, i rekomend!"
9737,"I love this game!
Its alot of fun, and its like fortnite with magic. But not fortnite x)
I have played this game quite a few hours and i had fun the whole time!
I played this with friends, and on stream with viewers and it was a blast!
I like that there are so many characters to choose from, and that there are battle passes so that you get more stuff if you want it.
I love this game, and have had a lot of fun with it^^"

"
9739,"FUN

9740,yep

9743,"Pros: The game is fun. The characters are cool and there is a huge variety. 

Cons: Match making doesn't work well. Super toxic community.

Overwatch with worse humans. I would recommend the game for the game play and cool characters, but the community tries hard to ruin the fun."
9744,TORVALDDDD
9745,Casual alternative to Overwatch (but it's actually fun and gets updates) 4/7 would play again

9748,good
9749,sure
9750,High skill gap.

9752,HI
9753,"Before I played Paladins i was a toxic american kid, my gf left me fro my best friend, i got depression, alcoholism and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
9754,"i love playing with people they are fun they are really good to practice with so a dded them i will be sad? please  add the therm sorry them but add them please
"
9755,"the gameplay is okay, so many bugs that go unfixed and they still add new content without even bothering."
9756,"Gamers game, csf"
9757,its fun
9758,010011101101
9759,"It's okay, i guess.

I did enjoy the old battle pass system a lot more, but thats probably more of a personal bias. 

It can be a lot of fun, especially testing out new champs unique mechanics, but the biggest problem i have with the game are the bugs.

It's gotten to a point where you don't encounter them once in a blue moon, but rather you're gonna encounter bugs every single game.

Some aren't impacting the game at all, otherwhise actively negatively impact both fun and fairness, for example the bug where you don't get a horse but instead stay in first person perspective, and stay bugged until anything hits you.

If you can see past those bugs and enjoy the game for what it is, then have fun with it. I for my part have taken a long break, and at this point i still don't know if I'm mentally ready for those bugs again."
9760,love to play it with friends
9761,"Can be frustrating from the whinny 3min into the match quitters, but there IS a not too shabby Bots Mode if it gets out of hand. And the characters are so diverse that you can pick just the right one to end a cycle of losing for the same reasons in every match by learning a different one perfectly suited to fix that repeated problem. Over all, love the game and if you're NOT having a good time it's usually because you haven't learned enough characters yet."
9762,"Fairly fun! Seems generously balanced, though I do believe some champions are harder to use than others."
9763,game is pog

9770,Really Enjoyable Game
9771,fix yo **** hi-rez
9772,"I originally played on Xbox, highly doubt i will ever do anything with the game on pc, but from my console experience, if you only play the game a few days a month, this game is fine. You won't really notice too awfully many game breaking bugs or glitches. But i love this game. The items, loadouts, the entire game is just perfect for me. But it is absolutely unplayable. Devs can't (or won't) fix years old bugs, they rework perfectly balanced maps (stone keep 100% did not need a rework, it was completely fine. Frog Isle's rework clipped numerous locations, rendering a critical place that was used for out of combat healing completely useless. Bounce points are nowhere near realistic. Servers are laggy, and the devs basically tell you ""If you have a bug we can't fix, it's your internet"". Matchmaking is never going to be perfect in team vs team games like this, but holy shit. I remember one instance when I was in ranked, our top pick was grandmaster, and our bottom pick was silver. How can you possibly allow that? The concept of this game is god tier. The potential of this game is unmatched. But the execution and management of the game is absolutely unacceptable."
9773,guo
9774,Chill game to play with friends!!
9775,"Free game with awesome gameplay - online
diffrent champions , theres few bugs and lags in server but the game is so worth it !

9792,the bugs seem kinda sus and the lack of important game changing balance changes seems imposter levels of sus
9793,just better than overwatch
9794,"After a year of play.. it gets old quick.. new locations would make the game beter than just adding and combining marketings and games.... if your not playing every day youll just get beaten no real development you can do or get.. no things really like loots as it is a competition game now and not really for cassual play.. 

It’s free to play so try it... you might be the next champion of the world... but yeah.. you could be playing something more rewarding .."

9813,"ive played this game for a while on another console and now just started on pc and i gotta say, paladins is always a good time. as for game difficulty, im not one for super competitive gameplay and even i can find enjoyment in playing ranked. its a fun game to get into with friends and your performance really relies on your skills and less on the character you play. highly suggest!"
9814,"nothing, I love this game"
9815,good
9816,"good game most characters are kinda unbalanced and can get pretty sweaty and depends on the time you play  
if you want nerds or not but if you can get past the nerds its really fun for a F2P game but this is just my opinion but your opinion and experience can be different to mine."
9817,funny first person weapon game ha ha ha it go brrrrrrrrr

9820,"I've played this game on PS4 since it released on beta, got my account to lvl 50 and got the free volcanic makoa skin, got every champion (except for the new ones after talus cuz i stopped playing there) so now i'm playing it on the pc version and i'm still having as much fun!, though i wish i could still continue my progress from my ps4 account :("
9821,yes
9822,"It's pretty good for a free to play shooter game that imitates Overwatch a little bit (Yet Overwatch is just a graphically better TF2, to be fair) 

It's fast paced, has character classes and can be picked up and played at any time just like Fortnite or whatever quick-start games exist on the market. 
It's janky, it's goofy, it's good fun. Have at thee!"
9823,its ok
9824,"Verry good game, better than Overwatch in my experience"

9828,this game stinks
9829,"Paladins is an incredibly fun game (even if Bomb King is the most effective monarchist propaganda, lol), but good lord does it piss you off sometimes--plus the monetization sucks.

for more thoughtful recommendations of the best games on Steam, check out my curator, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38563966-The-Absolute-Finest/]The Absolute Finest[/url]."
9830,ive played this game since 2016 and from then i loved it
9831,"Game feels good to play, feels like a right balance between overwatch and battlerite. The card/talent system allow you to tailor loadout just to you, and the balance feels like there isn't a specific team comp one should be running. You can go without a tank or multiple flankers just fine, roles aren't set up in a way that's rock paper scissor. 

The art style I am not so fond of, feels very messy and not a polished as something like overwatch."
9832,"This game caught me out off guard, look I'm not a MOBA player at all, games like LoL and Dota never caught my attention. I think this game was more to those games, but when I play it man this game is really intense and fun! 
Love how you can do a lot of stuff, there's so many combinations and customization that change a lot of factors of the game. 
And this game is Free for real, you can play all the time you want and unlock everything. That's a plus too

One of the best games I played this year.

Cheers, Dieg."

9848,Overwatch if the the devs cared about the playerbase. Only real negative is that the competitive sucks and balancing of older champions.

9855,"make your unique play styles, technique, synergies, etc.
overall ""better than overwatch"" (just for me)

9856,"For free to play, pretty damn good"
9857, Paladins is a unique multiplayer experience for what it is and refreshing to jump back after your typical battle royal session.Give it some love it's completely free after all ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
9858,"The monetization is complete crap.  Even if you pay to have all of the characters unlocked, you're still going to be paying around 10 or more dollars for a skin.  The gold they give you in the game is used to unlock characters, but it's borderline worthless if you actually gave them money up front and bought the game to unlock the characters from the start.  What's more, almost all of the skins are locked behind loot box crap, and unlike Overwatch, you can't use your gold to buy the more desirable skins, only crappy recolors.  Combine all of this with a paid battlepass that locks you out of obtaining certain skins forever, and you've got a game that exists purely to milk you from your money.  Think about this:  would you rather have a 10 dollar skin or a whole new game on Steam?"

9866,"I feel this game is a must try. You'll have nothing to lose apart from time since it's free. It's an FPS 5v5 shooter game that is much less tactical than CS:GO or Valorant. It can be extremely competitive though and there are regular updates every few months to experience and enjoy. It's matchmaking and servers are not the best, and it does have a few bugs that have not been dealt with for a long time now, but there are also issues that were dealt with. You can also find incredible people in this game, shout out to my friend Phantomboy."

After playing it for over 1000 hours, I can confidently say that this game will not last if major changes aren't implemented. As it is, the engine is very broken and would probably take too long to fix or build from scratch. Game runs on Unreal Engine 3 which also doesn't help the devs make it playable.

The matchmaking system lacks in both casual and competitive, highest ranking players get put into the same match as newbies. 

It's not a dead game yet, just a dying one."

to Devs, maybe you should extend the matches a little since they feel too short. and thanks for making the game free."
9921,1/10
9922,(like) not Overwatch.

9924,"0 balance going on. Game will happy put a bunch of new/low level players up against stacks of high level players so you can get stomped game after game. Unable to even get out of spawn. Last game I had before uninstalling only one person on the team managed to even get a kill. Everyone else 0 kills, multiple deaths, 0 assists. The pay to win is also quite heavy with most of the ""champions"" being locked behind paywalls or extremely long grinds"

9955,Aaaaa
9956,"The more you play, the more you realize how actually bad this game is. It is super unbalanced, the community is god awful toxic, if you're a new player good luck, because you're gonna wanna quit withing your first day of playing. I would never recommend this game, even to my worst enemy"

9963,better than overwatch :)
9964,It is really fun
9965,"I like this game because first of all, it’s free. I’ve played this ever since I was 13 with my best friend almost daily but abruptly stopped when I turned 15 because I thought it was time to take school seriously, and mostly because my best friend went to a different school. It is fast paced and I get bored easily so that is a factor that makes me like it. The ability to customise cards, loadouts and an item shop makes it unique. You can be OP against the enemies depending on your custom loadout.  

Paladins is a free-to-play team-based first-person shooter game that has two opposing teams on either side of the map. The main goal of each team is to capture the objective in the middle of the map. Each team will need 4/4 points to win. Capturing is 1 point, and successfully pushing the payload is an extra point. The objective is a circle where each player can stand on, preferably the front line, in order to gain points. You need to get 100% in points. After capturing the objective, a payload will spawn in the objective circle. The payload is a cart filled with explosives that has its own route towards the enemy base. The team who has captured the objective will then push the payload in order to make it go forward. The enemy team can stop the payload from pushing forward by standing in the circle emitting around the payload. The opposing team needs to defend their base within a given time limit, if not contested. If the payload runs out of time before going to the enemy’s base circle, the team who captured the payload won’t have an extra point, otherwise if they successfully pushed the payload in the circle, they will gain an extra point. Whoever gets to 4 points first, wins.

There are four different classes: the tank, support, flank, and damage. The tank has a lot of HP and shielding skills that makes them the best for standing in the middle of the objective as long as they are constantly healed by the support. The support has team healing skills. Flanks specialize in mobility skills which allow them to flank the enemy from the sides or behind. Lastly, the damage class has the most damage output with their skills. You must have good aim, fast reflexes, good instincts, and the right timing to use each skill- unless you’re a damage class then go bonkers.


The game doesn’t require you to buy in game purchases in order to have an edge over the enemies, they simply sell cosmetics. Although, there used to be a time where a patch- the OB64 patch, made it pay-to-win. In order to upgrade the cards for the loadout, you had to open chests. You also had to obtain several similar cards in order to level each one up. The champions used were also much stronger at higher levels, resulting in an unbalanced game if your champion is a lower level. That system is now non-existent, thankfully. As for the benefits of buying cosmetics using real money, I guess you can distract the enemy by having better skins but I’m sure it’s only for the player’s satisfaction. There are certain items that can be bought using virtual game money by grinding the game daily, specifically the quests and events.

9992,This is an excellent game. I've played for a while on Xbox before moving to PC. The game itself is smooth and the matches are fun. The champions have unique customization's and new champions are constantly being released. The developers are quick to fix bug or overpowered builds. It doesn't take long to find lobbies and players with high level champions can even participate in a ranked mode if they so choose. The battle passes are affordable as well making purchased in game content easy on the wallet.
9993,"The game is fun, but some things may be developed further."
9994,warehouse version of overwatch but better somehow
9995,loved the 3 hrs I spent playing Overwatch
9996,i hate this game. HACKERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

10001,"Started playing from beta version, enjoyed it a lot and didn't play for years. Returned to it as I thought it would be fun to play again. But all of the last 10 games, I lost and was doing the most dmg with support. Had so many toxic teammates who would blame me or go afk. This game brought no fun back, was just suffering."

10010,very fun!
10011,So underrated game!
10012,"There are so many bad decisions that absolutely plague this game. Unable to change heroes during a game and backfill are the two biggest ones. If you don't have a healer, that's it. You're fucked the rest of the game. Double goes for any roles you don't have filled. No tanks = dead. No dps = dead. No flankers/good flankers = dead. And if anyone decides to leave, they're replaced with a very dumb bot.

And that's not to mention all the bugs that riddle this game. You can get locked into the same screen by accident if you simply get anything is one I run into almost all the time. Only fix is by ctrl alt deleting the damn game.

Oh, and this game is PLAGUED with microtransactions aimed at whales. It is so bad, it makes Warframe blush with envy. Can't even buy every individual skin for a hero, you gotta buy chests that each cost $8 and hope for a CHANCE to get them. That's not to mention the game intentionally locks you out of being able to complete the playable roster unless you're willing to grind hours every day(since the gold drop rate is pitiful), drop $8 on every single champion, or drop $10-$60 to get the full roster.

I get it's free to play, yet this game is nothing but predatory. I advise anyone and everyone to steer very clear of this blatant Overwatch rip off that doesn't even accomplish a FRACTION of things already established in the hero shooter genre.

You want a good hero shooter game that's not an excuse to be predatory?

Team Fortress 2."
10013,gud
10014,For me this is best
10015,Okay.
10016,"Good game overall. (In the same vane as overwatch tho very different with characters) this is a two-team, 1-objective game. There is also a TDM mode. (While there are cheaters I feel like most of them are caught by anti-cheat) almost all the new characters (when they first get dropped) are waaaay op, but they get balanced out as time goes on. It's ftp and not ptw so I do recommend."
10017,"Its great for what it is, fun to play scrims with friends. I have fun every so often and characters are somewhat cool"
10018,"i like this game its fun its free and its fun to play with friends

10023,"fun and broken game, great with friends"
10024,"Extremely underrated many hours of fun no pay to win stupidness , but if you wish to buy skins they have some pretty cool ones."
10025,"+10,000,000,000 Social Credit if you play this game"
10026,is good
10027,Overwatch but not
10028,"Free to play. Not pay to win. You can customize your character playstyle some healers can be damage dealers, tanks can be flanks, I am not talking about the meta ranked but playing with randoms you can try out many builds and have much fun changing your champion stats, skills and abilities. This is the first game I spend money on that is free to play. OB64 was disaster but game survived."
10029,"skye players are genuine pricks, hope you guys suffer greatly"
10030,"Simple and fun game to play with friends, if you have no friends to play this game with... dont. No need to learn a lot about in-game to be good, very intuitive. Recommended."
10031,"this game is so full of hackers and dumbass shit happening, but I can't lie that it's fun af, and that's all you need for a free game."

10054,iv been here since the very beginning  through all the paladins and overwatch comparisons and hate but paladins has standed the test of time and really carved out its own lane. the devs really love this game and keep fresh champions and content coming on the regular. there is a little that has changed through out the years that i dont really like but over all an amazing game and the pinnacle of hero shooters!!

10074,I actually really enjoy this game.
10075,recommended woohoo...
10076,"I like the concept of the game but it has its own fair share of problems. It can range from bugs within the map or bugs with characters. If you can aim in any other game this game will be easy for you because the hitboxes are pretty big and they don't match up with the character very well. If you have an average setup or average internet this game will crash quite a bit and the past few weeks before this post and during this post it has been crashing due to the servers and you will encounter lag where sometimes when you jump its a half jump then you get stuck floating in the air for a second then you float back down to the ground. Also with a lot of dash movements you will lag across the map depending on how well the game runs or how well the servers are doing. 

This game has a lot of ups and downs and if you like 5v5 pvp and you're new to gaming its nice to start out with but at some point you are going to see a lot of the flaws and not to mention this game isn't that friendly to new players. People will constantly blame you for the game whether it was your fault or not. I know every pvp game is toxic but I'm just saying this as a warning. Be prepared to deal with people that will go afk, throw, and just trash talk especially when you're new. Anyways I hope you enjoy the game in the mean time and don't get caught up in people talking trash."

10079,It's good

10082,good game
10083,its just bad. it has terrible game balance and isnt fun to play.
10084,"This game is fun I jumped right into it and I love it. I have never played Overwatch which I heard this game is similar to, but I do like this game. Controls are simple and matches are evenly contested. Gameplay is smooth for the most part and fun. It does get repetitive if you play the same character over and over in my opinion though. Overall I have recommended all my friends to this game and hope they enjoy it like I do."
10085,"easy n fun game you can play when you have free time.
Bots do ruin the game somewhat"
10086,fun free game
10087,"Terrible servers.
Otherwise an alright free game."

I enjoy part of the games, but I do not recommend it in it's present state.

There's very little character balance from what I've seen: Seriously, how is it normal that one character shoots faster and the other spawn a FLYING DRAGON who'll rekt you.

Unlike most games, I can't even tell when I'm about to die. It might be personnal to me, but I don't feel the UI is intuitive, same with the cards and build mechanics.

Finally, I do believe the game has potential, as I quite enjoy parts of the style and mechanics, just need a BIG work on the balancing, because that is a mess.

the game is good, i played since the beta, i don't have that much hours but still something to be proud of.

the skins are good some of them are thirsty and others... strange... 

anyways, now the game doesn't allow you to earn gems and other stuff like the beta but still i would spend moneys for the Ameri-khan skin.

10247,"Paladins is a great game! It's very similar to overwatch, but if I'm telling the truth, I like it more than overwatch. It has tons of characters and cool things. Of course, not as much content as it is free. The one thing about this game, the only reason I uninstalled and have so little hours on it is because it's difficult to play often or for long periods of time because it becomes boring or tiring. Grinding for coins used to buy characters is so difficult when you get tired after 3-5 games. Especially when you make so little coins. Anyways, thanks for reading! Comment if you disagree or have something to say, I'd love to hear it!"

10255,Sucks ass just play overwatch
10256,"character's special habilities certainly don't feel any special in this game, some characters dash, others dash faster, and some even dash twice, really great game design.
In a sea of mediocre characters, its funny how the Call of Duty generic guy sticks out for being the best at not being special what so ever.
The only character that I played and seemed to have some thought put into him was Atllas, the guy can shoot bullets that send enemies back in time, he can himself go back and even delete people from the time line with his ult, a very unique character lost in an unfortunate very broken and mediocre game.
Really, what is up with the docks map???? why is there a dock 100 meters far away from the center of the map with only one way to get there??? its impossible to play if there is a camper there, he alone can take control of the whole map by himself
Wtf.

Hi-Rez is a team of virgin morons that punish the players for their terrible servers. Now, that being said, if you want a game so unbelievably goofy that everytime you play, it's such a bad experience, that it turns into a GOOD experience, then this game is for you."

10277,"Now, i have way too many hours in this game as you can see, but to my defence i've played it since open beta, and this game has changed a lot, and i mean a lot. I've played through the 'Cards unbound' Update, and if you're an OG you know how bad that time period was for this game. Let's start with new players. If you come from Overwatch, this game will be a breeze in the park for you, if not, then it will be a bit harder for you to learn. This isn't a tutorial on how to play because they're plenty of guides for that, but the new player experience is quite challenging to say the most. I'm sorry, but unless i get in a game with other players i've seen or played with in the past, then i know the casual game has a 90% chance of either you destroying the other team (which may have only 1 good player on it) or you getting destroyed, very rarely is causal any fun unless you play in a party with good players. Comp. For OCE players like myself, as far as i am aware comp has been dead in that server for about 2-3 years +. During that time playing comp in OCE, i was diamond at the time, and i am not joking, i was versing legit paladins pros at the team (PPC or PPL is what they called it but there isn't a ESports scene for this game anymore as far as i am aware) even though they were both Grandmasters. I moved to SEA servers to play comp, where once again i was versing pro players in Diamond, Plat, and gold. Yes Gold (Im not bad i promise, i played with friends, Cope). My point with this is to let you know comp can and will mostly be balanced. Meta. I will tell you this right now, if you dont play 'Meta', and especially in comp, people will say very rude words to you, even if you drop 90+ Elims and 200k+ damage AND win the game (True story btw), they will still blame you. By me saying meta, im not talking about not picking a role that the team needs, eg not playing tank when you only have one or none, or not playing healer, im talking about characters, because for whatever reason, people don't care how good you are, and will have a sook if you dont play the character they want you to. So, if you want to try and get into this game, go ahead, it is fun, and i would't have 1200+ if it wasn't, it's easy to learn but hard to get into if you understand what i mean. But other than that i give it a 7/10"
10278,Tis a good game well at least in 2019. Didn't play it since so I don't really know anything since then.

I like the fact that all characters can be good if you're good at it, no one too op and no one too useless.
Of course like all game there's bug, put for this one there isn't that many that are harmful to the game unless you play for hours and accidentally find one.

this game is so freaking broken, that eventho its free to play its not worth it.

Worst free to play game i've played in a while and terribly broken........

dont play"

10303,"For Furries, By Furries"
10304,"I'm loving the game so far. Bit late to the party obviously, but i'm still getting matches quickly so I don't think it makes any difference. The sheer amount of characters in the game now and all with different abilities is amazing, I've been loving just trying each out and learning how to use the abilities for each properly.

A lot of characters, like the new one ""Trickshot"". First time I tried her I thought the abilities were rubbish and I hated it. Tried it again the day after and it just clicked and now shes awesome. You can basically lob a coin in the air and then shoot it to bounce shots at people (for higher dmg). It felt gimmicky at first, but once you realise you can use it to shoot around corners or if you are trying to capture an area - just lob the coin in the air, and shoot the hell out of it from relative safety whilst the dmg numbers ping all over the show, its awesome. 

Give it a shot, it's free for the most part and only costs if you want to unlock more heroes/costumes etc and honestly, it's well worth unlocking all the heroes just to play around even if you suck at it like i do.

10305,Game is realy good for free to play they put alot of effort in it
10306,this game is so nice
10307,"I mean, if you don't wanna pay for overwatch this is pretty good, still no friends to play with cause they all don't wanna play this game so, for me 8/10, for them IDK i just wanna play man"
10308,The game was good in 2018 maybeee 2019 after that 90% stuff that needed fixing did not get fixed nor changed...also MOST updates are just new chests skins and shit like that with horrible drop chances.Im surprised that the game isnt completely dead by now.
10309,nicheo wava raaa

10357,PAY TO WIN SHIT
10358,Cant launch the game on the first try. The process just hangs. I need to kill it through task manager and the restart it in order to play.
10359,Haven't played in a while and when I rejoined the game it was super easy to get back into and it has really smooth gameplay. Don't like when there are random popups when you die on screen as a death message but it seems like something that would make others have fun so I don't want to mind it
10360,kinda buggy but its fine once you get it running
10361,god
10362,Cheap and shit but still infinitely more fun than Overwatch sue me.
10363,"learning to play isnt that difficult, but the skill ceiling can be high. a large variety of characters that feel unique and makes sure you'll find someone you enjoy playing and are good with. art style is nice too, maps feel well made for the most part. only complaint is it takes a while to unlock characters without paying, but for a free game, its alot easier to than other ones i've played"

This is a hero shooter with tight controls, frequent updates, awesome events, value-filled battlepass, and some of the best replayability in the business. Paladins is a much more suitable game to carry TF2's torch than Overwatch ever was, and is absolutely worth a try."

10451,"For a free game, paladins is definitely worth the download, takes a few hours before understanding the game and then it becomes very fun. Very similar to Overwatch, I've played both games and still play both, with paladins prevailing as more fun due to the less edge of the competitive and toxicity side of overwatch. Have over 100 hours on steam and much more on Xbox. Unlike overwatch, you can link your game accounts on paladins, which means i didn't have to start over when switching from Xbox to PC. Definitely worth it for anyone interested."

ONCE MORE I RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISE"
10470,"TL,DR: I cannot recommend the game at it's current state, even if it isn't at its worst there's a lot of room for improvement.
that being said it is a good game to play very casually and it can be a replacement for other hero shooters.


This game has a 50/50 win-rate policy. the more you win, it will match you against better and better players and put in your team worse and worse player, thus making it really hard for you to win. I've seen games with 3-4 GM's or masters in one side and pure silver or gold players in the other, this will not be an issue if you are mostly an average player, but if you have played games like this before at semi-high level you will notice it quite soon.

It's really hard to acquire Champions if you don't buy the packs or buy crystals, most of the good champions are really expensive so you either know which one to buy or you lament for a long time for not having enough gold to buy them.

The game doesn't have a kill cam, they removed it because they couldn't fix it and I fear they may never implement it again. On that note, not knowing how the others killed you WILL lead to frustration, and will probably hinder the ability to understand other champion's gameplay style (having the first person camera of someone playing it well, specially when you can see how you were playing when they killed you, it's a massive tool to learn how to counteract a champion, improve your gameplay or even know if a champion is fun to play without having it yourself)

People that AFK/Alt+F4, Feed, Insult or are plainly Smurfing (that are reported) will never get taken actions against, only cheaters have a chance and only if you write it explicitly in the comment and choose the ""OTHER"" category.

Finally, it tends to run horribly in many not-high-end pc's seemingly for no reason, has many Visual bugs and gameplay bugs, colliding with other people makes your character stutter (in some rare occasions you both get clipped and push each other upwards until you collide with the ceiling), many collision boxes don't match the visual models specially in new maps.

Finally queue times can be very long for ranked (10+ minutes is the norm for me) and casual can also go for 4+ minutes in queue, also the queue system not always makes sense.

10485,"Its better than overwatch imo, the game itself is free so theres already one benefit, the reason this game doesnt cost money is cause its not made by a larger corporation. Hi-rez does their best to fix bugs and keep servers running, the game still has users and going back into the game after almost a year of not playing i got a queue wait time of about a minute or two.

10539,"thats nice 
 games thx 
"
10540,"Idk how to rate this game, more of a neutral rating than a purely negative one,

- I somehow clocked 160+ hours, but I will admit a vast majority of it was because its a free game that I can play with friends. So I'll give Paladins this much credit, first of all: it offers a free co-op experience and that's good.

- Further, I must say I really like the deck system and I think other class/character-based arena shooters should learn from it.

- I'm also a huge fan of certain champions: whoever made the turret man a tank with utility mini-sentries deserves a damn raise firstly, what a good take on an otherwise boring trope. Fernando also gets compared to OW's Renhardt a lot but Fernando feels completely different and much more dynamic. And then there's heroes straight out of left field like Atlas, Mal'damba, Imani, that I just love for being so original.

But my experiences with the gameplay itself overall aren't positive,

- 19 out of 20 games I'm either stomping or getting stomped, and stomping doesn't even feel good because I'm just afk on a point for half the game watching my opponent's death timers.

- While the characters are an overall positive, there's one or two that are truly questionable. Like that Vivian character just...left clicks. That's it, that's her entire kit. Either she's utterly busted like she was a year ago or she's terribly weak. How do you plan to balance this?

- Also kind of tired of the current roster. As much as I like the heroes, as a tank main I've been playing the same 10 folk for god knows how many games and Hi-Rez promises 1 char per year. Meanwhile fraggers have 28 options! No wonder everyone wants to hog DPS, heck, even I want to now that I write this.

- The game itself is pretty scuffed from a technical standpoint. Friends and I regularly experience crashes/disconnects, frame drops, loading screen sounds getting super loud and blowing our eardrums. Some textures and shaders lately have also started showing up as blurry/not fully loaded (mid settings, and I have a 11-month-old 3060 that runs AAA titles just fine). Not sure what can be done about these issues but its pretty annoying."

10551,noice
10552,"Don't play this game, Its a game that is ridden with bugs some multiple years old, matchmaking is poor and someone crashes most matches.
But most of all, don't play it because it's Hi-rez.
This is a developer who doesn't care about the player at all, its not about the game, its about how much money they can get from you as they endlessly chase trends without the understanding that they have had something potentially great yet squandered it.
They see the player as lesser than them, intentionally antagonising the player base and acting holier than tho down at the pleasantry, straight up telling the community to ""deal with it""
This company did the same thing with Tribes Ascend years ago, they did their absolute best to burn the bridge between the community and the developers going so far as to pull old favourite maps because their rework was getting criticism, not because it was bad, but as a punishment, said so by the developers themselves.
And here Hi-rez is doing the same thing again, when a skin for the community received backlash the art lead intentionally made a followup skin called salt just to piss people off. When a new champion doesn't get people calling
This is an art lead that consistently rips off other IP's with champion designs, from Warhammer 40k Space Marines, Tyranids, Mortal combat, Doom, Diablo, all the edgy games and IP's. It's like having a Deviant Art teenager who grew older but never grew up and out of his deviant art era mentality. Any criticism, constructive and justified or not is met with derision and ""I troll you"" mentality.

But sure, if you don't care about any of that and just want to play the game casualy, lets look at how it plays
The game is not stable, it has not been stable for years. whether or not the game is playable depends day to day, servers barely run with hit detection being as much as 4 seconds behind and input delay being just as bad. One can go several matches in a row with someone on their team crashing and disconnecting. Ranked is no better, just while I am writing this I saw a new video clip of someones ranked match crash to menu when they were seconds from winning a ranked match.
The draw of being able to make loadouts and play a champion the way you like is sadly not something that is a reality, as several times when a champion has a alternative way to play that is outside what is intended it gets nerfed, as such for many champions there is one way to play.
Animation bugs are in every match and for every champion, and entire features (third person mode and killcams) have been removed to fix them only for said bugs to remain in the game over a year later.
Several maps are getting reworked despite the community asking for new maps, while the game has several in progress maps from over 2 years ago still playable in custom mode. When the Maps do get a visual rework, they come with clipping, Textures that do not align with the map mesh, sometimes broken lighting, ultra heavy ramps that cause one to be unable to walk up them and entire area's the only certain characters can get to.

Monetiseation is centred solely around whales, with skins releasing in limited time lootbox chests exclusively, lackluster battlepasses, and direct to buy skins sitting at around $15 a pop.

So, when the Art director says that the recent skin was released because the community fucked around and found out. he is right, they have been fucking around and are going to find out the result, maybe not today, maybe not next month but at somepoint.

TL:DR the devs are malicious in their attitude towards the player, have not learned from their mistakes, and the game is buggy"
10553,"More fun than overwatch, plus boobs. 10/10"
10554,yup
10555,"Game is amazing and fun for starters, i have been playing since beta on the ps4 and i don't plan on stopping ever since i got a laptop just to play it.
Balance is the only problem but that's the caveat you get from a game where playing as a tank or a support doesn't feel like you are useless like other games.  
Art Style is not that great, but it makes the game run on virtually any potato/toaster pc, and to be fair, recent skins are incredibly detailed.
Updates regularly with mayor updates every 2 months and patches aren't big to the point of being a headache.
Its not hard to start, but difficult to master due to the complex load out system and talents.
9/10 not perfect but addicted
Ps. if you play Strix or Kinessa please touch grass.

If you're on the fence about anything, just download it and give it a try with a few matches. It's worth the time to do so, because it shows a lot more developer attention and care than most other hero shooters on the market right now."
10641,"Its a nice game. Usually when you lose, it doesn't really make you too mad, so its the vibe"
10642,"I'M NOT ADDICTED I SWEAR
Please support the devs, this is a solid entry in the game industry <3"
10643,Sip

10645,nice
10646,great

10678,Best game ever😍😍
10679,yes
10680,"I Hate it when the game doesn't let me play; I really want to play ranked but it wont let me.
Picked my game mode with my controller, picked my character in game with a controller, picked my loadout with a controller, exited the game with my controller. I WANT TO PLAY WITH MY CONTROLLER.
Don't care how you do it just make it happen; The only reason Overwatch is better is because it lets you play with a controller."
10681,"oooga
"
10682,`1
10683,Iv played this a lot on stream when my friend is playing my level is not high but fun game with friends almost like overwatch type game and plus its free to play
10684,good!
10685,For over a year now this game will not install correctly. This is a known issue for at least 4 years. Obviously the developers do not care enough to make sure the installation process works.
10686,"Many say its an overwatch clone.
In a handful of ways it kind of is.
BUT(T)
I have to say I've enjoy this game more over overwatch. Things are more controlled and ""tame"" I would say.
It's fun, free and enjoyable.
Only draw backs are the skins costing a bit much and locked behind crates through a rotation.
"
10687,I'm hooked and I can't stop playing. ;-;
10688,"This game was great for the first few months I played but later on the game started to lag. Every update seems to make the lag worse and the game is barely playable or unplayable at times. Many others have experienced the same thing and I heard its been going on for years now. 

TLDR: The Lag is so bad its almost impossible to get a good match and the Devs don't seem to care!"
10689,Great game !
10690,its really fun to play
10691,better than overwatch.
10692,for big virgins
10693,decent game
10694,"its overwatch, but free"
10695,"Fun. Not competitive. Fun. 

Thousands of hours worth of fun. With 50+ champions, 10+ maps, 3 game modes (+ a limited time mode on the weekend) and a new champion, event pass and challenges every two months, there is lots to do. 

Just don't expect the most polished, well balanced shooter. Expect to have fun, not train for tournaments.

Fun. Very fun."
10696,fort
10697,It's fun :)
10698,good
10699,"Nice game overall but the graphics and ideeas of the game its blend a little.
It needs more optimization and balancing for tanks since theyre very OP just like on LoL.
Overall I think the game needs more optimization and not ruin things anymore"
10700,"Better than OW in a number of ways, and I've tried both."
10701,goog
10702,it is fun

10705,i like man
10706,"Fun game. Would play more but I have other games to play. If your bored and want to get something, this is it,"
10707,Matchmaking in this game is bullshit. Keep getting low level players in team while enemy team's players are well over level 150+. Fix your matchmaking Hi-Rez
10708,"People keep comparing paladins to overwatch. overwatch is okay at best, but paladins blows it out of the water.
Paladins has better character variety, each character can be customized to fit your playstyle, and unlike overwatch, it's community isn't everywhere and loud as hell. but be warned. if you're a fanatic for skins, your wallet will disintegrate. i've spent hundreds of dollars on chests due to my insatiable need for furry, robot and fantasy skins. seriously though, this game has what i call ""the furry tax"", where furry stuff costs several times what everything else costs. don't believe me? look at skin prices. 9 out of 10 times, the furry or scalie skins cost several times the price of other skins. 

TL;DR, if you're a furry seeking representation, or someone obsessed with cosmetics, this game will drain your wallet dry. good game tho. (i mostly play on ps4.)"
10709,"yes

10722,Gud
10723,"The cards and talents add a lot of depth to the gameplay. There is a lot of player expression since a healer can play flank and a tank can play damage and so forth. As a player I do not feel restrained to a ""meta""."
10724,"Undeniably and uncontrollably fun. For those that don't want the toxicity of Overwatch yet the ultimate goodness of hero class shooters, you NEED to get this game. Plenty of ways to win without spending obscene amounts of money, and it's super easy to get fairly good at this game."
10725,ok
10726,bad
10727,"This game has a ton of potential to become bigger than it is, but the only thing holding it back is some polish. 
1: This game desperately needs skill based matchmaking for one thing, it's not fun for new players the get stomped by already experienced players who find it more fun to crush newbies and casuals than to actually play against others at their level. 
2: Some reworks to the currently available champions would also be a good focus. Some of their kits have just filler cards that don't really do anything.
I hope the devs would stop pumping out champ after champ and just focus on what they already have."

10747,"This is not a bad game. Diverse characters, all with interesting abilities and different ways to play them. I firmly believe you can make almost anything work in this game. The reason I can't recommend this game is because it literally wastes your time. I have over a thousand hours in this game, and I guarantee 500 of them have been me stuck in the main menu screen because of some server connection issue I had in the match or some kind of issue that has everyone getting sent back to the lobby. This game is amazing with friends and even if I get sent back to the lobby countless times this game has so much value  when playing with friends and can expand the entertainment tenfold. But do not play alone. Fix your fucking servers and optimization instead of having a competition at the office to create the character with the most sex appeal you lobotomized zombies."

10758,fun little game to play with pals
10759,"I like how there's several different game modes, it helps keep it fresh. There's a ton of characters with different abilities, something like 60 of them, and each one can then be modified through talents and cards to customize your play strategy. The only problems with this game are that sometimes the balance of power between characters can be get lopsided, and the game is slightly pay to win (you can use your credit card to purchase in game money, but it's also possible to earn it through gameplay). Overall I would highly recommend this game, it's a lot of fun"

""oh nice we got 3 level 5s on our team against a grandmaster 25000"" sums it up. stop adding characters we don't need another pistol witch we need you to start caring about your game"

The devs are active, constantly updating, adding and balancing, and the gameplay is fun. The champions are great fun to play as, and no single champion stays overpowered for too long. I would definitely recommend this game - over pretty much all games of the genre."

10826,fun
10827,"I've just started playing. Less than a week.

At first it was fun, but I can already tell you in the time I've played this game, it is not worth your time.

I thought the matchmaking was dog****, I mean its my 3rd day and I'm playing against someone with Mastery 50+ on a character due to seeing them with Mastery skin, and they are in a 5 stack of coordinated players completely annihilating my team? And I'm in a duo with my friend that just started with me? One of my randomly matched teammates didn't even buy items bro. Like... the ****.

I go to look on the forums and reddit and the matchmaking has been dog**** for years. 

Clearly the developers do not give a **** about having a fair and enjoyable experience.

I played a match where I was tank and had the most objective time and damage on the team, and my teammate and the enemy team flamed me after the match. Like... bro what the **** was I supposed to do. Toxic *** game bro.

When you think of this game, you probably think FTP Overwatch. A better game, a just as toxic of a cesspool. But at least Overwatch comes with matchmaking that works. So I guess there's that. Would rather deal with lootboxes and terrible teammates in comms than a dysfunctional game."

10858,"Ahhhh jumping back into Paladins, after around 3 years, feels so good.The nostalgia hit hard, since this was my free overwatch dose back in the day.It's your typical moba shooter,with its charming cartoon-ish graphics,tons of champions, with more releasing each season and a fairly in depth customization system to suit your playstyle .At its core, Paladins hasn't changed much, since i played it last time and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Matchmaking is fast and the timeframe to pick champions/load in between games feels shorter(which was my only complaint back then.You could literally brew some coffee in between matches! ).
Apart from that there's a lame season pass,not very rewarding for playing free, but oh well HiRez gotta make some cash after all.
In conclusion Paladins is a unique multiplayer experience for what it is and refreshing to jump back after your typical battle royale session.Give it some love it's completely free after all ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
10859,"Game is now full of smurfs, hackers and nubs. When you win, its against nubs. When you lose, they are either high diamond master smurfs, or hackers. Hackers in roughly 1/2 games. Drop hacks, soft aimbots, wall hacks, tab to target. They turned off kill cams and play of the game to hide it years ago."

They ruined Seras' invisibility by giving it a three month wind-up, and they fucked up Talus' charge attack by making the hurt-box smaller than his dick. Also you can no longer have separate head pieces so the cute Kabuki make-up he has on under the Oni skin is now just hidden forever, but you Hi-Rez.

Bring back third person mode or I will do something drastic. I won't stop playing or anything, I'll probably just complain on the sub-Reddit like the good incel I am.

10880,"A very enjoyable game with meaty hitboxes, the kind of game that is the inbetween of a moba and a class shooter, with surprisingly a lot of customization for playstyles. 50 characters that you can pick and surprisingly extremely detailed models that increase in quality for each new character. Saati is a real fun character for hand cannon enjoyers. Its the sort of game that is not for everyone, but even after taking a near 4 year break or more I still have a lot of fun whenever i feel the whim to come back to play the game."

10900,"Nice gameplay fast and easy to learn, But because of crossplay sometimes some characters have advantages over PC players. I recommend turning on Keyboard only in crossplay. Rest is very Good, would recommend it to everyone."
10901,"Terrible servers, horrible community manager, devs ignores players and player toxicity is just as bad as bad players.

Recap: still better than overwatch"
10902,"Very fun
"
10903,"1. I feel that there are some cheetah and bugs exploit in champions abilities

2. horrible matchmaking in ranked
2.1 strength of player are unbalanced in matchmaking
2.2 as a solo player, you can get vs a whole premade team in matchmaking
2.3 long time for matchmaking (like 3 min wait time for each matches or something)
2.4 they force you to buy 16 shitty champion (the less expansive ones) in order to access ranked matches
2.5 as a solo player you are very reliant on your teammates to do certain stuff in order to perform
2.6 low player base in ranked matches, you will play vs same ppl again and again.
2.7 it is always the same type of matches (no tdm or the other one)
2.8 if you get roasted first match, enemy team gets much more points and therefore more abilities on 2nd match and so on, making it very hard to come back. 
2.9 free rotation champ not available in ranked matches
2.10 basicallly you look forward to go into ranked matches for several days and then it is just awful.

3. takes too long to get gold in order to buy champions (and when you do get gold, it is  in an inconsistent way too)
...even after 44 hours of playing and some watching youtube video, I still have no clue where the majority of my gold comes from and how to get more in a consistant way...this is sort of awful..."

10952,"It's pretty fun when you get into it, lots of character variety and plenty of depth with the card system. Sure, certain builds are more viable than others, but it ultimately leaves that choice up to you. I just wish I could get my friends to play it without calling it an Overwatch ripoff. I've played OW before and it got old pretty quickly, at least for me. Only thing I could say I like about Overwatch a bit more is the cosmetics are easier to come by and you don't have to unlock the heroes. But Paladins is F2P, so I can't exactly fault it for that. Regardless, if you like hero shooters, you could certainly do a lot worse than Paladins."

Its a little slow at first, having to unlock all of the champions (unless you buy the champion pack), but once you do, its very fun to customize the card sets and goof around with trolly builds. I will say that if you are willing to spend a little money, at least get the champion pack, its, in my opinion, the best and most usefull one."

10965,"Why does every fun game have to be ruined by its toxic fan base. 


No matter how perfect of a teammate you are someones always gonna find a way to flame you for their problems. Don't even bother trying to fight back because you're always wrong. You will always be fighting a losing battle talking to the amazing players who think they know whats best for you.

My steps for enjoying this game.
1. Mute the hell hole that is known as the chat when things start to ramp up.
2. Always party up with people. Be it friends or people from discord/etc. Solo queuing will most likely end up a disaster.

The actual game is real fun. Don't let the toxic players ruin your day. Because they have already ruined mine.

11012,"Hi-Rez used to be a decent enough company.  I was thrilled to see someone picking up on the 'Tribes' FPS line and Hi-Rez came out with Tribes Ascend; a decent rendition of a classic with as much fealty to the original game as one could imagine.  However,  after playing Paladins for more than a year, it become woefully apparent that the leadership and management of this company veered sharply away from producing quality gaming but rather diving into the realm of woke politics.  I simply don't care to support a company that treads into the miasma of virtue signaling, woke-ness, and the quagmire of gender politics.  Gaming should be devoid of these elements, and to do otherwise is both divisive and ostracizes a good percentage of people/players that just want to frag another hapless victim online.  Perhaps should Hi-Rez renounce these futile platitudes, I could see myself once again enjoying the games they have and would produce in the future.  Until then, stay out of politics."

Hard to reccomend if you're not playing with friends. It is one of the better hero shooters available on the market right now, so if you're into that it's good. Until Overwatch 2 releases or TF2 posts an actual update, this is probably one of the most prominent hero shooter that is still actively being updated with real content and not just balance changes."
11031,"No ultrawide support, apparently it makes you ""unfair"" since this is a competitive game. 

Seems like CS:GO, Overwatch, Battlefield, Planetside, PUBG, DOTA2, Rainbow Six.... Aren't mainstream competitive games like Paladins, since all of them support 21:9 , 32:9 etc...

11075,I do not recommend this game because the fking client is crashing every 2nd game. And theres alot of games more evolved that have option to pause the game.
11076,"I have played since open beta (over 2k hours total) and I can say that all this time game was only degrading. Graphics was made more and more cartoonish. Most of the characters are already so nerfed that there are barely enough playable characters in the ranked for 2 teams - it's almost impossible to see some kind of variety. On the one hand, almost all maps have been graphically updated recently, but some have become less functional, some have been removed from the ranked. Matchmaking always was s h i t - people with difference in ranks about 10 divisions can appear in one team (In ranked), Account level is also used in matchmaking now: High-level players stand in a queue (in ranked) about 1-2 minutes and low-level ones - about 7-15 (match itself  can be short er than queue). A few words about in game currency: It's time to carry out the denomination. Old players have millions and new players will need a lot of time to unlock all characters if they play for free. And the last blob that overwhelmed my patience and made me write this review - an unacceptable ban policy based on user reports: anyone can be banned based on user reports, for example, reports for AFK or feeding. (without doing anything, just because there always will be a certain number of trolls who will report you to a low score), while the support essentially does not answer anything and then stops responding at all. Previously, I sometimes donated for skins (they are sometimes quite good), but after such a boorish attitude I will never pay a cent in the games of these developers again. I can't recommend this game to anyone."

To be honest- the game is good, it's really fun.
The only problem is the balancing of the champions, a few bigger bugs that are- ""popular""(With that i mean that almost every player knows this one bug, that destroyes the game exept you know what to do so you don't get that bug)
Anyways, one of the problems still is the community, one part are really really nice player, the other side are... toxic player that only watch on the kill count(How many kills you did) in my opinion as a healer or a tank you get told that you are so bad (Only if you are with toxic people obviously xD) and that you don't heal anyone, even if you do you get that told many times.
As a new player you really only can hope that you get nice player, but as i said not everyone is like that.
One good thing, if you are completely new(Lvl 0 and a bit more i think) you will automatically play training matches for a few rounds(Means you play against bots)
But besides that it makes fun(I know i repeat myself very often xD)
Btw, don't get too involved with spending money on this game, it's like an addiction. (But you don't have anything from this, you know skins, emotes, sprays, that's all)
Soo, if i recommend it:
-If you can handle toxic player, yes
-If you can't handle toxic player, more a no, it's the best if you ask a friend to play with you and explore it with them, so you at least have one person that supports you and helps you get into the game and says what you can change on your way to play this champion and stuff.

But don't forget, this is only my experience, so if you play it, it may be a different experience!"

I've met people in this game that have changed my life in ways I could never fully describe. Not a good game. Not even a great game. Simply a perfect melting pot of genres and ideas with a constantly changing metagame balanced around ""intentional features"" and... lets just say questionable balance from the developers. A beautiful piece of art from the beginning of my journey to its yet to be seen end, the beauty of what once was a simple MOBA style FPS to an ever expanding 50+ character game finally feeling like it has the potential to be a market juggernaut, I will truly never forget my experiences playing this game.

11129,"Alright, let me get this straight. I LIKE and play Paladins but I DON'T recommend it to other new players in its current state. Let me explain. 

The problem this game faces is the failure of gaining any sort of traction. In 2016, the game came out of alpha and went into beta. This was a significant leap for Hi-Rez Studio because it was finally getting recognised by the media. The problem is this...Overwatch came out the same year. Of course, Overwatch's high resolution graphics was more desired than Paladin's  graphics resolution that looked like it was from 2012.  Due to Overwatch's overwhelming popularity, all of the achievements and milestones made by the Hi-Rez Studio got trampled over and Paladin's player base decreased significantly day after day. 

So what do they do? 

They started introducing champions like there was no yesterday. 

Now technically this would not be a problem if they had balanced champions as the new one come out, even the one that got introduced...but they did not balance anything. Hold on. Let me correct myself; its not that they did not balance anything is just the things they change is either irrelevant to the current ""unbalance"" or they make it even more unbalanced. Im just not talking about skill-wise; for all the people that say ""Oh, your just bad at the game and therefore you blame it on the game"". I WISH that it was that easy. Wait until you have met with a squad of 2 Hard Tanks that have ""infinite health"" and you would agree with me. 


 It is so blatantly obvious that Hi-Rez is competing with Overwatch with ""who can introduce a new champion the fastest?"" and this was what devastated Paladins. The balance of the game is so overthrown now (due to the lack of balancing) , the game is barely playable. If you met with a squad of Viktor, Yagorath, Raum, Dredge, Maeve, you would absolutely get destroyed. No questions asked. 

This is not even my opinion, Paladins itself is self-aware of this fact as they bans unbalanced champions  from ranked matches...on the day I learnt this, I was absolutely shell-shocked. 

Even now, in 2021, Hi-Rez have not changed a single thing about its strategy of combating against competition. In this 9 months alone, they  introduced 4 new champions. That might not seem like a lot but in the case of not balancing the game, suddenly it seems that they hold the game's fate in their hands. 

The second major problem of this game beside balancing is Hi-Rez Studio itself. Let me give you a few example: in 2019, they introduced Realm Royale, in response to the  popularity of  Fortnite but that game died in 3 months. This year, they introduced Rogue Company, in response to the popularity Valorant. You see the problem here? They abandoned the game that people loved and would have played if it was WORKED on, and instead they chose to follow the trend. Most of the dedicated players in Paladins would have supported Hi-Rez if the game shut downed for 1 year to work on its balance and overall mechanics. Look at it. The players are screaming at the creators for help but instead the creators chose to not listen and decided to abandon the game that they worked on for 4 years. 

It is so disappointing, as beta players like myself, see the game that have so much potential gets wasted away. See the game that I once loved gets abandoned by its creators. There is very little hope I have for this game to get better. I guess Hi-Rez is just waiting for this game to die out and shut down the servers and work on their next victim. 

(Edit: I went and looked at other people's POSITIVE reviews (cause Im still very surprised that this game is getting majority ""very positive"" for reviews on steam. 

And I have to say this: NO OFFENCE to anybody but it seems like people forgive this game's bugs and developers' laziness just because this is a free game. THIS is not a valid excuse nor is it a good one...no developers should be forgiven for their laziness and greed just because it is free; in fact the opposite should be true. The  developers for free games should aim to work HARDER then paid games to stomp on the idea of MONEY is EVERYTHING and if the game does not have funds, it will be stupidly bad. (I know this is easier said then done, but with enough passion, this can work [I am fully aware of bankruptcy and economic issues, but passion is what I believe in. ]). Anyways, thats all I have to say for the positive reviews that says the game is good cause its ""free"".)"

11135,Very cool. Runs great!
11136,"Its fun and free! Its a good game to play with friends or by yourself, especially ever since they added the training modes against AI bots that have no wait times to get into and also still earn xp and coins. Down side is that with some of the changes to the game, it is more grindy now. For example to get characters that cost a lot of coins, certain quests in the game (Trials of the realms) can be hard and require certain characters to complete, and the minimal cosmetic options for coins while a majority of cosmetics require crystals which can basically only be obtained by using real money and are used on chests for a chance of getting the cosmetic you want. If they just made everything obtainable through coins, even if an absurd amount, then the grind would be worth it and improve the quality of the game. The gameplay mechanics are great though with each character having unique abilities and ways of playing them, with customizable loadouts to further enhance your style. Also the games atmosphere, characters, and overall aesthetic is very pleasing to look at. I would recommend and Hi-Rez i will take any in game compensation you wanna throw my way lol"

11164,"Ubelievable. The game has been going for 5 years and with each update they take away more things in favor of other useless features, the game is full of bugs, some even making the game unplayable ex: when it disconnects in the midlle of a match.
 It shows that HI-REZ really doesnt give a fuck about paladins anymore because it doesnt make them any more money, they ignore what the fanbase wants and keep adding skins and characters when the game needs polishing on the existing champions, bugs and game modes. Its a shame the game is most likely going to die like this because at one time it was really fun, but after that, iy kept going downhill.

Edit: Game is even worse. I dont know who fucks me in the ass more, Evil Mojo or the horrible matchmaking."

11175,only bots I sleep
11176,"So the game took my money for a skin and didn't give me the skin. The dev's don't respect your time or your money, everything worth getting is locked behind loot boxes and battle passes. I'm fine with putting some cash down for a cool skin to support the game, but not random chance garbage. But even in game currency is terrible like i said i spent 30k gold on a skin and the game took my gold just fine but didn't give me the skin. The game is also very shady in terms of rewards. The game will tell you you earned 7k in game currency after a match but you will still have the same amount as before you went into said game. this game is not worth my time it doesn't respect me and i'm adding to to the ignored list after this post. you guys do what you want."

11196,"Its not competitive, but it is fun. just enjoy it and do not take it to seriously."
11197,"This game is absolutely amazing. 1,000,000x better than overwatch, Best hero shooter ever. 

Pros: 
-F2P, only cash items are cosmetics
-Amazing lore
-Varied champions designs, everything from lore to abilities to play style.
-You can win with almost any team composition. I have personally won games with all flanks.
-No matter how many matches I play, I always come back for more. In the last 3 days I've logged 8.9 hr
The community is helpful from the questions I've asked.

Cons: 
-Almost every cosmetic is Crystal instead of gold, and Crystals can be hard to grind. Luckily they added Trials Of The Realm, which has one challenge that nets you 50.
-Some champions, more specifically gun champions, are basically OP cuz of high fire rate. 
-Some champion abilities are BS, like one champion who summons a dragon which kills you in about .4 seconds.
-Only 3 game modes.

all in all a pretty good game to sink your time into. 10/10"

11201,لعبة مضحكة أحب جلودهم الساخنة
11202,Paladins is a really fun game with easy mechanics and controls with minimal requirements for pc. I never had a gaming computer so it was amazing playing a FPS on a computer without it lagging or having issues. I love the characters and the designs of weapons. The only bad thing is that the price for skins and characters is way too high without getting the battle pass. The game should still be fun for free players and I think that it would better if the skins/other cosmetics were cheaper. Still a very good game though.
11203,better than over watch. and its free plus you dont have to deal with all the bs from over watch. the gameplay is fast and fun the champions are unique and skill based and again ITS FREE
11204,This is budget overwatch imagine how bad overwatch currently is and multiply that by 10 for this game
11205,"Pros..best hero shooter bar none, great characters and designs
Cons... not the most balanced game, terrible community, rampant blatant cheating unlike any game I have seen
bugs and lots of them

While the base game is amazing, the experience is marred by frequent obvious cheating (people spamming ults with little to no cooldown) and matches that are lost because toxic community members love to start arguments with each other. It's a shame because the game itself is excellent. 
"
11206,"Let's keep this simple, people are comparing this to Overwatch for good reason. So let's do that;

- Paladins has better team diversity then Overwatch.
- Paladins has a better gameloop and progression system then Overwatch.
- Paladins is more forgiving and casual then Overwatch.
- Maps in Paladins are more balanced and fair to both teams then Overwatch.

but there are things that are not so great with Paladins:
- Overwatch has a better custom game system then Paladins.
- Overwatch is better looking and more polished as a whole then Paladins.
- Overwatch has few to no bugs compared to the buggy-ness of Paladins.
- If you are looking for heart-stopping, Butt puckering and Blood for sweat type of gameplay then Overwatch is more competitive then Paladins.

Most people play games for fun, to get enjoyment out of it. To some people this is to become the best at something, for others it's just killing people in a match and then there are some that just want casual fun and do not care if they win or loose and just want a game that gives them some sense of progression.

Overall I think that Paladins is the better game. It's free to play and you don't have to spend one cent to get into the action. You can play to earn gold that you can use to unlock other champions, or if you want to cut to the chase you can buy a DLC and unlock all of them, which makes gold earning almost useless. You unlock talents for the heroes you play and if you hit lvl 50 you unlock a special gold skin for your champion to show off. It has bugs and it doesn't do so well in the custom game/settings department but that is a trade off. It's your choice in what you believe matters more.

In Overwatch you get all the heroes and there are less of them. They will always play the same and the maps are highly focussed towards the defending team (as they spawn at the point the enemy team must push towards). Unlocking skins for both games is the same, spend real money and buy a crate that gives you random stuff.

Anyway.. They are similar in many ways and it's up to you what you like more. Either go for a smooth game experience, nice graphics and highly competitive OR go for a better gameloop, champion progression and more enjoyable/casual game sessions."

They added task that only give you 20 crystals and locked them behind a impossible task wall.

This game is purely a money grab. you only get good skins if you pay for them, otherwise you are stuck with very bad looking base skins for 90% of characters. 

The servers are horrible and you get lots of lag, and now games are filled with BOTs and not players. AVOID

I've tried time and time again but it's just too much. and oh god i know the battle pass is for hi-rez to make more money and rode the game pass trend fortnite made, but it really just makes that hero pack of all the heroes i bought years ago a worthless waste of money now.

i wish i could still like this game, at heart it feels the same, but there's too much content now and being added so frequently it feels impossible to keep up. as though hi-rez are doing anything to keep the game alive and make some money."

As someone who is learning the game it was extremely frustrating. After doing some research I found out that theirs is a lot of smurfs because meta hasn't changed and people are tired of losing if they don't play the meta, and to add on that queue time is still long. If you are an OW refugee like me look else where unfortunately this game is in a worse state then the state of OW right now."

. It's free and the champions don't take long to earn through in-game means. No purchases necessary.
. It's extremely well balanced except a couple champions that don't even matter because they'll be patched soon due to them being new and they just immediately get banned in ranked.
. I like that you can't change champions mid-battle. That was my major problem with Overwatch.
. The characters all feel fun and useful. Even champions that are old can still very much so hold their weight. 
. All the skins and voice actors are really good. Art style is fun as well

TLDR: Game is fun, in my opinion it's better than Overwatch, and it's got my recommendation."
11281,"yes
"
11282,I think this is the overwatch 2 everyone's been talking about
11283,"although the game can be buggy at times and slighly toxic (as most pvp games are) its still pretty fun, evil mojo can be lazy at times and i doubt they know what the word balance means but that's easy to look pass  when you're busy enjoying the game"
11284,this game sucks 9/10
11285,Paladins is honestly an amazing game that is heavily oveshadowed by all the other big games out there especally overwatch which is basically a downgraded version of this game and costy in fact if i had come across paladins 1st i never wouldve even gotten overwatch
11286,if you have 15 dollars do yourself a favor and buy overwatch instead
11287,IT  GOOD
11288,"all the (good) characters are locked behind a paywall, progression is very slow/ it takes a very long time to get 1 character. it feels very unbalanced. characters are either op asf or shit. I also dislike how meave and skye gets all the new skins (bp or chests) and characters like seris either never have skins or are super hard to get/exclusive."
11289,9/10

11293,"THIS GAME IS GARBAGE. IF you want the developers to push out by implementing a series of cleverly hidden glitch and exploits then by all means play this game. it is mechanically  crap. most of the charaters are bland. its poorly designed gameplay is a nightmare to deal with, the endless glitches and reward scheudle background manipulation designed to manipulate you dopamine response by cheating for you and against you to create an phycoloical trap designed to drain you pocket book. you better of playing something else.

CANT EVEN LOG IN TO THIER WEBSITE WITH STEAM.
you expect me to believe you cant. the answer is that you wont
you are being a bunch of homo's"
11294,Fun and easy to play and learn. Cool champions and abilities.
11295,"
"
11296,"Before i say anything else, disclaimer, im a firm believer that the way you monetize your game is as much part of the game as is gameplay or aesthetics. If you dont think so and you want to disregard this review because of it, be my guess.

What can i say about this game, thatll not trigger at least some of the people playing it, who for some reason still cares about steam reviews? probably nothing. Its pretty much a game that does a lot of things other games do, but masters none of it. 
Gameplay is your typical hero shooter with the emphasis on teamwork and Overwatch style 5v5 pvp consisting of all your favourite roles. Champions, or Heroes, whatever you want to call them, are all about quantity over quality compared to other similar games, having a lot more of them but having half the dedication and quality of a character from OW for example.
Regular game modes consists of onslaught, witch is a King Of The Hill type of mode with a point that the teams need to hold to get points, Team deathmatch, witch is a total waste of time and Siege, witch is a mix between Onslaught and Payload (pls bring normal payload back).

Business model and monetization, the thing everyone wants to complain about but no ones wants to hear others to do so.
Main source of in game purchases, that the game has are in both character customization and in buying Champions, so that you can use them whenever you want without having to rely on the character rotation, thats taken straight out of League Of Legends. 
If youre the type of person, who loves to have their character look apart, but don't want to blow money on a game like this, i recommend not to get too into it as even getting the basic skins (that are usually very underwhelming) are a big grind away to access.
Most good looking skins and other types of customization are locked as being either limited or exclusive, making them unable to be obtained, unless during very special limited times and i have a feeling, that i talk on behalf of most people, when i say that i will not wait for the devs to finally put the skin i want into a box so that i can spend money on maybe getting it, i will go play games that actually let me get the stuff i want.

In conclusion, if you want to just play a free2play overwatch/league inspiration and don't mind the grind or the lackluster gameplay, or even dont have money and want to spend few hours messing in a free2play game, more power to you. But if you want a serious team shooter experience or have an impulsive personality towards micro transactions like this, i don't recommend as there are many better alternatives out there, even if it means spending some money up front.

11314,NICE
11315,saati... that is all
11316,"Alright, so lets start off with this.

Clearly, I haven't played the game too long, but I'll give my honest opinion on it. Which is, it isn't necessarily bad, but is made bad by some stupid designs and horrible matchmaking.

So, I'll start off with the matchmaking. It is so clearly random. I've just started playing the game and as soon as I'm out of the training lobbies I'm immediately matched against people who have been playing the game for 500ish hours. Literally the meaning of unfair matchmaking.

Second is champion design. Some of them are really cool and unique, others are just straight up stupid and broken. The health-damage scale doesn't help either and some champions feel straight up broken. All in all, would love to play the game, but it's broken,  honestly it reminds me of League of Legends' horrible balance."

If me and my friend were to play healer and tank, we would get garbage dps. If we play healer/dps, the other dps and tank are terrible. If we both play dps we can't find any healer or tank to do their jobs............. If you don't have atleast 3+ people in your group that you know how to play with, don't bother playing because it's not worth it."

11334,its ok but whit friends its even better
11335,bread
11336,pain
11337,If Overwatch was good but made by lazy devs but also somehow better devs? Idk I like the tree dude though
11338,"It's not terrible but there're way to many ""CoD"" champs. Basically the game is riddled  with characters whose sole meta is shooting people. They don't require any thought or serve any niche role, they just wander about the map and shoot people. These characters are easy to beat but they're boring to play against. One chick just shoots people and she also has a shield, ohhhhohohohohoho crazy right? These characters add nothing to the game and I roll my eyes every time they get picked. However, this also represents what I like about the game. There is a decent level of variety in the roster and I never feel like I need to play a certain character. Everyone is fun in their own way and even if I don't like them personally I like knowing I have that option.  

The game does have some balance issues. Healing can sometimes be irritating as some characters don't have the damage potential to outdo it. Stuff like this forces you to build a character into a specific way. The whole point of giving the player the ability to build a playstyle is to give them control and to add depth to the game. This is lost when you need to buy the same item every game just to be effective.

Ultimately this is a casual overwatch. Faster paced with a bigger focus on killing shit. Maps are smaller, at least they feel small. I've seen complaints about unlocking champs but I've only got like 20 hours in so far and have managed to unlock about 7 champs so I have no clue why they're pissed.

The micro-transactions are unobtrusive but dated. For some reason they still use the idiotic seasonal stores. If I want a skin I should just be able to buy it, no one is gonna be like ""oh I can only get this skin during christian Hanukkah? I better play until then"". Let the whales buy their skins. 

It's free so definitely give it ago."
11339,"Fun game. Constantly updated. Decent cartoonish graphics. Very well optimised (i could run max graphics in 1080p with stable 60fps even streaming).

But, the game is poorly balanced... Actually ""#balance"" is unknown term in there... Some characters are still broken as they always been, and worse characters are still... well.. worse. Making the game more frustrating than enjoyable experience, if your favourite character is most likely Tier-Trash.

Didn't play Overwatch, and probably won't. Because im not gonna support controversional developers/publishers, but Overwatch is most likely better balanced game gameplay wise. 

PS: Honestly i would love to give neutral rating, but there's either Yes/No in terms of recommendation on steam."
11340,"Bonne chance les amis!

This game was too complicated for me, but some people seem to like it so I hope they have fun!"
11341,just sweaty people farming the broken game design
11342,no
11343,I like Paladins and the Champions are very interesting but the biggest problem with the game is that people either just don't know how to play or never bother to learn which results in a crap ton of salt and just pure hate for the player base. People do not listen to call outs 95% of the time and don't bother to work together in a >>>TEAM GAME<<<. If it wasn't clear on why the game is losing players then that should shed some light on the matter. Most of the player base is just brain dead.

So I don't know. If they fix the balance issues I will be happy to play it. Until now... it's stupid"
11364,"have you ever played Overwatch before?

it's like Overwatch Co-op vs. AI. 

if Overwatch was CS:GO, Paladins is Valorant. 

tbh both games are kinda doomed now. unfortunate"

Has the same gameplay as Overwatch and Team Fortress 2 with more variety of characters as each one is unique with what abilities and play styles they have. Game is completely free and is possible to unlock every single champion and an alternate costume for them for free as well. Absolutely love this game, but I wish the developers focused on the larger problems like the glitches, and bugs. Especially the audio bug (at the time I am writing this review.)"

The game has certainly become more fun and enjoyable. Sure, the bots are annoying sometimes but overall a pretty good game. Cant wait to see how this game further unfolds. 2 thumbs up. :D 

I think the bot issue will be overcome as more people play the game."

11408,This game is dogshit.
11409,"Paladins is a team-based fantasy shooter in which you fight against your opponents in the style of a multiplayer online arena - for free!

Many are of the opinion that Paladins is just ""poor man's Overwatch"", but while playing the action-packed moba shooter I realized that this view has no substance. The style and skills of the champions can easily be chosen and adapted by the different maps, which makes the champion equipped for every imaginable game situation. You can play Paladins super alone but of course also with your friends thanks to crossplay, which made it even more fun for me. Exciting matches and funny situations are on the agenda and make the time you spend in the game entertaining and really draw you in. 

Due to the fact that it is free, there is no reason not to give the game a chance. Try it out and believe me - you will love it.

11423,"Buggy mess. Couldn't quit out of notifications, they just repeated themselves, sound stopped working after a while."
11424,takes way to long to get new champs W/O p2w
11425,"It's basically overwatch except:

Movement displacement abilities - in overwatch every 2nd hero has a bump or a boop to mess up your aim, sometimes multiple boops from one source in under a second, paladins has so few of them I think it's maybe under 5?
Smurfing doesn't work / isnt attractive - your first few games shoot you up so quickly in elo that you're about where you need to be after around 10-20 games, also you have to buy heros with gold so losing your progress sucks and makes smurfing undesirable to do in the first place.
Supports are just DPS who can heal - they throw out their heal abilities in a nano second and go back to dps, you don't need to sit there focusing on the job of healing 100% of the time.
You can mitigate CC - you hate CC? just buy an item that reduces its effectiveness, YAY have fun in the game again
There's no bullshit situations where you just lose your ultimate - if your ultimate doesn't get all the way out you keep the cooldown
Information - there's so much more information/statistics/analytics available on matches compared to overwatch
Stale 2/2/2 meta - Paladins lets you have the freedom to make any team comp you want unlike overwatch
There's more than one way to play a champion - In overwatch you pick you hero and thats it, there's nothing further to think about, its braindead. Paladins gives you options, there are so many avenues to refine your build or match a heroes kit to your playstyle."

The skins in this game are amazing and they have so much detail put into them, almost as much detail as the brand new league of legends skins, (minus the epic trailers for showing off news sets of skins of course)."

big like"
11449,"Been playing this since open beta on different accounts and on console (around 200+ hours altogether). Despite having quite a few negatives, I still LOVE the game nonetheless. Here are some thoughts:

Positives:
- SERIS (top waifu)
- Great variety of champions. This is what makes it way better than Overwatch and other games in the genre. There's one for everyone. Hi-Rez makes them really well too and they haven't stopped releasing new ones since the beginning.
- Combat mechanics, abilities and ults are all very nicely done.
- This game has the leggiest female champions in all team based games I swear to god lmao
- Quite addicting (which means they do a lot of things right).

Negatives:
- The lore is ONE HOT MESS. No one knows what the fuck is going on anymore. Take it from me who's been there since the beginning lol.
- Matchmaking is a bitch. Say you're on a roll for 6 games, being matched with equally skilled and level players then next thing you know you're on a red wall because you keep being paired with players who barely know how their champions work and then the enemy team has 2-3 lvl 100+ champions. Pretty unbalanced. If I did a push up every time I had to carry in Siege I'd be The Rock right now.  
- Queuing for ranked takes you at least more than 30 minutes. IT SUCKS
- Lack of game modes. It's the same shit for years now. TDM, Siege and Onslaught.
- Graphics aren't bad but it hasn't improved since open beta. A little upgrade would be nice.
- UI kinda sucks imo. They also took out player of the match."

11459,"Good game. I have over 300 hours total, but being f2p has typical bs. Want a new character without grinding? 10$ each ( theirs like 30 characters) . Want a cool skin? 10$ for the chest roll for a 1% chance at a good skin. Want a faster way for credits or in game currency ? Battle pass has you covered.  Just charge us 60 for the game and get rid of micro transactions . Using the same new character / already unlocked ones game after game gets boring by the time you finally grind the time to afford a new one with credits. So cant really recommend unless you dont mind dumping over 500$ into a repetitive overwatch clone, or like 3000 f2p hours + for all the characters.  skins not included, those are 100% p2 unlock only except boring single color ones that dont really make a difference in appearance"
11460,////
11461,Very fun not alot of gamemodes to play but id suggest mostly to play with friends even alone is fun alot of different players to play with definetly has its fun for a while
11462,"good if you dont value your life.
10/10"
11463,"Addictive, casual, fun, deep.
This game has 50 different champions from 4 different classes. The diversity in champions makes balance not the best, but makes the number of possibilities very high in terms of strategy, and matchups.

quite a few champions also can have multiple viable playstyles, that are each played differently, with completely different loadouts and talents.

The biggest downside is the playerbase is small, so you can get matches with both highly skilled players, and new players. Which is fun for neither."
11464,cool game im way late to the party tho unique take on fps
11465,"Perfect game to play casually for many reasons:

 -No game breaking patches or reworks (LoL style), the game is still played the same as it was when released
 -This game actually still releases new content and is free while OW is not free and we'll need to pay to get OW2
 -a team composition of 1 Tank, 1 Heal, 3 DPS is accepted and means that I am less often forced to play Tank or Heal compared to OW
 -Gameplay of the same character can vary depending on your build (Some support characters can be played as DPS)
 -A lot of people actually play the game like I do (for fun) unlike OW where everyone is so sweaty
 -There are more possibilities to explore the gameplay than OW if you are willing to try out new decks/characters. There are many.
 -Games last approximately 15 mins and are much faster if the game is one-sided
 -Win 50% of the time (Unlike battle royales)
 -Making a comeback in a game is possible and incredibly satisfying
 -The learning curve is great. Easy for starters, one can always improve on details but won't gain a too overwhelming advantage over noobs (okey I'll admit some flank characters require more time than the others)
 -I commend my teammates more often than I report them
 -Female characters are thicc ;)

So yeah I will admit the gunplay is not great but the game is more fun than many FPS I have played. As said above I never really played ranked, so I can't advise for those who are looking for a competitive game. Try yourself and find out! Paladins rocks and so do you for reading this!! [VER]"
11466,good
11467, very gud
11468,"i have about 200+ hours on all platforms and I thought it best to leave a review
-good, high quality, nice community, fun gameplay, fun with friends, good enough graphics

- terrible menu, some shity champions, laggy no matter the ping,"
11469,
11470,i am gonna tell my grand kids this was overwatch 2
11471,"Great game, even without spending money. Always bugged and crashing, though"
11472,"This game is fun to play, however there are some broken characters. 
Atlas is very broken because he can place one way barriers which allow for whole team to be covered while being able to attack full power. Also if Atlas is low HP he can just reset himself to full HP, making him extremely hard to kill unless whole team is targeting him.
Skye can literally attack while invisible with insane DPS!"
11473,I've said it before and I'll say it again...I enjoy this game over Overwatch any day. Just so much better imo.
11474,noice
11475,w
11476,my boner is bonerish
11477,.
11478,i love this game i think it need some work on the glitches and some of the stuff you do is not = to the champions so it is okay for a free game so i would make it a 3/5 stars of the game it could be batter but there is some of the game in the hi-rise are a little batter then this i would say but i like this one for the 5v5 part of it so if they made a nuther game of the same i would like the 5v5 part and the champions more =
11479,"its a knockoff of overwatch, and its free. pretty good"
11480,"Gameplay is like Overwatch and its free. They have TDM, Payload & Capture point. I have almost 1k hour on the game. Usually casual until your teammate try hard to win the match (become verbal). Fun most of the time. I had Payload match lasted almost 30 minute, both team were really good. Felt like a tournament match! 
Good luck to new player, have fun!"
11481,e
11482,"A FPS game where aim and strategy don't matter is what this genre should be called. The only winning factor is what broken characters you choose in combination of other broken characters. Half of the roster is unplayable because the balancing scale does not exist. I used to love playing Evie and Bomb King, but in a world where there's already characters designed as aimbots, supports that make any damage dealt entirely useless, and so many god awfully powerful abilities, seeing this game devolve into nothing more than ""play this stupidly OP champion to win"" is what made me quit this game. Skill doesn't matter at this point, you basically win by playing pre-build rosters of dumb powerful champions."
11483,fun
11484,"pretty fun with friends, not very by yourself"
11485,its annoying against nerds but good game
11486,I dont care if people tell you that this is an overwatch copy. The gameplay and like the way the game is played is similar to that of overawtch. This game every champion has different playstyles but in overwatch everyone has 1 playstyle/role.
11487,"If you are a furry, play this game
If you are a weeb, play this game
If you are an incel, play this game
If you can deal with them, play this game
If you can't, leave the internet"
11488,decent gamey
11489,"Imagine a world where you could play a competitive MOBA-like shooter, focused on team play and objectives, as well as characters with unique skills that set them apart from just being ""tank"" or ""healer"" archetypes. 
Imagine that the year is 2015, and your model is based on Smite. You're a year away from having your concept stolen by Blizzard, the masters of sexual harassment and assault.

Now imagine it being fun. It's crazy, I know - but trust me, this one is actually fun unlike the sexual harassment company's copycat. Now I can hear you screaming at me ""How could this one be fun if Lawsuitwatch isn't!?"" at the top of your lungs - let me explain.

In the lawsuit company's game, once you pick a role you are firmly stuck in that role - if you're a healer, you are a healer. You generally speaking don't have the ability to dunk on a flank player because your bones are hollow and your only offensive tool is to scream for help. Paladins however allows you to actually fight back, with decent effect - even if you're a tank, if you're good you can actually defend yourself from a flanker! There's also more variety here, among both characters and game-modes as well as maps.

The design is charming, the graphics look pretty darn great (though the game shows its age in some areas) but most importantly, there's always new content being made - be it skins, maps or small events, this game continues to deliver even 6 years later. 

Best of all? It's free. As it should be. The shooter MOBA concept (or the MOBA-lite genre in general, if you include Smite, the original third person MOBA-lite shooter/brawler) really is only suited for free-to-play models, rather than freemium games with a 60 dollar pricetag.

If you're sick of supporting the sexual assault company, give this a try. It's free to try and who knows, maybe you'll like it?"
11490,Great game!!!!
11491,It is not like other shooter games which need a ton of aiming skill even in beginner level.It is very forgiving even if you play bad. Though people say it is a rip off of overwatch but it is way different than that. There is no specific style to play a character. You can customize every character to suit your play style. Players are helpful if you ask them for help. The only problem in my opinion is a few bugs.
11492,This game may be full of glitches but I keep coming back to it because overall it is fun. Especially if you use the bugs to your advantage.
11493,Buy skins
11494,gud
11495,"good

11521,It doesn't work for me and a certain few other players. Dunno why. Came back to the game after 1-2 year break and couldn't launch it no matter what. maybe it's Steam's issue cuz it won't even launch when I hit Play. Kinda disappointing but meh.
11522,"Overwatch, but not even close to as toxic. Lex GOAT btw."
11523,It's like Overwatch except it's still fun
11524,"Hi, planning on playing this game?

I have been playing this game for more hours than you can see here on my steam. I play with different launcher and here's my conclusion!

1. BUGS BUGS BUGS BUGS BUGS BUGS BUSGAYGSWUAGIUGS
jeeesus to a point where the bugs affecting the gameplay and costing many losses in ranked games. Soundless enemies, imagine getting killed or flanked by something completely silent. Your $400 gaming headphone can't fix that.

2. if you're from SEA region and is planning to play this game, I hope you can multi-server and play in different servers because SEA is absolutely horrendous. My damage not registering from up close no matter how much I hit an enemy. You are going to lag, like it or not.

3. Monetization is just cash grabbing really. LISTEN TO ME when I tell you not to spend too much in this game. Buy your battle pass, don't un-crate any chest. No one will tell you this but whatever skin you get in that chest won't be cool anymore after you use it for more than 6 times.

4. Don't take this game seriously. The stupid mechanic and abilities they gave the characters can make a fight one sided, the matchmaking is boogers.

Hope this helps."
11525,very stupid game but very fun

11530,A lot like overwatch but i shit on ppl instead
11531,"Whats up all! Its your boy PhriskoDaGod! Shouts to the OG PS4 community members for Paladins! Yea, i put my big boy shoes on and got a gaming PC lol! RIP Vengeance_7x on PS4. We miss you everyday.

So, I've been playing this game since Closed Alpha on PS4 and for the last 2 to 3 years on PC with a controller (yes with a controller lol) and i have been through all the ups and downs. I love playing this game and i can never see myself ever stopping! Here's why!

Its free, constantly getting new updates and new champions and is very community focused when it comes to the development of the game since the beginning. Its an easy game to pick up and a tough to master. 

As a new player, you need to understand that this game is all about learning roles along with learning the ins and outs of each champions kit. Rule of thumb is that you want to learn at least 2 roles with 3 champions in each role. Most new players jump into playing as a Damage or Flank champion so do yourself a favor and try to learn Frontline and Support first. At lower levels, its hard to find good tanks and supports because people just wanna shoot things without understanding that this game has MOBA elements. Learning to fill any role is the best choice, but focus 2 first.

You'll be playing against bots until you hit level 5 so don't go thinking you're amazing at the game and everyone is bad lol. Familiarize yourself with a few champs and save your gold to buy meta champs if you plan on going into ranked. if not, buy whatever champs you want really lol. But you might find yourself getting into the game and being upset at yourself for buying a champ because she had big boobs or hes just so handsome. To be, or not to be a Simp. Thats your call lol

The game also has a bit of lore for those that are into that. I'm not. Quite frankly i never gave a crap about lore lol. Its a fps to me at the end of the day. I enjoy applying the fps and Moba skills and kicking butt!

One of the major drawbacks to this game is how buggy it has always been! Its not as bad as it was in the beginning but its a free game by a company that pales in financial resource compared to the likes of Blizzard or Activision. For the bit of bugs it suffers from over the years, it remains a fun game worthy of you time and effort if it brings you joy to play!

Also, this community can be toxic in Ranked so, don't rush getting into ranked. Have fun and learn the game, learn your roles and if you think you can contribute to the ranked community, go for it! but you have been warned about the toxic environment it may be at times. Working as a team and playing your roles and champion well eliminates that. Go into ranked without knowing your roles or champions will get you in a lot of drama. Don't be that guy that last picks a champ we didn't need."
11532,ive played for 500+ hours so dont play if ur under 14 or ill smack u
11533,"I really wanted to like this game. It's clearly ripping off Overwatch, which is actually a great idea considering it's popularity. However, the art style feels like the Wish.com variant of OW, the game play is stiff and unintuitive. Paladin's fast pace is fun but can be confusing, even for seasoned MOBA/FPS players and some heroes can feel way more easy to manipulate than others. The card system, purchasing items, and locking of characters really take away from the experience as a whole."

*you can buy coins for champions"
11548,"This is a game that is not very well known due to the popularity of Overwatch, but it should be. It had such a wide variety of champions to play as and each has their own unique sets of abilities and skins. Also, the skill card and item buying system makes the gameplay a lot more interesting. If you like hero shooter games, you should play Paladins. Besides, it is free."
11549,Surprisingly fun gameplay.  Takes the interesting aspects from MOBAs while being actually a fun to play competitive fps.

11559,"This game has been installed on my PC forever it seems, and I have really enjoyed it. I still do, honestly, playing it from time to time. But for the last YEAR it crashes every time you select a character. Its a real shame they cant fix this big of an issue. Have no intentions of playing anymore, but hey, its free."

11568,It's not bad for a free game. It's much more fun with friends since playing solo can be discouraging unless you're luckily always playing with randoms that understand the game. It can take a while to find a champion you actually like but it's so much more fun when you find a character you enjoy.
11569,the try hards are sad sad people
11570,"The game is really unbalanced, match making is bad, the graphics settings are messed up, characters are too expensive, FPS in this game is all over the place and mostly everything is bought with real money but the game isn't P2W. The best description for this game is ''a poor man's Overwatch.'' but it is fun when you play with 3 people and the characters are all unique on their own way."

11581,"hi-rez fucked this one up bad

Their newest fuck up is their push for adding more furry anthro skins ONLY because the community complained about one that already existed in the game. If you don't like that, giga-brained defenders of this move will call you a bigot. I guess this was lost somewhere in translation so I'll spell it out: fetishizing animals is fucking disgusting and adding a new furry skin because you got negative feedback from the already existing one is just petty."
11582,"I was looking at overwatch and was wondering ""what could be a good free game like this"" as i had no money and i looked this up and the game is amazing. I love the way how every character is balanced by having lots of buffs and flaws and how every character has their own abilities but not too overpowered. It's a little bit like overwatch but is free and has different characters. Be sure to check this out if you don't like overwatch or just want a brake. Or have no money like me."

Developer keeps releasing new patches and new characters but refuse to correct basic features of the game like:
1) Androxus is a forever broken character. way too op
2) Some maps have bug exploit locations if you are using high mobility characters like Maeve, Ruckus, or Androxus.
3) Game is insanely buggy, to the point that sometimes it's unplayabe
Some problems are not related to the developers but the community, since the game is free to play there's really no punishments for toxic players, and mind you there's plenty for a free game."

if your a team player"
11600,"Such a good game. On first glance it looks like a Overwatch copy but its more than that. The talents and cards force you to adapt to the enemies play style as every player can have different builds on the same character. The game feels very fast paced and will take time to get comfortable with the fast pace of the game. And lastly the community is mostly friendly, yes there are some bad apples on the batch but the majority are friendly."

11603,"A mix of League of Legends and Fortnite. It reminds me a bit of Valorant. I can't say It's a bad game, but I can't say I love it so much. Maybe It's because of other games. If there were no games like Lol and Valo, I think I would have played this a lot. If you are bored or don't like games like Valo and Lol, I think you can give this game a chance."

(great game for on the go and plays good on the switch.) Also one of the only games with a lot of playable characters that i actually enjoy playing as any/all of them. I don't like half of them on Overwatch and it has half the roster. Good to play casual or ranked. Ranked play is taken pretty seriously. Big thumbs up from me and highly recommended."
11612,fun game

11614,fun.
11615,nice
11616,Better than overwatch
11617,"You know how some games are seasonal, and people only love them during their hyped days but those kinds of games will eventually die out sooner or later? well this game isn't like that, in a good way"
11618,good soup
11619,"This game is a pretty cool hero shooter. It'll provide a fun time for anyone looking for a f2p Overwatch substitute, but even on its own this game is still great. There are lots of heroes to play around with and have fun. You get to personalize your playstyle with loadouts that you can make with cards. These loadouts will augment the characters abilities according to how string you want them. The game also has a lot of f2p bullshit, and its kinda buggy, and it's not that well balanced. However, those are only going to be problems if you take it seriously. As much as I enjoy playing this game, I can't blindly defend some of the problems with this game, but I do ask that if you can overlook these issues then Paladins can be a lot of fun.

Pros:
 - As I've already said there is a lot of fun to be had with this game. A lot of the characters can be really fun to play with and even characters that I've found annoying to play, can still be satisfying to use against noobs and people who don't understand how to fight against those characters.
 - There are fun costumes and stuff to play and use that, in my exp, made my mains stand out more and fit their personalities very well. You ofc get sprays and emotes, that can also be satisfying to taunt people with. 
 - The gameplay: I mostly get into siege games. I rarely get to play other game modes, which is kind of a shame because the other game modes can be really fun. Except for Team Deathmatch (its so dumb). But I'm not upset about that because siege games are still fun, unless you get incompetent team mates. I can't really talk to much about what this game's competitive scene and the meta are like since I mostly play casually, but I have spent over 400 hours in total playing this game (played it on my switch) so I think that counts for something.

Stuff thats ok:
 - The visuals are neat, but kinda like the art style a bit.
 - The music is fine.
 - The characters, story, and lore is also fine. Maybe a bit generic for some people.

Cons:
 - As I already said, the only problems is just the fact that the game has all the f2p bullshit (no p2w stuff right now). MTX, Lootboxes, it also has a Battle Pass and other things you can purchase. It's a fucking buffet of greedy bullshit. If I had one recommendation, I would say to not take the game seriously. Its fun to play, but don't feel like you have to buy stuff to look cool online. If you pull off a cool play, people [b] will [/b] notice you.
 - And also its a bit buggy sometimes. I've not encountered anything gamebreaking while playing, but some other people have.

TLDR: The game's fun. I recommend it. Don't take the game too seriously, just play it to have fun and its free so there's no reason to not try it out, unless you want to avoid the f2p stuff."

It's (mostly) fair, quite fast and has huge variety with both champions and loadouts for those champions I highly suggest giving it a try and if you don't like it, well it didn't cost you any money."

Worth it, if you enjoy MOBA."
11660,"This game is a f2p Overwatch just without any of the charm that Overwatch has. There really isn't any redeeming qualities to Paladins other than the fact that everyone on it has no idea how to use a mouse or keyboard let alone a computer. In other words, you win a lot."

except for the monetisation, but its a f2p game so what do you expect"

11676,"In my opinion Paladins is a great game that struggles because of situation that Hi-rez and Evil Mojo are in with multiple games that are actually dead. Paladins also struggles from the fact that people write it off as an Overwatch clone, which it's not, not realizing that so many parts of Overwatch are not original. To sum it up a great game tarnished by the situation that the devs are in and people who write it off without playing it"

11711,"[strike]It's an okay game. You might think I'm a new player because of how many hours I have on this game (48 hours) but no. This is only an alt account. I forgot my old steam account's password so...

Anyways, the game is still fun for me, but the new changes are what's making me think is bad. But eh good game[/strike]

Paladins is a very fun game! It's main mode is Siege. Both teams (enemy team and your team) will have to go to a point to capture the point. And you will then have to push a payload after capturing the objective. If you are successful to push the payload you win the round :ehe~2: 

Paladins is a fun game, its characters are very fun, ranging from different species such as demons (Abyssians), angels (Pyreians), Gods, Goddesses. It's lore is so deep too! The Paladins lore that is! It's very interesting to me, and that's the reason why I love playing Paladins!"
11712,Played paladins on PC and on Switch for a total of 100+ hours. I can swing around like spiderman AND kill enemies. also theres a gremlin cat girl. most characters can be unlocked via playing the game too so thats fun. 8/10 would recommend if ur sick of dying in other fps
11713,One of the best free games ever. This game is nice and fun specially if you like Overwatch its very similar.

11722,"this game can act like a free version of Overwatch but i'm not gonna be comparing the two games every one of them have they're ups and downs but paladins in my opinion has bad matchmaking system they're more focused on the cosmetics/skins
SUMMARY:if you can't afford Overwatch this is the best second option if you can't run it go with TF2 other than that I rate this game 7.5/10 they still need improvement."
11723,"It's pretty good, like if the Overwatch devs didn't hate their playerbase."

11743,Great Game to Chill with Friends
11744,"I was playing non-stop since I downloaded it.  Yep.  Was great until I started getting people just afking in matches with no way to report them.  This has been an issue since the game launched and nothing has been done by the devs, so, I simply started ditching matches.

Waste of my time especially with how long progression takes for characters.

I've gotten to the point where I'm going to move on to another game.

I'm out."
11745,I love it and hope to support it for the years to come.
11746,Great game
11747,great game similar to overwatch but since its free to play i thinks its kinda better plus the heroes are cool

11754,"At one point, this was the most balanced team based game I had ever played. This is no longer the case unfortunately. Were it not free I wouldn't recommend it but it is so give it a shot, just keep in mind that it's not nearly as balanced as it used to be"
11755,"Uses EpicOnlineServices

A ""developer kit"" that farms your data without informing you. Nice"

11759,Everything I wanted with Overwatch that Overwatch never delivered.
11760,"Used to be a good game though now the servers are garbage, game is filled with bugs, more features are removed than added overtime and the character balance is shit.

Hirez is desperate to monetize the game to make it viable so they can go have a rainbow pride parade near their neighbourhood park. (game is filled with pointless LGBT propaganda).

Update: Server after new patch still run by hamsters."

They got rid of play of the game because it was ""causing issues"", the game crashes frequently and I have a very good computer that runs Overwatch on Ultra graphics with no problems at all whatsoever. Paladins is the only game I own that crashes randomly and after lots of research, the game crashing is not uncommon. Fun game to play, just wish they would fix the multiple technical issues the game has."
11779,Fonny tortle in game
11780,free to play overwatch
11781,Everything is balanced because every champion is broken.  :D
11782,137hrs logged in this game so to keep it simple it’s fun. Better alternative to Overwatch if that community is not your cup of tea. Although in-game purchases are available it’s not necessary. But who doesn’t like character and weapon skins while slaying out right!?
11783,This is my favorite game ever :)

11795,Dont
11796,"Champions have unique play styles. There is a huge variety of modes and lineups so there's always something different to try. The item/card system is what makes this game for me, you can build the same champion so many different ways.

There are rare server stability issues."
11797,"A very nice free to play alternative to Overwatch. Whereas Overwatch went in the gameplay balance direction of ""Tanks for days"" Paladins went in the direction of ""Everyone does damage"". The different Talents and Card builds you can choose for characters also add some nice mix up into gameplay."

11806,Meh.
11807,"For a free FPS game it's alright. I regret buying OW, much more now in light of Blizzard's lack of ethics/common sense. That isn't to say this game tenderly cared for by Hi-Rez. Cheaters exist + some champions aren't balanced all that well. There's not enough people playing, so matchmaking can get wonky sometimes. Game also has some issues with plugging in joysticks. Not to mention the bugs and crashes. Love/hate relationship kinda comparable to TF2, though it might not be as good, since there's still WAY more people on TF2. Overall, I'd recommend giving it a try. shooty gun and big red number pop up but also free wow"
11808,Overwatch without the sex offenders
11809,"The game is filled with bugs. The makoa hook boggles out and whenever you try to play the game on SEA servers it keeps disconnecting you. All you had to do was to make the game smoother since it has everything copied and shitty graphics. DO NOT PLAY THIS FUCKING GAME.

11813,It's pretty good. Not gonna lie!
11814,Look this could be a good game but there is so many unbalanced champions so many with absolutly overpowered abliities that if you have to face you might as well kiss your ass good bye because there is no way your going to kill them. These game devs need to fix there shit.
11815,"DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME... IT's dying, less than 20k players. TONS of smurfs so you will never progress. Bugs out the @ss. Devs only care about the money."

11818,"Stupid game full of bugs and crashes. And no, it's not because of my system or my drivers. People who made this game are idiots, that's all that is to it. It's blessing if the game decides to run and actually let me join a match and have all the buttons in the GUI available. Not to mention, if you have a joystick plugged in - you're screwed! There's no fcking way to disable it and the idiotic game keeps thinking you are using an XBOX controller, just because. Honestly, do yourselves a favour and don't buy this trash. Developers are way too busy coming up with skins and other BS that nobody cares about instead of actually improving the game. Total joke!"
11819,i love this game its really fun and its worth the money that u spend
11820,"---- ⭐⭐Would Recommend 85/100 ⭐⭐ ----

- Great Champion Variation

- Easy to jump in to and get started.

- Easy to find matches

- Skill curve is standard for a competitive based game like this. 

- Some skins can be pricey but for a free game its your choice and a great way to support a free title. 

Notes : Would recommend to FPS and fantasy players, great variation and have another similar game *Realm Royale*"
11821,"This game is great if you're looking for one of the best free to play fps games. The gameplay is great, characters are diverse, and it's extremely beginner friendly."

11828,Account management for this game is a joke. You might have an existing account and already linked it with steam yet you cant enter your account. Whats that you thought fuck it i will take another nick and go playing. Naah you cant do that either. Then you wanna send a support ticket to dumb-rez studios shitsupport services which probably would take less time if it was sent with postal service. But you have an auto sent respond e mail which wont gonna help you either but telling you to go fuck yourself. I wanna to end my article with saying thank you if you read this far and dont play this game.

11837,"4 out of 5 Stars.
Simple time killer. 
I wouldn't suggest getting competitive playing it, as the champion balance is the end all mechanic in this game. 
#RockPaperBroken"
11838,"Honestly, does this game have some flaws? Yes, I can't think of a free game that doesn't have some sort of flaws (minor glitches, balanced champ problems, graphical errors). However, overall I believe this game is great. I played it in Beta and have come back to play every once in a while over the years and can wholeheartedly say that I haven't had any bad experiences. For the most part, the community is very friendly compared to many other 5v5 games. I like the balance updates that the game provides and the new characters that get released over time. I recommend this to people of any age as well."

11860,"after playing for 40 hours and playing overwatch and splitgate I can say that this game is not at its best state. altough I play well and have my 3 champions the game itself has fundamental problems with netcoding, hitboxes, and hit detection. unbalancing between the heroes and a toxic community does not help. The game is losing population by the week last time I played it had an average of 30k players one year later it has average of 10k players. this game has also  alot of lootboxes. If u want a good shooter of this genre play team fortress 2 or overwatch don't bother with this game it wil be fun for a couple of hours but then u wil start to see the downsides."

11875,"if you dont feel like spending money on overwatch, this is the best option"
11876,"I've spent hundreds of hours on this game between Playstation and Steam. A lot of people, myself included, have called this the Overwatch clone. In a way, it is, but I also think in some ways it's better. It's free, so that's already a plus. From a morale stand-point Hi-Rez has a better reputation if that's something you consider when playing a game. The community is not quite as toxic or competitive at least in ways like bashing you over voice chat or text. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, PvP games bring out the best, and worst, in everyone. Hi-Rez does a lot of interacting with the community through Discord and Twitch, and that's something I appreciate.

One of the most unique features, one that separates it from Overwatch and improves upon the formula is the cards. You can create your own style of fighter based on your cards and their allocated points. It adds a layer of customization and also generates so many varieties of the heroes, really allowing you to make it just how you want.

For me this game is always going to have a special place because it brought my friends and I together a lot. We'd group up, sometimes having a whole team, and just spend the whole night playing. A lot of laughs and good memories were made playing this.

It's a game that I'm always going to have in my library, even if I don't play it as often these days. When I get the itch to play a pure PvP game this is the one I queue up."

in rank almost in every game if my team or the other team is gonna lose they just do a ""ddos"" attack on the server so it crashed the game and just don't lose or win the game.
no matter what you do to report a cheater he will just keep cheating with no bans what so ever.
the game is just unplayable 

Unbalanced Champ's
lack of content (Events,Maps)
Anti cheat ? even tho they using EasyAntiCheat they still don't even care about banning anyone.

11903,"Tons of bugs, disconnecting during matches making it hard to play in a group, though it's still far worse to play solo. Typical in game culture that's rather negative and mean-spirited, can't honestly say I have fun more often than not. Heavy pushing of microtransactions to the detriment of functionality, and a lot of artificial complexity in terms of loadouts giving the illusion of customization that will routinely get rebalanced, so your two options are either sink hundreds of hours into repeatedly becoming competent at a free to play game that could at any moment change/be shut down, or just follow recommended buildouts and lobotomize any involvement you have in the game beyond following instructions.

All in all, I would just recommend playing a different game if you have an option that your other friends are willing to play."
11904,The game is interesting and fun!
11905,it's a fun to play game
11906,It's like Overwatch but made by a company that isn't literal garbage and actually knows how to balance a game.

11910,"Great champion designs, both artistic and mechanically sound for the most part Took a great style of game play and made it their own. Could use some work on the match making,it is kind of lame getting matched up with Bronze players while Im struggling to work my way through Gold,and I am sure higher lv players want nothing to do with me the same way! My main gripe is the constant influx of content,it is great stuff but I wish they would fine tune the current game! Either way it is a fun game,active Devs and community keep it fresh. I played a lot on xbox when it first came out,glad to be able to enjoy it on Steam as well!"

11931,Fun
11932,Wish that King of the Hill and Onslaught were two game modes instead of one.
11933,"Just came over to play this after Overwatch has lost all fun.  What a complete waste of my time.  What kind of game matchmaking literally puts you against people who are pros compared to you RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE???  Why would I even want to waste my game time getting stomped every game?  It's pointless to even try getting into this game because as a brand new player you are against teams of people with 20 whatever mastery levels on heroes.  Absolute garbage, and for that experience they want money?????  LOL I don't think so.  If you didn't start playing the game years ago, just don't even bother.  These developers don't know how to make a game everyone can play, just the people that were around when it started.  Trash.

On top of that, the heroes you play in the game have no balance at all, and you can't switch to counter anything in the game.  So once the seasoned players and people who obviously play the game 8 hours a day lock in the OP hero picks, you are screwed and have already lost the game.
Most of the games I played were just stomps against enemies you can't can't and give you like a two shot death.  No counters, no balance, OP characters that only the longtime players know to pick so they'll never lose.
No wonder this game is free to play.  Seriously nobody would pay for this."
11934,This game is good for someone want to play valorant but their pc system cant play it
11935,good
11936,Been playing for 3 years now it's a very fun community based team shooter. Plenty of cool characters and a deep story lore. You'll have a great time in the realm. :)
11937,I enjoy this so far some of the characters can be a little broken when paired correctly but really looking forward to start playing ranked just waiting on a couple friends to gain access to the ranked playlist
11938,id say its an 3 star game couse its kinda fun but its basicly copyed overwatch so.....

> Aim

> skill timing
> items
> hero experience"
11942,"Just gonna keep it simple :)

- Basically Overwatch but more content (maybe not skins) and RPG elements through loadouts/talents/in-game store
- Free sooo... just download it and try it?
- Game has been through a lot of rough stages and highlights through the years but it is now fairly consistent in quality/gameplay
- Gameplay is good w/ lots of champions, customizable loadouts, and map variety
- Combat is good but hitboxes are large and misleading, especially during fast movements (dashes, teleports, etc)
- Balance is more consistent now with few to no outliers. However, ranked meta evolves every update (every 2 months) and usually isn't too stale.
- Matchmaking is very inconsistent depending on individual performance and how many people are playing at that time. Sometimes I get amazing matches that last 30 minutes and then other times it ends faster than the queue time :)
- Queue time can be fast (0-2 mins) but when it's late, it can become closer to 3-5 mins)
- Servers can randomly turn to dogshit but sometimes it's good connection

Overall a good game that you can just sit back and play to relax.
Tip: Watch streamers and youtube to get tips"
11943,Great game
11944,"Somehow atrociously buggy nearly 3 years after beta, unfinished assets that have yet to be updated, and game-breaking issues so bad that you need to reinstall for some of them. And yet they found the time to add a cornucopia of different ways to blow your cash, such as a battle pass and crossover cosmetic events. 

This game is not worth your time as a new player. Find a better game with better devs, better balance, and at least somewhat decent quality assurance."

11965,Its okay
11966,"this game is fun like valorant but i think this game is way more fun
"
11967,"I have to recommend this game however it was a tough decision.

I have played this game since beta and I have seen the rise and fall of this game. The team behind it continues to go in negative directions while neglecting community feedback. The ranked mode is highly toxic and wont let you party up with your friends when you hit a certain level making it impossible to make sure you have a good team. I can hardly remember a single game where all members of my team worked together and made the game fun. Most things Paladins release is broken or unfinished which can lead to lengthy times to fix, the refer a friends page has been broken for who knows how long. If Paladins cared about their community, they wouldn't have to shut down their competitive gaming scene.

On the positives, the game can be really fun when you get a good team and has a lot of different characters that can fit anyone's play style.

I recommend giving it a shot and wish you luck because this game is either really fun, or FUCKING SUCKS. it depends on the match"

11999,"I do give a recommendation, but with a huge caveat. These kind of games (TF2, Overwatch and the like) often suffer from an overly casual player base with less than stellar teamwork skills (heck, less than stellar skills in general). 

If you intend to really play the game and not just tag along with a bunch of toddlers trying to figure out which way is forward, then i suggest you try to get a few friends together and play as a team, as you won't have much luck with the random matchmaking Paladins offers.

The graphics are serviceable, the heroes offer a good variety in abilites and can be fun to play (I play healers and tanks mostly) when given the chance (i.e. when the team doesn't suffer from wanna-be dps heroes that REALLY should have their eyes checked, and REALLY REALLY actually shouldn't play dps).

So, if your nerves can stand up to the above, give Paladins a try, you just might like it. Just make sure you keep a cup of tea ready to keep calm and carry on.

Cheers"

It is crazy unbalanced, it can sometimes be no fun at all, some interfaces are confusing and it is insanely unwelcoming to new players. There's so many times i had various teammates that don't buy any items because the tutorial never tells you that there is a shop in this game. Not to mention that the matchmaking is beyond broken right now.

Give it a shot if you want but i cannot in good faith recommend this game, you're better off with other F2P games."

12091,"I should say this: i have put 300 hours into this game. And I hardly even play online shooters. But I am going to say this: the game is unbelievably buggy. Half the time the client can't even load correctly, most of the time I have to change the resolution every time I turn the game on just to see if it fits. That's not counting the crashes, errors and amazingly toxic gameplay atmosphere you will deal with as you play. There's a great hero shooter in here. Cool ideas, great gameplay - hell, the game looks good when it actually runs. and they continue to support it and add meaningful content frequently. I just wish they could really iron out the rough edges substantially."

There's a large cast of characters to play as, all with their own sets of skills that sets them apart from each other pretty well. One of my favorite aspects of Paladins is the loadout system they have for each character. It's basically a way to further customize the character you play by amplifying certain parts of their ability set to really let you play your favorite character the way YOU want to play it. As far as I've seen, all characters are pretty viable and all in all, pretty great fun with friends or by yourself!"

12144,"[h1] THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE!!! [/h1]

This game is definitely one of the worst games I've ever played. The characters are all messed up, have abilities stolen from Overwatch and mixed with different characters. I personally [b] DO NOT [/b] recommend anyone this game.

Sure, here are more characters than in Overwatch but they are all the same. 80% of the characters have machine guns, 3 sniper characters and the rocket launcher guy originially called in Overwatch Phara is in Paladins a dragon with a bad jetpack that can only fly for 3 seconds and so the character walks mostly on the ground.

All people who write that Overwatch is horrible and Paladins is great are [b] COMPLETELY WRONG [/b]. They simply were bad players in Overwatch who got wrecked every respawn.

I'm learning Python coding and so Overwatch is perfect to me because in Overwatch you can program your own workshop modes and the best are even added to the official game modes.

Here in Paladins this great feature is missing completely and so programmers like me don't find any use playing this game. I hate Paladins!"

Progression toward champions lvl is ok but and a BIG BUT to get a new champion you need Jesus to reborn you into a second life after you are done with this one.The game is not pay to win THANK GOD but you'll see a lot of little children that stole a credit card from their mom and now have nice and sexy skins wOw you just spend a life saving on a game that isn't even worth playing in my opinion.You can get much more fun from playing League of Broken champions OR as low price as Overwatch. Don't play cause you'll get a mental breakdown

12176,"Weirdly funny. Perfect evening game to transfer hate, anger and all other negative energy build up in the whole day to your opponent(Sometimes the opposite happens but its balanced, as everything should be). Not good if you are playing solo, since the number of players is kinda low. Ranked matches are kinda dead(takes more than 10 min to even find one). 

Recommended."
12177,"Very fun game, especially when playing with friends ive put almost a day into this game over the last few days. I dont regret it."

12203,great!
12204,Decent gameplay. Feels like a mobile game the entire time tho
12205,"It's a pretty fun game, but with any game that requires common sense, basic awareness or teamwork, you will never find a teammate who possesses any of those qualities. Every single game will have a leaver, a thrower and someone spamming quick chat commands to the point that you can't hear the game. In competitive, your leader will ban a dps when the enemy team already has two, they will ban every tank before your team even has one, while the enemy has the top meta picks, etc. The game just requires a baseline level of intelligence that the average person apparently lacks."

12220,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."
12221,"Pros: Good gameplay, fun characters, interesting lore, large selection of characters, buying the game unlocks all characters and tons of items, balanced gameplay, tons of customizing your characters, beautiful character design and map design. Gamemodes are super fun and a unique take on classic modes such as payload.

Cons: Clunky UI design, some characters/skins have poor voice acting (but most are good), SO MANY BUGS. Seriously, if it wasn't for the bugs, this game could be crazy popular."

12227,"im going to make alot of overwatch comparisons here because there similar 

paladins oh paladins how great and how disappointing you are, i enjoy this game, loads and on a very very basic level this game is better than overwatch, characters are all different from each other bringing a unique and dynamic feel to every match, maps are pretty decent and theres not a single map that i straight up hate which is rare for me and the card system is amazing, it really feels like each and every point you put into every card changes the character incredibly, paired with the perk system i really think it makes the game come alive you can make a character be and feel like so many different things which has the affect as well of seeing multiple different play-styles on the oppositions side.

now lets talk about where it falls short. the game just doesn't have that overall polish that overwatch seems to have, everything just feels that bit more 'clunker' and doesn't have that smooth linear feel which is what i enjoy form overwatch. skins which are mostly attained through monetary means (this game is free though so ill let it slide) leave something to be desired and dont give that 'wow' factor that some games deliver. i dont like that you have to buy characters and level them up to get certain perks as it kinda restricts the game for newer and more casual players but it isnt the end of the world.i would say i do prefer overwatch but that may just be that im better at it 

overall i would defiantly recommend this game, at least just to try plus its free so you really are not losing anything.
i would pay 20-30 dollars and still be happy with the experience i got."
12228,Pretty sick ngl
12229,The game is very funny and easy to learn but they need to work at bugs fixes.
12230,to many try hards
12231,the grind is real in this game but fun as hell really enjoyed the content of this game since it 1st came out
12232,I literally only play this game because im good at it and raum exists no where else but paladins and my heart.
12233,Is a moba game but in first person
12234,"Imagine if Overwatch was free, and then imagine Overwatch was good, that's Paladins."
12235,fun
12236,"it good

12237,Funny knife cat girl
12238,dont be a virgin. play something else
12239,"game should have better matchmaking half my team has no idea what theyre doing
"
12240,"I started playing Paladins to see if it was worth paying because I heard a lot about the game and I was impressed that it was very good after I stopped playing Overwatch because of the Activision/Blizzard scandal.

However this game has too many players with Aimbots with perfect shots being super far away using characters that have no precision unless they are to close and they were shooting like a sniper. 

And another thing that I saw frequently enemy players using Bots engine and look like the script didn’t work for them and the enemy players stayed in running towards the wall and when you shot them they returned the shot with precision. 

I always play competitive Overwatch all the time and love Paladins, but is sad that an excellent game is full of players with Aimbots and Bots."
12241,Good game
12242,very fun and simple game
12243,"Step into the light, AND PARRISH"
12244,"got banned once like 3 years ago, pretty solid game"
12245,Fun game
12246,game for everyone not for armles people (as a phrase armless)
12247,its better than overwatch i can say that
12248,"I've been playing this game on and off for like 4 or 5 years and I've also been playing Overwatch for around the same amount of time on and off (clocking around 600 hours of match time), those are different games and can't really be compared in my opinion. Paladins used to be a good and somewhat balanced game with its flaws but now everything that made it interesting to play got lost amongst all the negatives.

Awful matchmaking, in itself and due to the fact that no one is playing this game anymore. The ranking system is broken beyond any repair, I've been placed Bronze during almost all of my placement matches yet I end up high Platinum or Diamond after 40-50 games of climbing, meaning the games are completely unbalanced. You get Silver players in Plat/Diamond lobbies, you get fresh accounts in bronze lobbies against Golds/Silvers, you get players with 10 champs unlocked including the free weekly rotation. 4 games out of 5 the outcome is set in stone during draft phase. Also the difference between mouse / keyboard and controller queues is insane, you get Master players with the titles and the frames obtained in easy controller queues that are literally lost when it comes to play with a mouse and keyboard and constantly feed or are unable to aim in Gold games.

Ranked has never been a good experience in Paladins (while not perfect, Overwatch's one is a bit better, but still average). Casual is okay, but here are all the other flaws of the game. The netcode is quite poor, skill shots barely exist, map collisions are buggy af, some techs / ultimates are literally unusable or work once every two moons, the UI is also filled with bugs (win and losses resetting to 0 for no reason then reappearing out of the blue, daily quests not tracking, rank not being displayed, game history with empty charts and such). The reward system is a shell of what it used to be, gold is only used to unlock characters and to buy basic skins, can't get skins even for a lot of in gold money. Skins are to be bought with real money and are in lootboxes so you can't even buy the skin you want. You have to spend some money, open some chests and hope you get the skin you wish. Some of the skins are really good, some of them are totally cringey and aimed at 13-yo anime fans (especially female heroes).

The balance used to be quite good too, with like every game, some overpowered stuff that wasn't that overpowered the higher you'd play. But now, you could strip literally 30 heroes out of the 50 the roster has and you wouldn't see any difference in ranked play. Some supports are literally broken and are mechanically above every other one, some flanks / damage dealers have to be instalocked or banned because you shoot yourself in the foot by not having it in your team. It results in overall boredom because every game feels scripted, you face the same heroes, playing the same talent, and you also know from start if you can win or not, provided the matchmaker does its job and matches you against an equivalent team (which happens rarely).

This game has some qualities : the hero roster (character diversity both in roles and gameplays), the pace (not too fast, not too slow), its easiness to understand (it really has no depth compared to Overwatch), the deck and talent systems allowing for customization and freedom of gameplay, along with enemy team countering. But none of them are good enough any longer to justify investing some time in this game. It's okay for casual intermittent play but that's it. 

TLDR : broken rank system and matchmaking, game is riddled with gameplay, collisions and netcode bugs and is basically a cashgrab unless you're ready to grind for hours or to throw the games because you can't pick a decent hero to counter the enemy team."

12258,just yes
12259,100% love this game
12260,"Gameplay is fun, there are several ways to customize your champion and spec them a certain way compared to other games in the same genre. My only issue is that most cosmetics in the game are locked behind a lootbox system. If they put a flat price on every skin I would be more inclined to purchase crystals to get the skin I want. That being said there are no microtransactions that hinder gameplay other than the $30 for every past and future champions which is not necessary if you have the time to grind out gold and unlock them for free, kind of like R6 Siege."
12261,Good aha
12262,"hello how are you, Im under the water"

12282,"Initially I played Paladins because I was not sure about buying Overwatch, but I kinda got really interested in Paladins and forgotten about Overwatch later on. It has a similar concept but I do love the graphics in Paladins more and the learning it takes to master each role and heroes. Definitely recommended for those who like this type of game :)"
12283,"i love this game however i had a horrible experience with customer service my user id is stuck as a random string of characters because ""KingKush925"" was against TOS or some dumb crap they refuse to help or explain and take weeks between messages ! the game is fun tho so just dont spend money if you think an issue may come up they are worthless as support staff"
12284,THIS A GOOD GAME IT FUN AND IT EASY
12285,"If you want a more interesting and thought out version of Overwatch, I would highly recommend this game.  After playing for four years through rocky and good times the game still has me comng back."
12286,"I honestly don't understand how Paladins less popular than Overwatch being free-to-play. 
Definitely worth your attention if you're into competitive fps."
12287,I recommend  this game if you don't have overwatch or you don't know what to do. :>
12288,probably a dead game and still has a problem on log-in screen. play if you want to enjoy it for a few days/hours.
12289,just crap
12290,Probably the only game I've ever played that got consecutively worse with every update.
12291,"Like overwatch, but free"
12292,"Very nice shooting and tactic game, you also can get fun there!"
12293,Unbalanced.
12294,very  fun to  play.
12295,"Enjoyable,not as much as before when it was beta but still not bad game"
12296,"I know it's free but Overwatch is absolutely better in every possible way, if this is your sort of game. If you can't afford Overwatch, Paladins works well enough. Till the day you play Overwatch, after which you will never come back.

Don't mean to say Overwatch is a perfect game, but it really is head and shoulders above Paladins."

12304,Unpolished and with many flaws but still a decent game
12305,If Overwatch and Magic the Gathering had a baby...
12306,If you like fps team based objective games then I think you will be pleased with this game. The mix of character abilities adds a lot of different possibilities heading into a match so things wont be so boring. You will have to consistently adapt play-style to counter the different abilities of the enemy team. So I hope you enjoy the game. I do also recommend playing with some friends. That always makes it nicer to play any game.
12307,"Yes, unbalanced. But better teams that will usually stick it out with yall and not abandon. Forces you to get better. Fun challenge. Mix of hero's and abilities. Try all champions! Have Fun."

Let's hope there will be some cool updates soon."

Also much more content, especially skins and mounts. most fun when you play with friends ;) and hey its free to play so it should be easy to convince your friends to tag along right? not something i can relate on though... i have no friends.. 1 like is 1 prayer for me.

12355,"I spent thousand hours into this game, trust me, this game is so addicting but yeah this is not a perfect game here is my honest review

Pro
+ Better pace than any competitor, it's more fun and we are forced more into battle than camping
+ A lot of free good champions, you don't need to purchase anything to be a winner here
+ Cool design, in my opinion dev make cool character design here

Cons
+ Terrible server
+ Bad matchmaking

That's all I can say, overall this is a good game if you want to play overwatch for free"

12362,"Just recently tried this with one of my friends. I came from playing Overwatch since the release of it so I expected a similar product. Yet, somehow the UI is so buggy. The game itself feels like an actual mobile game, and I do understand this is a free game. But so is Dota and LoL and Valorant. This game actually has so many issues, it first got stuck opening on both of my monitors. Which has been a problem since 2016 that the creators have yet to address. The watching Ads for gold? Who does that anymore in this day and age? I was honestly amazed by how poorly this game functions. The actual in-game portion is simple and mindless and is just a clear ripoff but still partially enjoyable. But it does nothing to actually keep me engaged with how costly the new champions are and the grind to get them all just to try them out. But y'know what? Time to try Smite?"
12363,unga bunga

12392,Geiles Spiel und ist nur zu weiter empfehlen.
12393,good
12394,"This is a great game! While yes, I know to many it is considered an Overwatch copy, this game delivers new and unique features to the table that Overwatch has never implemented. It's unfortunate that Paladins was released only slightly after Overwatch, as many players now don't even give it a chance. It's free, the gameplay is fun, and the players have many more creative liberties when it comes to their characters. 

The game is not without its faults (servers aren't always the best, can be buggy at times, etc.), but the game still runs well most of the time and is all in all a fun experience. I'd urge you to at least try Paladins, as you might like what you find."

Stare at his n^^sack while I hold back my c*m tonight

But the fact is
I can never get off of his fat d^^k
And all that they can ask is
“I just wanna smack it” (I just wanna smack it)

I’ll just keep on suckin’, I’m good (Yeah, I’m good)

I will become dizzy
But it keeps us busy, I’m good (Yeah, I’m good)

I’vе been flirting with boys for so long
My jaw’s been hurting for so, so long it’s real
So long, it’s real, so long, it’s real

Kissin’ guys is all that I have practiced
Suckin’ glizzies while I’m on my mattress
I just really wish that I could smack it (I just wanna smack it)

12407,"Good game, definitely recommend"
12408,"Had more fun with Paladins than with Overwatch, i've always preffered paladins. The game never gets stale for me. I only have 5.4 hours but i can bet you that i had almost a full week of gameplay time on my ps4. The characters and gameplay have always stuck with me. I can't reccomend getting this game enough. It's literally free too. 9/10."
12409,"Pretty fun game, takes a little while to get enough gold for heros but not nearly as bad as league of legends. The matches are pretty short, but long enough to be interesting and matter. Matchmaking is pretty much as bad as any other online matchmaking. Overall very fun game for free."
12410,cacat de joc
12411,Nice game
12412,"Been playing for years and I gotta say it's an awesome game. Recommend it 100/100 if you are into fps shooter. The team works very hard and almost every month they release new updates and new champions everytime. The community is over the top. And this game has so much diversity it's not comparable to Overwatch, because it's better than Overwatch, more champions, more unique play styles and so on. This game has a bright future."

- Random team from Q-ing in the lobby will give you sh*t team that play like a bunch of monkeys.
- Reporting them for feeding and afk doesn't do sh*t. They still came up on your next matches.
- Daily quest never ending, means there's no rewards for you, bugs.
- Tons other bugs, that it's too long to mention. Check youtubes for these.
- You want to enjoy the game? Pay us money for the fun contents. And of course it's sold per PARTS.
- You want to play-for-free? Haha, enjoy your monkey team."

12531,"NEVER EVER bother playing this shit, Im a beta player, tried installing it again and they have literally fucked up a lot of sht"
12532,It's a game that looks shallow at first but the play styles available across a increasingly huge roster allows for incredible depth. There are point and click heroes with simple kits that can still be played a variety of different ways. When you feel comfortable enough with the item system and the mastery of easier characters the game has a great cast of easy to learn impossible to master champions that have a skill ceiling comparable to any shooter I've ever played. As for negatives the servers can be rough at times to the point of unplayability. Hitboxes can be incredibly forgiving to the point that you will question how you headshot someone you were barely even aiming at to begin with. I feel like this game will forever live in the shadow of more popular hero shooters but it's level design character kits and general game flow is in a league all it's own that deserves more attention.
12533,"cons: sometimes I think I'm playing against bots (generic names and not that great at the game), I've played for 2 hours and no one used voice chat ( I had to check to see if it was enabled), the game gets kind of repetitive 


pros: decent production value for the game, unique characters with good looking skins, it's fun for a minute


I gave it a thumbs up because it's better than many of the free hero shooters that keep coming out. Something is missing for me to keep coming back, i think it's the social aspect."

12556,i like this game
12557,"Yeah sure its a dope game, but kinda lacks somethin"
12558,"On balance I'd recommend this, but here are some positives and negatives.

Pros:  Fun hero based shooter, very similar to Overwatch in style.  The character designs are usually pretty good, some are quite interesting some a bit generic, but most feel like they have their own style.  The game is fairly populated, so match queues (as long as you select all game mods) aren't terribly long.  3 different standard game types (point push, team deathmatch, king of the hill) which gives the game some variety.

Cons:  There is some cheating; it doesn't appear to be as prevalent as it used to be but I've ran into at least 2 people running hacks in the last few days.  While not as bad as some games, the userbase can be very toxic at times.  The fast paced gameplay usually mitigates that, but it's not uncommon to see.  Some of the game balancing is very poor, and the development seems to be more geared towards putting out new characters than balancing the game.  It's not uncommon for quests to be implemented with bugs - this oddly seems to impact quests that provide currency rewards more often than others.  Fixes for these issues are not swift.  The netcode is rather mediocre - it is not uncommon to die when running away after fully being behind a wall.  It's not bad enough to be a deal breaker, but it is notable (and very annoying) from time to time.

Cash Shop: Most skins and cosmetics are behind (quite expensive) gatcha style chests.  If you have a single skin you want, you can't just buy that skin but have to buy chests that have a dozen to several dozen other possibilities.  As such, unless you're planning on whaling you likely won't get cosmetics that you want.  There are some side systems to gain special cosmetics, but they're generally poorly implemented to the point of irrelevance. 

On balance the game is pretty fun, and scratches the itch for that Overwatch style game.  I can't say I like some of the development choices or the cash shop design very much, but as the game is free it's hard to complain too much about that.  It's not nearly as polished or graphically impressive as Overwatch or other AAA caliber games, but it looks and plays quite well and is worth a shot if you're looking for a nice fast paced shooter."

12571,"[h1] My Impression [/h1]
I just recently liked to play something similiar like Overwatch and I thought to give Paladins a chance. Gameplay is exactly what I want. Everything fits nicely. It does have different features compared to Overwatch. Each Champion has its own unique playstyle. Additionally you can further customize your Loadout/the Skillset with Skill Cards, which are immediately provided as soon as you acquire the Champion. There are Items, which also adds more depth to customization during the Matches. Paladins has more customization, whereas Overwatch is just simply ""pick a Champ and go"". The decision making in Paladin in consideration to what Loadout and Items you buy is detrimental to your groups Strategies. I love it. I prefer games like this, where you need to figure out about the champion you play to understand its playstyle.

[h2]Results:[/h2]
After that said, as much as I like the game, I unfortunately cannot bring over my Heart to recommend it to anyone.


[b] There are several Points that completely shatters the enjoyment for this game:[/b]
[list]
[*] constant disconnects for me / other players when the game starts
[*] micro stuttering (i couldn't figure out if it concerns the connection or just bad coding)
[*] massive Lag Spikes, I already tried swichting regions just to see if there are any changes (there are many reports about it on reddit, discord, or just online and there are no solutions to this issue).
[*] all above issues just leads to a low player pool. I tried playing Ranked Games and I would need to wait at least more than +10 Minutes until a game has been found.
[/list]"
12572,yes
12573,i like it
12574,"nice games but there are many bugs in the game as soon as the updates come they are some what bugged
some of the quests are bugged"
12575,haha funny number go brrrrr
12576,The game is decent FPS shooter with some card game kinda vibe ..ngl  its overwatch but free however it isnt a  complete ripoff like how most people claim it to be and its fairly decent has some  of its own personal ideas..its got an active custom browser where people just simply have fun. the abilities are all cool and mostly all things could be achieved through just playing but there is a lot of cool cosmetics hid behind a paywall and no new gamemode updates that stay long are being added. personally if they update the game every 2 months or something i bet there would be more people playing this.
12577,goog
12578,a great game to just chill out and play. its also a great competitive game
12579,sd
12580,"where did my old account go, it just forces me into some new one??"
12581,It is a very good game to play with friends and its really fun I recommend you try it
12582,NO
12583,alright idk but it seems maive is attracted to me as she doesnt let any one on her team to kill me before she does if shes in the game and if im fighting someone else she goes across the map and just after i kill her teammate she ambushes and pounces onto me from the back like a horny dog.
12584,Old but gold
12585,"This game has a lot of variety in play style, 50 Champions to chose from which provides something for everybody, not only that with the Talent and Loadout system, Each Champion has multiple styles in which they can be played, You can turn a Support into a hybrid Damage dealer, a tank into a hybrid flank, A flank into a secondary healer, and so much more. the fact that this game is free compared to other games in this genre is crazy."
12586,I am definitely not the best person to get advice for this game as I only have around 8 hours on PC. I played a ton on PS4 and had around 4 characters over level 100. I have recently moved over to PC and it is a really active and good community as they don't flame you for being new or trash but accept that fact. I do think the game is amazing for being free and if you can't afford overwatch this is a good alternative.
12587,"p good, i want play of the game back"
12588,game fun
12589,"So attempting to be as reasonable as I can, here is a list of reasons I wouldn't recommend this game outright to anyone who is hoping to get a great experience from a free-to-play spin-off of Overwatch.

-The community is becoming increasingly toxic. Ultimately this stood as the primary cause for me to no longer indulge in this game - even occasionally - anymore. Honestly I have encountered many toxic people throughout my gaming life and I typically try to only play games with an emphasis on PvE and Co-operation. But this game takes the cake for a community experience I could no longer stomach, it literally started to make me physically sick and I felt myself becoming toxic to others. So, if ever I was cruel to anyone on this game for any reason, I apologize. But I digress, there were occasions where the matches were hard fought and the post game lobbies were filled with great feed back and respect for both the victors and the runners up as it felt like no one really outright ""won"" the match. But alas those occasions became too few and the toxicity began to reign over even matches where ones team managed a close win. So moving on.
-Patches fix some things and break others forever in a struggle to find balance amidst the imbalance.
-It is a free to play game, that being said naturally the cartoon aesthetic and ease of access draws a great number of people who want a casual experience. Which is completely fine. However I found towards the end of my time with this game (And I'm not certain the former is is the reason) People would frequently go afk without any real heads up or comment. Which again, is fine. But it became so prevalent it was hard not to feel the punishing impact of losing a teams healer or tank to (at times) several minuets of inactivity, sometimes in the midst of contesting the point or other meaningful engagements. And with such frequency it made one question ones commitment to winning. Once happened in 6 back to back games where we had someone go afk in the spawn or in the middle of a clash with the other team for more then a minute. So needless to say I logged off that session feeling drained and questioning my ability to derive enjoyment from something others just queue up and log off of or go and make a heartwarming cup of tea (fair to assume?) in the middle of.
-Bugs are abundant and have manifested in (but not limited to) key bindings randomly just unbinding despite the key binding menu showing abilities are in fact bound to the appropriate key. To be fair if can be easily fixed but in tight rounds where the littlest mistake can throw the game, it's a pain. Not to mention sometimes the keys unbind themselves mid match. But mostly I'll log on get into a match and find out my key bindings aren't functioning in the spawn before the match starts. No harm, no foul. 
-Abilities occasionally break at random and don't act right. For instance I was once silenced by Torvald for the last minute and half of a close match with the duration meter showing no duration for the ability's effect, which it normally does (Hacking perhaps?). On another occasion I initiated Grohk's special which should have sent the hero into a floating frenzy of buffing nearby friendlies and debuffing and inflicting minor damage to nearby opponents and instead (much to my chagrin) Grohk stuck to the ground without moving and I was easily eliminated.   
-Players tend to disruptively spam voice chat when they feel someone isn't doing what they expect (For example when they feel the healer isn't healing them specifically.*collective sigh*)
-Team composition is frequently irrelevant to some players resulting in unfair advantages for the opposing team if they have a more rounded team. Which isn't always necessary if the team itself is just loaded with talent.
-Match making is seemingly so inefficient that I have regularly spent weeks winning against opponents who are easily pushed into their spawn and there they exist for the entire match. And other times I have spent weeks winning 1 in every 10 matches. Consistently. Over and Over again, which consequently seems to bring out the most toxic of qualities of ones team mates. Like sitting in the spawn and refusing to do anything in the chat because they feel everyone is inferior to their next level talent. *Oof*
-Lastly it seems the development team struggles to effectively integrate new characters without (sometimes) weeks of unfair exploitation of new characters O.P abilities and builds. Which I will cut them some slack on the principle fact that this is a free-to-play game and they are likely a smaller team trying to fine tune a product that's only revenue is derived from Season Passes and cosmetic items. So I doubt the Q.C department is expansive. Not to mention this isn't their only IP, so I won't hate on them too much for this.

All in all, its worth a try if you're interested. But as a long term investment of ones time, I'd say get a kite, make a salad and eat it or something equally appropriate and healthy because games have been and always will be something one should do for ones enjoyment. I've lost my enjoyment of this game due to the above challenges this game poses. Nearly 500 hrs later, I wish I would have invested my time into something that didn't see me descend to others level of angst and misguided anger over something that should make you feel like perpetuating something other then hate and ridicule. Go pet a kitty, or eat an apple in a meadow, something, anything! Just don't feed into the toxic atmosphere on here or anywhere, this is - sadly - all some people have."

12610,Games is ok-ish. But has a lot of bugs. Most often ones: After game ends you are stuck at black screen with some sounds from games and only way to exit is to alt-tab away(you are not credited for that game in daily rewards). Another very usual bug is when you reroll or end quest they are still present. They update only if you exit game.
12611,Underrated game

12629,"Balancing, poor QOL, and bad management. 

Balancing: Champions all fill a very specific niche. That being said, your choice of champion is locked in during the duration of a game, but, that's where cards and items come in, to fill potential niches by giving small and large buffs to specific mechanics. This quickly becomes irrelevant when the meta is quite strictly defined by what cards you're running and what items you buy in the duration of a match. Additionally, the champion ultimate abilities are all insanely good or insanely bad; example: Drogos' ultimate has him fly through the air at a high speed, instantly killing the first person he collides with, regardless of health, damage resistance or shield amount, while Octavia's ultimate is a bunch of random moderately-sized beams that maybe deal 1/3 of an enemies health and are incredibly easy to avoid (I can only recall one time I was ever hit by one, and that was because the ultimate is generally so bad, it doesn't even matter that it does hit you, so I didn't bother avoiding them). The teams you get put on are usually either getting demolished by the enemy team, or stomping the enemy team so hard they don't even leave the spawn room, with very few in-between.

QOL: There are certain systems in the game that just feel tedious to use, despite everything being relatively simple. I would also like to extend this to the design of certain aspects that just make them unnecessarily annoying and/or hard to work around: a notable one that comes to mind is a broken pillar in the spawn room on Frog Isle, you have about a 20% chance to spawn behind it and get stuck for a moment, while you are taking a second to realize you got stuck in the first place. Some collision is outright bad, like when you'll get caught on a random corner that didn't appear to have any texture there; there's a massive boulder on Jaguar Falls where exactly that happens. Copy & paste doesn't work in chat boxes (presumably to combat bad formatting, but the chat system so annoying to use in the first place, IDK why anyone would bother).

Bad management: The community will want something, and the developers will add something completely different. *You want classic Siege? You get another Siege gamemode except we add something new to it every once in a while. You want champions with new designs? Here's another incredibly edgy guy with a generic gun... BUT WAIT, he can CHANGE HIS FIRING MODES.* While the game is seeing regular updates and new content, the regular updates barely change anything, and the new content is rather lackluster or uninspired. It's clear that what they're putting out in terms of actual gameplay is rushed at best, but often nonexistent, and skins are a higher priority. I want there to be more Limited Time Modes, because they bring a new take to the gameplay and strategies involved, but, like the name implies, they're rarely around. Anything to work with that would genuinely change the flow of the game as much as Limited Time Modes or the ancient PVE modes would be a very good thing to have, even if they're only implemented as Custom Games players have to host (maybe it will finally be used for something other than mechanic testing).

Regrettably, I can't stop playing this game and occasionally spending money on it. It may be an annoying game to play, but its the only semi-modern game that retains some level of replayability, even if that level is low.

An update: I have a new system, and it seems like some ""stars-aligned"" issue popped up that's such a specific combination of this computer, Windows, and this game that causes mouse inputs to completely blank out for seconds at random periods of times. It's not a mouse issue, since it persists between different mice, it's not an input issue, as the keyboard still works, it's not an USB issue, as controllers still work, and it's not a hardware issue, as it doesn't happen in other games. It could only reasonably be an issue with this game or its interaction with Windows, or those two also combined with the hardware. I blame it on Hi-Rez in general, as the only other game that has this issue is Realm Royale, the battle royale game that's literally the same as Paladins apart from a handful of gameplay details."

12639,this game is probably one of the worst games i've played. Horrible gameplay with constant glitches and lags. Special abilities do not work on half of the characters. I actively demote this game due to the lack of effort on the development team and just a lazy approach to the updates. HORRIBLE GAME! WOULD NEVER RECCOMEND

12660,this game is really run its like csgo and valorant combined but with different agents and different gamemodes. 100% recommed playing Paladins.
12661,I am gonna start by saying I quite enjoy this game! I played on the Xbox in 2019 but got back into it recently on PC and it has been a blast! I have one issue that is making this game start to turn south and that is the Deserter feature. My internet has been quite spotty recently and every time I lag in the game I get disconnected and I get deserter for three minutes. This disengages me from the game and ruins my experience and it is just getting worse!
12662,"very fun and unique with different game modes it offers unique experiences
"
12663,"The game is good when you have friends to play with. Otherwise the matchmaking is an all new type of cancer. Like, 99% of the time, your teammates are level 4 newbies who don't know what they're doing and your enemies are fucking esports legends with Navy Seals level coordination. The matchmaking is so bad, how the fuck is it still like this after YEARS?? Just match me with people of equal level, a little higher or a little lower. AND WHEN YOU DO, BALANCE OUT THE FUCKING TEAMS! There's like 5 level 3,000,000 people and 5 level 20~ people per match. and the game decides ""oH LeTs PuT aLl ThE nEw PeOpLe On OnE tEaM aNd AlL tHe gRaNdMaStErS oN tHe OtHeR"" LIKE THATS BALANCED??

Solo Paladins is an awful, enraging stupid mess that does not allow any fun because you're constantly gonna get hammered by veterans unless you've also sunk 3,000 hours into the game.

That being said

10/10 would recommend"
12664,"Great game, akin to Overwatch (a bit better IMO), no P2W schemes, but my god the ranked que times. Sat in one fo 15 min, ban phase takes forever once you get there, and afterwards the pick phase is even slower as people wait till the timer hits 1 to lock in. Kinda annoying on all accounts."

I can assure you though, 1 game each week will be normal probably, so you can have fun on it. If you wanna be calm, avoid this game at all costs, it will make you throw your pc/console or whatever."

12693,eh it's a good game i guess
12694,"People say that this game is a rip off of Overwatch but tbh I hard disagree. It has a really cool in-match store system that helps countering the enemy team rather than counter switching, loadout builds to help you make your already crazy gameplay even crazier, and a really diverse cast of characters.  For sure try this game if you're into Overwatch and geeky games like League of Legends :)"
12695,"You need to pretty much know how to use champions, especially the ones you like, make builds for them, and have to cooperate with your teammates if you want to usually win. Pretty good strategy pvp game imo"
12696,Fucking hot garbage. This game blows asshole. I can see myself playing for many more hours
12697,"Played back when it was in Beta, was pretty good tbh with only a few things annoying. But after coming back to the game 2 times, years apart. It seems to have been getting worse. Half the games I played when I gave the game a 3 chance was filled with bot players (Actual bots, not trash teammates) and the ranking is horrible. On top of that, flanks are still an issues being way too strong with what they can do to most if not all classes. And the game just feels overall unbalanced. 

Yes back then everything was unbalanced, but it was fun to a point. But not after I tried it a while ago, it feels dead more then anything. Too many bots, ranked games are useless to play, and  team matchmaking feels horribly unbalanced."

12853,pretty fun. i play as support
12854,very good game
12855,"Not much to say about a free to play game its easy to get into you can hop on for a few games to waste some time cause the matches are so short. The hero's look nice and I haven't seen any OP hero's in my short time playing but I could be wrong. People compare it to OverWatch yeah they are both hero shooters that's about it you don't have to fill a role for the holy trinity ( Tank Healer DPS ) if you don't want to. Overall Paladins is a fun game to pick up and play with friends since its F2P it has a decent champion pool that's always growing.

12858,you miss having fun in overwatch? play this.
12859,I love everything about this game
12860,"At the beginning it was very nice to play a shooter which is like Overwatch, but after 100 hrs. or more you notice, that there is no diffrent in the game, the updates are´nt that good and everytime there is a new ""Champion"" in the game he is to op. (the balance patch need to long  (3-4 weeks))

12861,fun if you have a character that suits you
12862,progress went bye bye
12863,eh its ok i guess
12864,game balance
12865,I ain't gonna lie. I typically just play the TDM mode nowadays and still have a blast. The characters are cool.
12866,this game is so much fun... its like if you took overwatch and made it good
12867,It is really great
12868,the greatest game ever made overwatch copied
12869,best game i ever play after overwatch .. i like this game .. the combat so similar with overwatch .. but overwatch more better .. i have played this game for 5 years .. first i play this game is 2016 mybe ... until now
12870,describe what? i like playing this game as it is.
12871,intresting game with many different characters to pick from if you want something just to pick up and have some fun with i would chose this game

12887,"poggers game i love it better than overwatch poo poo pee pee
"
12888,it fun but will run in to tryhards  will not make it fun
12889,"TL;DR; I see no reason not to try it.

Overwatch, but;

- Fun
- Free*
- Buggy**
- Less competitive***
- Less polished
- Less precision
- Worse physics
- More of a moba
- Booba+

(*)  F2P , still need to unlock heroes, but its extremely easy to do so . Just as you feel like you wanna try another champ, you have enough gold for it. Also can unlock them for a reasonable price. Lets not forget the hero rotations.
(**) I am not saying Overwatch is a bug free game, just look at Doomfist bug list, but this game takes the concept of a buggy game to a whole other level. Some things you see in this game  makes you question certain things about the whole development process, I will leave it at that.
(***) When you first start the game, it all feels like a generic dumbed-down fps game with its colossal hit-boxes, sluggy physics and seemingly OP and forgiving mechanics. But there is actually a lot more depth then it looks to this game, unfortunately, all for the wrong reasons. The skill cap of this game look like overcoming the things I mentioned above. You need to be extremely fast, elusive and accurate at the same time while maintaining game sense, one small mistake means you are dead cuz its extremely hard to actually miss your shots, again for the same reasons mentioned. To me its not worth trying to master set of skills that  translate minimally to other games just cuz devs visioned the game as something that everybody can feel like they are good at.

12898,Keep playing it until u find the joy of shooting people
12899,knock-off overwatch but is really fun for some reason 10/10
12900,"This is a fun game. While older and not as populated as something like Overwatch, it does have a complexity with the card system that is being stolen for Overwatch 2 (if that company still exists after all their lawsuits, though they'll probably be bought by 10cent).  Steam reports around 12k players all the time, so it's unlikely you'll wait for a team for long. The games are faster than Overwatch, most appearing to clock in at about 3-4 minutes less on average than Overwatch."

I main Vatu now and have the new Mayhem skin, which is one of the coolest skins w some sick voice lines. Good game otherwise :)"
12906,"Unbalanced game, over-powered characters are not nerfed whereas weaker characters are left in the dust and not given any attention. Quest system broken half of the time. Crowd control is cancerous."

12920,honestly more fun than i expected. give it a shot if u enjoy pvp
12921,It's okay.
12922,"Good game which is more fun than Overwatch imo but the constant crashing, game breaking bugs, 80% of matches having bots as teammates, terrible matchmaking in casuals e.g grandmasters vs unranked/silvers and 5 man stacks vs randoms, server issues, and toxicity is what made me quit. Please play a different game."
12923,good game
12924,"Even though I own overwatch as well, I would say I often prefer Paladins. The fantasy-esque setting of paladins is more in line with my style than the near-future modern setting of overwatch. I also prefer the hero roster of paladins over overwatch, especially since I main support (the selection of support characters in paladins is better in my opinion. I will say that it lacks some important features that overwatch has, like specific role-queueing, and I don't love how you have to unlock all the characters seperately (as opposed to overwatch, which has all the characters playable from the beginning), but I understand why, as its a free game and they need to have some way of making money, but I have to restate that this is A Free Game. I would even go so far as to say that its not even pay-to-win, as you can unlock ALL the characters through in-game currency. Overall, I would say that I prefer this game to overwatch, and I would like to see the game continue to grow. I can honestly say that I would have absolutely paid for this game, and will likely be spending some of my hard-earned cash to unlock all the characters in order to support the creators (despite the fact that I'm loyal to my main, Ying). 

My advice to you, dear reader, is to invest some time into the game, and see for yourself what makes It a game able to equal--and in my opinion, exceed--overwatch. Try not to let the occasional glitch or lag get you down, and take my word that you may have found what you're looking for if you dont want to empty your wallet for overwatch. I acknowledge that this game might not be for everyone, but if you like the Hero-Shooter formula, I couldn't recommend it higher. And if you're new to the genre, I wish you luck on your journey. 

Did I mention it's free?"

12933,"Honestly, this isnt a bad game. But its not worth investing any meaningful time into. 
Mainly, because the average matchmaking experience is toxic and unenjoyable and there is nothing you can do about it. Also, the grind to make enough gold to buy new champions to try out is unbearable. A toxic game, locked behind paywalls. It's a shame because its great to see a F2P hero shooter, and like i said it isnt a bad game at its core. No hate on the devs, but I cant keep playing this"

I recommend people to play this game and I hope you get a taste of a older friend or a role model and don't take them for granted."
12958,fun game
12959,"I liked the idea of Overwatch, but I really thought the balance team worked at the player's expense. I also think the way that Overwatch was implemented was really poorly thought out with their laning system or how ults and their ability guarantee removal would really cause the games to be sloppy.

Paladins offers a much better balance, core gameplay, and map planning at the expense of some EXTREMELY buggy client architecture and specific game mechanics. I love playing this game, and I can play it comfortably solo. I'd say the best way to enjoy it is with a group of 3+ people for the team of 5. It is rare that a casual game can be ruined just for 1 bad player. Draft pick is very fun in ranked. It's a little hard to come up with builds without netdecking, but other than that the game is in a very healthy place and the devs are very good at tweaking it. I trust their decisions moving forward. Even while it is dripping with jank."

There are 2 negative things I can think about this game is when you do solo-queue, you'll either get a good team or a poo poo team. The other reason is you'll get that one person who'll be toxic to you if you don't perform how they want you to preform, if that makes sense.

13016,"Paladins: Champions of the Realm is a 2018 free-to-play online hero shooter video game by Hi-Rez. The game was developed by Evil Mojo, an internal studio of Hi-Rez and was released on May 8, 2018 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, followed by a Nintendo Switch version released on June 12, 2018.

Paladins is a team-based first-person shooter that focuses on two groups of five players each, who compete for combat-based goals. The game is set in colorful sci-fi fantasy maps, where each player chooses a champion that cannot be repeated in the same team and cannot be changed in the match. Each champion has their own weapons, skills and fighting style; in addition, they can be enhanced and personalized from a card and skin system. The interface of each player is very profitable and customizable, with avatars and customizable borders to symbolize the player's profile; titles when reaching mastery level 30 with a champion, among others."
13017,"People hate on this game, but it's quite fun. The characters are obviously quite different compared to overwatch, and the game gives you a lot of variety. Overall I've had a lot of fun :) especially since it's free. Not really a toxic community either, at least compared to the overwatch community."

13045,"Fun game if you cant afford Overwatch. I mean, even if you can (buy overwatch) this game is still pretty fun and kinda easy. Just dont play ranked because it takes so long to get into a game just to get steamrolled by people who are way better than you because skill based matchmaking in ranked, doesnt work.

I like the game when playing on console, but I'd like to play it on pc but it just isn't working. I don't know where else to say anything, but I am still reviewing the game (8/10) so I hope this doesn't get taken down."

Das Spiel macht Super viel Spaß, bis mann sich Overwatch holt und mann bemerkt das Overwatch besser ist. Jedoch finde ich die horoes in Paladins besser gestaltet.

13064,Decent game
13065,"This game has the most broken matchmaking i have ever seen in any game.
Be ready to have lots of trolls and afk players in your team."
13066,"What Overwatch wishes it was.  Just plain fun and from a dev that seems to actually care about the game being good.

Why isn't this more popular is the real question."

13073,"This game is a shitty first person MOBA, but if you have friends, it's great (kinda) Also all characters suck, are unbalanced, and I don't think this company has ever made a single patch for this game"
13074,Great game.

13077,Its good something
13078,This game is AWSOME if youve played overwatch and like overwatch try this if you havent played it try it anyway
13079,Used to be good but is now trash this game is impossible to enjoy as a solo player due to all the Braindead teammates and the meta is god awful
13080,GOOD GAME
13081,Hi-Rez always makes amazing characters with good enough games around them. There are so many unique champions to choose from and you only need to find a few you like to have a great time with this game.
13082,"Played this game for so long, so much put in, never fail to be disappointed. Lets start from the beginning. This game has lots of bugs, mostly fixed but there's still a whole bunch, speaks about the amount of bugs eh?  Server's are bad, really bad. There was even a point in time where an entire region of players played with 250ping. And when you though things couldn't be worse, you realise you can't jump! The players are toxic, but that applies to all games with some form of competitive aspects. However, Paladins have an insane amount of people who are toxic but doesn't even know how to play the game! A once beloved game, so much effort and time put in, just to get more and more disappointed with both the company and playerbase with every patch they put out. 

Oh and guess what, achievements in this game means jack. Why? Here's why. Season 1 competitive lasted for so long that GM doesn't even matter anymore as so many people can get it simply by grinding. In season 2, the game company screwed up their system and anyone, literally ANYONE, can email them and ask for the GM border. In season 3, they screwed up once again and some people who deserves the GM border don't get it and others who didn't even reach GM got the border. What's worse? Emailing Hi rez don't work as they'll simply deny or ignore. Season 4 is currently on-going. Guess what? In the midst of Season 4, they announce there'll be no longer GM borders. Not before the season started, IN THE MIDST. Therefore, people actually put in effort to reach there, don't get rewarded at all. What a mess."
13083,"The game used to be really good.Now there's a lot of Malos viktor tyra vivian zhin mains, so if you don't want to get cancer, I'd say don't install it because I don't have the game anymore when I write this comment and I deleted it. I'm sick of smurfs opening new czars and trolling gold, and I'm sick of 1st picks who think they're shit. However, the reason I recommend this game is Kinessa and the old Torvald. Whether it's new bps or new updates, the game is heading for shit, and it's not as much as it used to be. I'll tell my master the Octavia-themed nessa talent is shit. I'm sorry I didn't delete payload mode before it came back because it couldn't take any more toxic gamers m.EU servers and bugs will be back on the market as a very nice game if it's fixed and it's no longer anime, but I don't think it's going to live much longer if it doesn't happen. If you upload it again, I'd say load it with a friend because that's what I did, and that's why I lasted this long. Good luck"
13084,bad game
13085,better than overwatch
13086,imagine grinding when you can just use the rotation lol
13087,Great game even if you don't spend any money. Seems balanced and I like the different roles you can play. I really enjoy running support. The available customization of how you spec your character is nice.
13088,"waiting for the day they fix their hit boxes and their top play system, otherwise still a good game imo"
13089,"gud 
"
13090,Game crashes constantly and is full of bugs! Matchmaking is really bad and the players are toxic. Do not recommend!
13091,The game is awesome and unique. I like it way better than overwatch.
13092,It's a nice game but it needs some polishing around the edges and for the devs to stop briging out broken chanpions. Those two are in my opinion the only thing that kills the game. Because of the new champtions some of the older ones are unplayable or not being played. Some reworks and balance patches and the game is a very good game to play. Competitive and just for fun. I spend a good ammount of hours playing this game and it was fun.

13104,game pog
13105,"You've probably heard about how this game likes to ""borrow"" from other games, and it's a true part of their marketing strategy, but it's definitely its own game, and it's fun and satisfying to play.  My only criticisms are that the User Interface, cosmetic content, and map complexity seems limited compared to the time the game has been out.  Forward development doesn't appear to have as much staffing or resources as it should.  Forward development is slow, but it's there."
13106,Semi cheaply made Overwatch knockoff with deckbuilding mechanics. Gameplay isn't bad if you understand the roles. Mostly fun. Full of woke nonsense. I'm not about that life. I award you zero points and may God have mercy on your soul.
13107,"Good, but need to improve the system to make it more interesting and attractive for players."
13108,"This game is so fun to play that the gang still plays it despite not being able to play for one hour straight without having an issue with bugs, lags, disconnections and whatnots. Worth playing if you have enough patience"
13109,If its made my Hi-rez. its garbage.
13110,yes
13111,Paladins is one of the most amazing games in the world.

13114,.
13115,very good but the community is quite toxic sometimes pls be careful
13116,"While the grind for characters is exhausting, the card system and making builds is a lot of fun! One can make a flank bulky, or make a healer a big offensive threat. It is a lot of variety and overall a great time."
13117,Just an easier and more fun overwatch
13118,"Like League of Legends and Overwatch had a baby or an fps objective based version of Smite. Think I'll be playing this game more while I #boycott Blizzard. 

Real talk though, Hi-Rez has to low key be putting bots in some matches, cause the mental aptitude and fps gaming sense of some of my teammate or enemies are non-existent at times. It's not like this game is even that difficult, the hit box is so generous compared to other fps games, and characters are not that difficult to play or learn in the slightest. 
Like, pally, how are you so bad and unaware at times? U got to be a bot."
13119,coming from overwatch this game is more fun to play and more forgiving also/

13168,"Crap Game. 

Match Making is garbage. You get 1 good game then the rest are shit. 

Every match you play your enemy team seems MLG, and your Team is just running around flanking as healers, not playing objective. 

Spent hundreds of hours on this game between Switch and PC. 

Not worth it at all. Garbage game."

13176,"After playing overwatch for years and hearing about this game... i thought why not give it a go. Haven't looked back at overwatch since, having much more fun and the community isn't as toxic either, plus smurfs can't troll which is a few bonuses. Not only that, you can play what ever you like and wont get moaned at by someone else because it's ""not meta"" or ""no tanks"" yet can still win with the match without the meta and tanks."

i cant recomend it because the bug in this game increase over time and sometimes make it unplayable 

new update = new severe bug"

13192,"People call it an Overwatch clone, but it's just a hero shooter. I think Paladins is better than Overwatch and more fun. Many characters with strong powers. The character movement is very well done.
My main character is Maeve."
13193,"So fun, easy to get into, and great community :)"
13194,Paladins had a black woman in it before Overwatch
13195,good
13196,Amazing game!
13197,Good game
13198,"Played the game on console and wanted to hop on the game on PC for a few quick matches, only to play against bots and never see an enemy that wasn't an AI.  Why would anyone want to play against bots, even if they are new to the game?  Just boring, especially when you can go 30-0 because the AI is so laughable."
13199,"better overwatch only because of the talent/card system, meta also seems more diverse"
13200,Make paladins great again
13201,IT IS GOOD
13202,It's Overwatch but it's not run by molesters at Activision Blizzard and also it's free
13203,Betty La Bomba
13204,Not too sure...
13205,"This game used to be fun, but cheating and completely broken balance means one person ends up running the map in 9/10 games. Go play smite instead, it's waaaay better and not broke af."
13206,Raum from paladins is so cool guys you should get this game to see him
13207,"fuck this game --- I don't like it, I love it"

13213,It is better than Overwatch now. Also the tf2 skin for Barik is dope.
13214,"Well...

It started off as an Overwatch clone, back when we called everything an Overwatch clone. Played it, enjoyed it, then after a few years it actually left it's ""Early access"", and now here we are...

Honestly, it was enjoyable back then, and I'm gonna give it the benefit of the doubt, as well as the benefit of thinking the updates only made it better, and say: Yeah, play it."

13262,"NOICE I PLAY LOYT WID FWEINDZ
"
13263,"This is one of my favorite shooters. It has lots of content, and more frequent character releases than most competitive games. It offers a great balance between strategy, tactics, and mechanical skill, so none of them feels overwhelmingly strong on it's own. The game is very fun with a premade team or without.

""Why play this game over Overwatch, or another shooter?""
Most shooters including Overwatch have a very large emphasis an mechanical skill. Paladins offers loadouts as well as items you can obtain in-game that offer more levels of play than Overwatch or other shooters offer. I have played pretty much every big shooter on the market, and have put 1,000 hours into Rainbow on PC. I had gotten the highest platinum rank, falling a game short of diamond on console when diamond was the highest rank. My meaning in saying this is that I can play other shooters quite well, but Paladins is easily one of the top shooters I have played.

And as a heads up if you are about to or just created an account: The game will pit you against teams of bots at first, and when I played at least, they did not tell you they were bots. Just don't let your beginning bot matches ruin your experience. If anything, use it as an opportunity to experiment with all the characters you have access to. You will know you aren't fighting bots anymore when you start seeing enemy team toxicity in the endgame screen XD."
13264,Not that good honestly
13265,Very fun game

13273,You can't get the free daily crystals anymore :c . Now there is basically no way of obtaining skins other than paying money. I liked it when in the good old days u could save up crystals and buy stuff. It did take a while to get an amount that u need but it was worth it... Yea big sad
13274,tf2 better this game sucks
13275,ok
13276,"This game is super fun, there are not a bunch of extra buttons to do random crap.  Its basic abilities and just an all out battle."
13277,if you love RPG you will get hooked.
13278,"Overall, this game is great! I remember playing this game all the time with my dad, and I recently got back into it! Must say, worth the 25 GB download. The characters are all so diverse and unique, each having their own personalities, so they don't just feel like a shell of a character. The abilities are fun to use, and all the characters have their pluses and minuses that balance them out pretty well. Another  great thing, while you can spend money to purchase characters or currencies, you don't have to in order to win. The game lets you stay a F2P as long as you want! Its great. I love it when games don't force micro-transactions down my throat. 

Again, 100% would recommend this game to players looking for a good, team-based FPS game.

Edit: Okay, there are a few broken characters (Yagorath, Raum, Corvus), but they still have counterplay and a few minuses that make them killable.

Edit 2 (2022): I feel like Hi-Rez is currently doing far too much creating and not enough balancing. They need to cool it on the new champions and balance the ones that already exist!"
13279,It contains very interactive gameplay and also requires mastery. This game is also doesnt have a pay to win system
13280,Pay To Win Characters. Grind 1 month for 1 character. What a great game... Palladium !
13281,mmm
13282,game crashes every 20 minutes but it has bewbs

Reminds me of the good days of Overwatch. Looking forward to actually diving in."

13304,Fun.
13305,They updated their privacy policy in April and I find that it's overstepping their bounds. This isn't the only game out there with bad privacy practices but I don't play or support those either. Since I have to agree to it to play the game I won't play it and am uninstalling. It was a fun game while it lasted tho.
13306,"Very good FPS game to get into coming from a 10 Year MMORPG Former Pro DOFUS Player transitioning back to FPS genre games. You learn how to build loadouts, counter draft your enemies, and overall have fun with friends in the other game modes available. Out of the 50 champions to pick from chances are there some champion that would tickle your fancy. This game has similarities between some Overwatch champions in terms of abilities however the card loadout system allows you to not be so linear in your point and click shooting ways. 

TLDR: 10/10 Game Overwatch but with Yugi-oh Cards."
13307,Fun game.  Their design on the char and maps address most of my complaints about overwatch.  Good size roster to find champ you like.  Ults are OP and more or less decide match.  Map design is much cleaner avoiding hard chokes on push maps.  Item buying lets you adjust against the opposing team comp on the fly.  Character customization gives you more freedom in how you play the various champs.   Does have lackluster menu and some issues with character models catching terrain sometimes.

"
13321,its copy for overwatch for free
13322,"Pros: 
- It's free, and you can get a lot of stuff just by playing.
- Doesn't requiere too much resources, you can run this on a toaster.
- 50+ Champions with different builds, lots of variety.
- The Season Pass events are the absolute best, you can get crystals (the premium coin) just by completing challenges.
- 4 Rotation Champions per-week, so you can try new characters without commiting to buy them.
- Every champion in the game is available for practice mode, rather you have it or not.
- Really cool gameplay, its a shooter in combination with a moba, but has a freestyle flavor to it as well.
- You get benefits by playing on a party with your friends.

Cons:
- Its pretty buggy, they eventually solve them, but there's always a glitch to complaing.
- Ranked mode doesn't allow a full party of 5 people, only 2, this is dumb considering the fact that is a team-based game.
- It has some balance issues."

"
13333,"I'm gonna be using Overwatch as a comparison for this review. This is also gonna be a pretty messy review...I'm not good at reviewing games and stuff and giving a full opinion, especially when comparing it to something, but I'll try my best.

Gameplay:
I know some people might just classify it under ""garbage Overwatch copies"" but i think it deserves a little more respect than that. Just because it's a first person shooter with playable & unique characters doesn't mean it's a wannabe Overwatch and that it can't be fun. I think the whole concept of an item shop to counter champions and abilities that might be a pain for your team composition is neat and is the reason why I think, as far as gameplay goes, Paladins kinda beats Overwatch. Yes, I'm aware that you can swap heroes in Overwatch to counter the enemy's team composition but I think the item shop is still a better idea than being to swap characters mid-match. In Overwatch, if I even want a chance at winning, I have to swap heroes which means I won't be able to play the character I want to and might even end up playing a character I hate playing as. In Paladins, I can play whoever I want and just buy items instead of having to switch to an entirely different character and playstyle. I feel more freedom in playing a character because of the different loadouts and builds I can make to better fit what I like to play. 

Graphics:
I think this game is a pretty good example of ""a game doesn't need good graphics to be enjoyable"" and even with that said, the graphics aren't the worst in the world. The graphics reach the perfect point where they're not 11/10 but they're not so garbage that it hurts to look at. I do have a problem with lag, though. Like, severe lag. I don't want to completely blame this on the game because my computer does lag sometimes but it's not as bad as it can get in this game. Sometimes I'll lag back, like, 30 steps backwards. It doesn't happen every match but it's definitely something I want to address because it doesn't get that bad with other games like, well, Overwatch or any other games I play on this same PC.

Small Things:
Characters aren't as iconic looking as Overwatch's roster (with the possible exception of Androxus) but that's kinda forgivable since it's not as big as of a game as Overwatch is/was. I don't really wanna talk about balancing stuff and all that because I'm not really good at determining if something is actually ""op"" or ""game breaking"" unless it's painfully obvious that it is, so I'll leave game balance stuff out of this review (unless you want to count the bit about the item shop, but that's up to you). As far as the community goes, aside from a couple of douchebags here and there, I'd say it's not too bad. As a matter of fact, I'd say it's better than Overwatch's community. Don't get me wrong, I've encountered plenty of genuinely nice people in Overwatch, but the amount of toxic players in Overwatch kinda beats the amount in Paladins. I'm speaking for myself, of course, so if it's different for some other people who have more hours than me then I completely understand but from personal experience, Paladins has been a bit more pleasant. I do have a massive problem with how much money I feel like I have to spend, though. Now, obviously, the game is free to play and has micro transactions but good lord...the only skins you can get without spending money is the mastery skins. The obsidian skin, the cosmic skin (or something like that), and the golden skin at level 50. Some champions don't even have the obsidian and cosmic skins. I'm typing this review before I've really tried any of the new updates so this might not be an issue like it used to be when I started playing and, if it has been changed, please correct me. This might only be a problem that I have, though, since I don't really wanna dump a ton of money on the game right now but I just kinda wanted to mention this.

Conclusion:
I'd honestly say the gameplay is a bit more balanced than Overwatch's because of the item shop and more freedom you can have when picking a character. The graphics aren't eye burning. The community is, in my personal opinion, a bit more pleasant than Overwatch's community. Now, I definitely believe the game has problems, It's not flawless like I'm making it out to be. I do still kinda prefer Overwatch over this game but this isn't a review about Overwatch so I won't get into that. Overall, not 100% better than Overwatch but it's definitely worth your time. If you want a game like Overwatch but you don't wanna spend money, then this is your game, You might get the same amount of fun out of this game that you'd get out of Overwatch, if not more fun (sometimes). This is a messy AF review but it's only, like, my second steam review ever so don't judge too hard."

13344,"where overwatch trumps paladins in graphics, paladins tramples overwatch in sheer content and depth. every hero gets their own individual build, and MOST hero's  can pivot into dps where its needed. have a 2 tanks? not a problem, one person can spec into a competent dps version and help get picks. not to mention this game is FREE. it doesnt really get much better than this."
13345,"Very fun, lots of champions to choose from and unique attacks."
13346,"Despite the game being plagued with bugs, the developer is Hi-Rez (poor man's EA), and the dev team never listens to the community about basic balancing issues, the I still continue to play the game frequently. I used to actually pay for things, but as time went on and I noticed that the Dev team was giving up on the game and moving to their new game (Rogue Company), I almost get the feeling that Hi-Rez takes money from Paladins and throws it into RoCo, and that game is very boring to me by comparison to Paladins."

13355,Too easy
13356,i guess yea lol
13357,"The gameplay is good. Almost every champion is unique, and requires you learn a new way to play the game. It's much faster-paced than something like overwatch. There are a lot of pros to get into, such as it being a completely free game with no pay-to-win aspects to it. 

There are however, also some fatal flaws. 
- The balance is oftentimes a mess, with questionable nerfs and buffs. 
- Player retention relies on the sunken cost fallacy. That is when you continue to come back to something due to how much money you've spent rather than the game actually having improved. 
- The current state of the game involves cheaters, drophackers, and toxic individuals not being banned due to the team fearing a decrease in player numbers. There is no enforcement to keep toxic players at bay.
- Only the most popular champions get skins, and oftentimes they are extremely sexual. Sex sells, but male champions are severely underappreciated.
- The lore is a mess. New champions being added does nothing to help anything but player numbers, and most of all is a disservice to the lore.
- Customer service being passive-aggressive and unhelpful towards players who are angry about misleading marketting.
- The website literally doesn't work. You cannot report players through the website because it is so damn slow to load that your report needs you to do the recaptcha before its ever sent to the support team.
All of this is ignoring the stability issues, from spaghetti code that has the dev team scared to work with it, to the game being literally unplayable on the nintendo switch due to crashing the moment you boot up the game. 

tl;dr At this time the game is falling prey to short-term profit. There is no goal to keep players. Playing the game itself is fun, but ultimately will be damaging to your mental health. The matchmaking is so bad you can go days without winning, and nothing is done about toxic players due to the fear of losing player numbers.

If you're looking for something to sate your thirst for Overwatch-style gameplay then keep looking."
13358,It need some grind but is a fun fps
13359,its ight i mean the games isnt that bad
13360,"it is a pretty good game and i am having a blast playing it. You should play it if you like games such as Overwatch. The graphics are nice and cartoony. 
My only sugestione is to lower the price of heroes or make the coin dops more often and higher. 9/10"
13361,"I can't with this buggy ass game. There are more bugs to discover than champions. I like the game I think it could be awesome but don't waste your time playing a game made by devs that don't give a crap about the game and just want to get the last bit of money before it dies by releasing seasons of cosmetics instead of bug fixes.
Could be a good game though, I'm just disappointed in HyRez and I kinda expected this from Evil Mojojojo tbh."

13388,it was fun
13389,Shit version of Overwatch for hobos. Characters sucks the maps sucks. Battle Pass like in every game. Need to pay to play the characters and they have shit abiltys. Plus characters are not balanced at all. The game is made for autistic people. Play it if you want to have cancer. Please remove it from steam and all plateforms. It's evil the dev team needs to be locked up in a cage.
13390,fun enough

13401,it has engineer gaming.
13402,"Amazing experience, short rounds which do not make you angry. Even though there are donations, the effect is not really visible in matchmaking. The only negative factor is the graphics but by using the NVIDIA filters I was able to improve them.

I recommend this game for people who play with friends but for solo players, I am not really sure if it is a good decision. 

8/10

P.S. I have used the sharpening filter."
13403,fine
13404,good game
13405,As a free game this is actually really good.but they should stop changing the meta every patch
13406,"This game has really awesome character concepts and the game designers deserve all the praise in the world. Sadly, this game was developed by hi-rez so the polish and the people in charge of implementing the designers amazing ideas are abysmal. Very close to a perfect game, but not quite worth the time instead of just buying Overwatch."

13411,awesome
13412,"here is why I say this game is bad, back in a day when it was made public I had account (on there page), I had all heroes unlock and I had give them money to unlock those heroes, I think it was around 20 euro and I have stop playing for about a month or two and when i have return to it I got BAN after first match, no response to WHY I got ban or anything, my account was gone and all the character that I level, ALL of it. Then I stop playing for a long time and then I try it on steam and what I found is that game is HARD on FTP players, from 10k coins to unlock a character they rise it to 60k now you thinking your self that is not bad well think that each battle you get around 400 coins if you WIN that is, unlocking stuff is not made for FTP players and I did not want to give them single penny again, they are bad people so game is made for you to BUY stuff for real money, battle pass and all those special skins, characters are boring, gameplay has turn to grind with all the ""good"" people that have found a way to use hacks and trainers to have god mode or one hit K.O. or infinite energy so if you want game that is good, fun and interesting this is not it now most of you like the game and it dose have some positive stuff but those things are minimal compare to bullshit that is happening with this ""game"""
13413,very good game
13414,padalins
13415,I can't get a kill
13416,"So I own the better version, but my cheap ass friends can't allow themselves to pay 20 euro for it, so I get to play this game with them in monthly intervals, ""yay"";
Out of game it's a mess, no idea what's going on after so many years, there are champions that are clearly stronger than others, every time you finish a game it's shoving purchasing in your face (which is to be expected from a free to play I suppose.
I try to play alone occasionally, it's awful, the afks are constant because it's easier to leave a game than face the dodge penalty.
The loading screen pre-game is the uglyest I've ever seen, allowing people to pay to make it look as bad as possible, the name on the red team is impossible to read without squinting your eyes.
All in all, it's ugly, unbalanced, and money grubbing"
13417,"Good game, especially with friends.
My wallet cries tough."
13418,"Most fun I've had playing hero shooters in a while, each hero has his/her own unique quirk and mechanics that makes them deep. However everything isn't rosy as it might seem.

The first and foremost criticism I would make is the rubber-banding, anyone playing from the middle-easts will have random disconnects, bullets not hitting despite being on target, getting shot at despite being behind cover. This all comes down to ping and loss. I sincerely hope they use their funds to launch a middle east server. This game is a gem, it deserves better.

Another criticism I have is the way they monetize their game, I'm fine with paying for new characters or buying gold or deluxe edition to unlock the large roster of characters. But, what I can't stand is the way they sell skins, their must be way they can make it bit more cheaper 100USD for 20 chest is a bit too steep of a price for me personally. Especially when you consider the fact that as I mentioned before we don't even have servers in our local region. 

The bounty coin system god please just make the skins a static price, it's so annoying having to farm coins only to get shafted because you were at work when your favourite  character skin pops up, only to later find out its worth 4000 COINS!!!!! come on now your already drip feeding us the coins while releasing new skins every month. Please just make weekly offerings with fixed price.

Other than that most people complain about community being toxic, but come on which community doesn't have their fair share of salt shakers?"

13437,"The matchmaking is a real killjoy at times, otherwise a really fun! 7/10"
13438,"Fun champion pvp shooter.  The players are friendly and have a good attitude even with losing. No one seems to take this to seriously nor plays it like a job. Even the streamers seem to be mellow and non toxic while playing.  Overall the skins and emotes that are for sale have enough variety to justify the price. Some champions get more variety than others. Not of fan of the loot crate style & would prefer to be able to buy what I want with money and not just roll for a chance at something and then end up getting something Ill never use. 

The battle pass system could use some work but purchasing it is not required to play nor have a good time. 

I have not done any of the rank play so un sure if it differs from the rest of the game play."

If you live in EU or NA, it's likely you won't be able to play due to a glitch (that has existed for months and the devs simply don't care) that disconnects you and prevents you from playing for THREE HOURS. This game is fun, but I can't recommend it to others, unfortunately."

13466,"Literally one of the greatest competitive games of all time. Pouring over cards, abilities, and strategies for long periods of time and then winning matches because of your builds and ideas is super satisfying. I'm the type of person that doesn't play one game for too too long before moving on to the next, but Paladins has always kept my interest due to the infinite possibilities in combinations and team tactics that goes on. Not to mention, meme builds are fun every now and again too! Healer Skye? lol, sure. Five-tank team? Let's doooo ittt!! There are so many ways to enjoy yourself here. If simplicity is more your style, there are presets, but you definitely won't be getting the full experience. All of this wrapped up in a vibrant and lore-rich fantasy world makes for an addicting game to play for years. It's worth a shot. I mean hey, if you just wanna dip your toes in... that's free! So what do you have to lose?"

13509,mpkmn
13510,"Honestly, it just feels like a less polished Overwatch. Which is saying something. Hi-Rez keeps releasing new champions every few months instead of balancing out older champions. It's really frustrating, and makes the game feel like it's in constant beta. You say all day until you're blue in the face how it's not like Overwatch, and how it's a FPSMOBA with each character having their own unique play styles, but really, that doesn't make it better. You get locked into certain ways of playing, because playing any other way just isn't viable, Sound familiar?

So if you didn't like the state Overwatch was/is in, I would not recommend this game. Even though it's free, the frustration takes it's toll.

Update: Spent some more time playing some time after making this review. Everything I've said still applies.

Update 2: Due to the balancing (or lack of balancing), this game is being dominated by a very overpowered champion. Hi-Rez/EvilMojo aren't doing anything, nor are they planning on doing anything about it. I once again do not recommend this game. It's now frustrating beyond just my earlier points."
13511,"All i can say is
If you wanna play a hero shooter and you like ability customization and the fact that you don't care about ranks and the whole ""i'm the best"" stuff, then i can gladly say this is the game for you.
Sure its a bugfest
It might be in the future as well but they aren't intrusive enough to make it frustrating to play (the matchmaking and op characters do that just fine). The developers do care about the game and are working toward making it better, there might be decisions that may be frowned upon just like in the past, but the game still has something that makes me keep playing (call it an abusive relationship if you must).
So before reading reviews, watching frustrating gameplays, and bug compilations i'd suggest you give it a try and have your own opinion.

Overall this game is a solid 9/10 for me.


P.S English isn't my first language so there might be mistakes that i might not know of."
13512,"Very boring after a few matches, the matches are also really short (like 5-8 min)"
13513,"decent game, every character is like a white canvas: you can do anything with them and play them however you want. overall, 7/10 experience"
13514,"I put 260hrs into this game at first 3 or 4 years ago and it was fun at first until I lost interest. I mean, it is an okay game, but the community is super toxic, the game is bugged, and I did not find it as fun anymore I guess. :/"
13515,"The game is amazing
"
13516,.
13517,"Daily quest is bugged. I'm not getting any credit even if I do what was stated. 
First time playing this game and so far, I enjoyed it."
13518,"I've probably put in over 400 hours into this game playing on Xbox One and PC. Game was fun to play at first, but I quickly learned how toxic the community is for this game.  I always run as tank or support, because you know people always instant lock damage or flank. You could do over 200k heals in a game and still have people say to report you for horrible heals when they picked the pink cat girl and they were on the other side of the map jumping around by themselves, or you could be a tank and have people call you trash when no one else picked support to heal you on point.

  Devs don't care about fixing servers, which isn't bad compared to Respawn's Apex Legends' servers that run on a poor overworked hamster. Balance is a huge issue in this game with both gameplay wise and multiplayer wise. Gameplay wise there are some broken ass characters in this game that they haven't nerfed and others that need a major buff that they never gotten.  Multiplayer wise, you could be put in a team that stomps the other team for a couple of matches, then have a switcheroo pulled on you; making you to be on the receiving end without lube.

 Updated Review* Looks like Devs are starting to care about this game now. I'm gonna be switching my review from negative to positive, but most of my old comments from the old review still stand.

"
13564,"I'm a fan of this game, it plays well and almost anyone can pick it up and have an overall good time. Characters are well designed and so far I haven't had any big problems with this game or encountered any bugs. This doesn't mean it's without flaw though. I do think that the game can be a little too easy at times, and that should be saying something because I main a healer. I manged to get a 50 streak, which is unheard of for me, as I'm predominantly bad at FPS games. Other times, it can be pretty challenging, which is something you want in a game like this. I hope that mew players like me could be faced with more challenge in order to help us learn how to utilize our champions abilities better. There's also the problem with the chests in this game, which gives you a chance to get the item(s) you want from it. I could see people getting addicted to spending money just to unlock everything from these chests. Thank god they're only cosmetics, because that means you don't have anything Important or overpowered locked behind a crippling gambling addiction. Overall, my second complaint can be overlooked. This is still an excellent game and I hope it improves over time."

13566,Udyr moment
13567,VERY FUN AND A POGGERS GAME!!!
13568,"amazing
"
13569,it was fun
13570,"First of all this game is really fun, you should try it, and yes even though it has been through a lot of bad phases, it still has been a fun game for most of it. It still has the usual problems of bugs and unbalance matchmaking, but it still is a really fun hero shooter with less emphasis on the shooter aspect for the most part, unlike Mr Overwatch. 

Now Paladins is way more fun than Overwatch in my opinion, the main reason being that paladins is way more free in what you can do and pick as a team, unlike the counter or mirror formula in overwatch. I mean the main way to play the game is to queue for specific roles, like jesus just remove all the heroes except dmg and make a Valorant game.

Point being, Paladins is fun, and gives you quite the freedom on how to play your champ and team. If you dont mind the usual free to player and mostly quiet coms and chat, you will like paladins. If you want to continue to play paladins you will have to deal with the matchmaking system as well as the weird bugs, but that is if you sink some time in paladins."
13571,Just like Overwatch
13572,"Love this game all around. I feel it's way funner than it's counterpart Overwatch and gives the player and actual opportunity to get good! If you like sci-fi shooters, then in my opinion, this is the best one out there! Super fun and my go to game most of the time after work! (:"

13590,good game
13591,"I played Paladins for the first time 4 years ago because of a game called Overwatch, and while I liked it, Overwatch always overshadowed it for me and many others. Paladins was always the easiest game to make fun of, however I think it's reputation is undeserved because while Overwatch was always more popular, I think that Paladins is a better game in many ways.

Paladins' card system creates a amount of replayability and creativity that I haven't seen in many other games like it. It's extremely fun to create your own setups or use other's ideas to use a character in a way that they weren't originally intended for while still being useful. Many characters that I wouldn't normally like by themselves have cards that can fix the things I don't like and create an enjoyable experience that would be impossible in many other games.
The balance in this game is impressive for the amount of characters and the aforementioned customization,
any character can be useful and in most situations skill and strategy is the only determiner of winning, of course there are a couple outliers but this is expected in a game with as many possibilities as this.

I find it hard to take Paladins seriously as a competitive game, which shouldn't deteriorate from it's quality as it can very much be a competent competitive game, however that is not the role that Paladins fulfills in my library. Paladins isn't a game to be taken seriously for me, but one that brings child-like joy of creativity the likes of which I haven't experienced in a while.

In the end, Paladins is one of the funnest experiences I have had in a while and playing with friends only enhances the experience. I regret my former distaste for the game and can only recommend it to anyone who reads this review."

13599,I dont remember a single thing about this game after 3 years
13600,How to fix the loading vendor bug: Click on library > right click on paladins > click on uninstall > and click on the blue button
13601,its ok
13602,They nerfed Maeve
13603,"I have soaked over 200 hours across multiple accounts on pc and even more on console into Paladins and I can tell you that this is a great game weather you are someone who plays casually or competitively. Paladins has a handful of different modes, although the most popular is Siege so I will be using that for this review. In this case, Paladins is a 5v5 team based FPS with a huge cast of characters from a little winter witch, Evie, to a death defying god-like axe-wielding destroyer of anything containing life, Terminus. In this game skill most definitely tells a part in the motion of the game, although teamwork is key. In this game you can honestly feel hours in the training area just playing around with different characters finding out who you want to unlock and it wont be boring. One of the things that I love about this game is the cards. If you don't think that a cast of more than 30 characters was enough, you won't be disappointed, you can play the same character in so many different ways because of the deck loadouts that you use, this feature adds a sense of personalization into the mix because you can play the character the way you want to play them. Want more health then why didn't you say so, BOOM more health. Want shorter recharge time on your abilities, okay here you go. There is so much you can do to simply tweak how your chosen champion works and it really does have its advantages because I have loved soaking many hours into creating the perfect builds for me and I enjoyed every single bit of it!"

13636,"People call it an Overwatch clone, but it's just a hero shooter, I feel like Paladins provides Heroes rather than roles, in Overwatch, a hero has one purpose, in Paladins, heroes have playstyles."
13637,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."
13638,Its Ok
13639,CHANGES SO OFTEN bad meta
13640,Overwatch but good
13641,"How do I put this; This game has and had the potential to be good, but with the way the hitboxes work (for those of you who don't know, they're pill-shaped, meaning everything is much more larger than it needs to be), and the way matchmaking seems to constantly be an algorithm of ""Matching you with two games in a row where you steam roll the team, matching you two games in a row where you're steamrolled,"" piled ontop of the inconsistent and oftenly OP champions against the inability to change champions in game, and you get the issue with Paladins; a game that seemingly wants to be about skill, while never feeling like it's about skill at all as much as it is just a luck of the draw you have limited hand in. 

I want this game to succeed, as fuck Blizzard and fuck Overwatch is one of my key viewpoints, but this isn't a worthy alternative, as it manages to suffer from the same issues as Overwatch while being unsatisfying to play."

13643,Secretly Good

dont believe me? koga 1v1 rn"
13647,Just try it and you'll loves it
13648,Was skeptical about this game due to the constant comparison to Overwatch. Only played it for a bit and I'm already invested. Fun game with friends!
13649,fre overwatk ecks de!
13650,Yooo so like no cap this game is worth it like come on now it's literally $0 what you funna do if you don't like it refund it? Nawww jit just delete it. But I will say you can play as Vora and she reminds me of my cyperpunk character (not really) and I like playing as her (mostly cuz they girls) you can also play as my dawg Zhin who I think is Zoro (from one piece) but with only one sword style and his ult reminds me of itoru shi shi son son lai.

13652,"Used to love this game a few years ago even though everyone said it was an OW ripoff. I had really high hopes it would get better in 2020/2021/2022 while OW content was dry, but it really hasn't. They put 85% of effort into skins, 5% into balancing, and the last 10% into the new characters every season. Really fun, but will never be a good longterm game due to core gameplay issues and a tarnished reputation. Again, I was a huge fan for a long time and really wanted it to succeed but it's time for me to face reality and say it's never going to get better. Fun to play with friends, but do not take it seriously under any circumstances."

13655,The Overwatch your mum says you already have at home.
13656,"This game is just Overwatch but somehow worse. At least with Overwatch you don't have to get credits to unlock characters. Credits that you of course can buy with real money instead of taking the insanely long amount of time that it takes to get enough to buy any character worth while. If you're going in on a ftp account you're gonna have a bad time, cause other players will have characters that are just generally better in almost every way, and there won't be anything you can do about it except lose nearly every game for 60 hours"

In-game you don't just have 1 set of abilities and stick to them, you can choose to set up YOUR own load out that's customized to YOUR gameplay. You even have an in-game items shop."

compare to other loot box in other game:
- have narrowed selection inside.(some contain 10 to 200 inside depending what box you look at)
- some gets discount at times
- will not get duplicates to prevent any gambling.(you can stop until you get what you want)
- you wont be able to buy it when you already have all of it in the specific box.

13805,"The game has been out for so many years, but has failed to fix even basic issues - after deciding to return to Paladins, being stuck at 'Completing Login' for an hour, after resetting things, unlinking/relinking my account, verifying game files etc, it still continues to be an issue. 

Many people have mentioned these problems over several years and none of them offer any solutions, showing that even now they haven't put any effort into fixing it. This says a lot about the team behind the game. Guess Hi-Rez doesn't want me to play, which is fine by me."

13812,eeeh not bad
13813,"awesome game lots of fun even when things are not going well
"
13814,The most horrendous matchmaking I've seen by far in a videogame. Fix your game developers.
13815,"I can only recommend it to casual players but there are still better titles.

Community is horrible, tickrate is 20ish even on rankeds (which means you often get killed after hiding behind a wall or jumping away) so annoying for everyone but unplayable for assassins.
Some cards don't do anything like IO's increased Moonlight. Her moonlight regeneration, spending and recovery work on % values and cards give her flat value.

Game likes to disconnect you at random and you aren't always able to connect back. On top of that you are replaced by horrible BOT and no one is notified that it's BOT playing or that you left. It implies that they know about that problem and trying to hide it with disingenuous abomination of a workaround.

There's plenty more little bugs like chat filter that you cannot turn off that censores everything. Like when you type to someone who plays character Cassie they see C***ie.

At least you cannot boost yourself with real money spending but that's a low bar."
13816,Used to be one of the best games there is in its category. But recently it crash more than it run not only that it also have some crazy bugs. For example Vatu which is a new champion has a bug which allows him to enter the other team base. If the game crashed and you restart it it give you a penalty for being deserter. Some time it doesn't even allow you to open the market or choose your talent. My favorit bug is when you win the game in ranked and it does even show at all. some times in the middle of game ranked or casual the game out if its own goes to the main menu and you are out of the game.

13870,its cool
13871,"I enjoyed playing Paladins last year (2020) But coming back this year (2021) feels like its a dead game, a 17 minute queue for ranked is not a thing for a (active) game, if you cannot afford overwatch then surely do not play this hot pile of a mess, save up and play something else or just buy overwatch in the end, paladins went from a awesome good game to a puddle of shit with p2w shitzu features.

PROS:
- A game if you're bored.
- Cool card deck builds.
- Free version of overwatch.

CONS:
- Devs dont care.
- P2W might aswell play BDO (Black Desert Online)
- Queue times (15+ Minutes for ranked)
- At this point its a dead game.
- Shitty version of overwatch."
13872,fun game

13880,"WOW
"
13881,"Nice game enjoyable
"
13882,"I always come back to this game and i enjoy it at first but it always happens that i quit after awhile. Not because it's not fun or too hard etc. There is literally one reason and one reason only......Flankers. Having a role that is made up of characters who sneak around and kill key targets is fine... in theory. Especially in a team game where you can work together and focus them down but NO ONE TALKS OR COMMUNICATES!! 

Now this isn't something I really care about because in all my years of playing games i know 95% of people don't talk in team games. The problem is I would expect developers to understand this also. You see a Buck (Flanker) better run or have teammates with you because he is jumping onto without consent and shoving that shotgun in your mouth. See a Skye (Flanker) (jk she's invisible) prepare to get shot with Covid and then filled with bullet holes as the cure. See a cat lady with pink hair bouncy 20ft in the air constantly? Uninstall because that is the only way you survive.

Every other ""Role"" in the game is honest in what they do. Tanks usually have shields and are beefy. Damagers usually hit from medium to long range and you can usually see them coming. Healers...heal(fuck Furia). Flankers on the other hand I have to pray they are garbage at the game or just run away and hope that their bloodlust is turned to another one of my teammates. I usually fill in games because i enjoying playing a bunch of characters and making sure we (the team) has all the tools to win. That's why I don't just say fuck it and play a flanker. It's boring when I can just hop on Skye and easily get 20+ kills almost every game and i'm not even that good. All in all play Tetris or something.

Also my girlfriend is getting scared of me because I keep smashing my desk and yelling."
13883,I played this before I started playing Overwatch and never came back... But I had a fun time so enjoy a good review~
13884,its a great game

13901,"I recently delved back into Paladins after taking a while off. (I think 2019 was my last go at it, I enjoyed it then.)

I've already reached the ceiling of gameplay that I care to reach. What in the everlasting f*** happened to the seasonal reward system? I paid 10 dollars for the new season in May the actual day-of starting, and found NO reason to stay. 

Season progression went from 80 or 90 levels to, like 25, meaning that you stay the same level for MUCH longer and the rewards for each rank progression are dogsh**. (SOOOOOO MANYYYYYY WALL-SPRAYYYY COSMETICSSSS) Seriously if anything has become stale in this game, it's the rewards.

All of these aspects were taken away to promote their new Limited Time Modes, also known as ""The typical online game Battle-Pass way to get you to spend much more time logged for the same rewards, using gameplay modes that are a slog to get thru."" Each LTM has a locked reward that you cannot access until each of the 3 LTM events are complete. The catch? LTM events are released in sets of 3, once per week. Instead of grinding out the (arguably cool) rewards that we were once given a path to, we now have to play in bits and pieces, and make sure we log in more often, and make sure we stay on top of the ""weekly timed events."" (Good Christ, it's sooooo ""Battle-Pass"" dynamics and marketing)

Sorry guys. I miss actually playing thru the Season and earning all the sick skins you used to offer. (*and enough GEMS to buy the next season, ensuring that you stay and keep playing another few months. Now you guys just offer sprays, emotes, and chests (That are heavily sleighted towards emotes and sprays.)

Matchmaking is still a WILD potluck of new players VS seasoned vets with zero communication. Ranked Paladins is also among the most toxic MOBA environment out there.

It was fun while it lasted guys. This game used to feel much more balanced and worth my time. Now it's just another FTP MOBA Cash-Pumping machine."
13902,One of the easy games but fun at the same time. I would recommend this game to anyone. There is no pressure to be a god at the game and there are so many positions that you can play in game that suits you. Overall I guarantee you will have so fun moments with this game. :)

13915,"This is the only game I actually play religiously, jump in for a few quick games then leave.

Pros:
- It has been going through a lot of improvement, and definitely worth a try since it's free anyway. 
- Paladins allows players to customize every champion skill/talents/loadouts which is the most unique aspect of this game comparing to Overwatch

Cons:
- Definitely still need a lot of work done for more custom rooms and stable servers. 
- No more kill-cam, no more play of the game, not a lot of game modes/events like before

But most important of all, REGROUP, REGROUP, NEED HEALING!!, NEED HEALING!!"

13922,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

13973,"though low hours I can judge based on mechanics and game build in how it feels.

Your real matches are a mixed bag of good equal fights or team of starters vs high rank veterans stomping on players.

There is no match making via levels or so from what I've noticed. So prepare for many frustrating matches where you cannot even kill anyone. So you get spawn camped to death by 1 dps. The infamous Terminus vet with 2 healers vets makes him unkillable as new players never listen to Dont shoot him when hes absorbing. 

biggest fun killer, is if you accidentally pick a healer than dps, you cannot change. So not like other FPS types and can quickly kill the fun and variety especially if struggling. This pretty much kills the match as one extra tank or healer spells doom to a match. Yet dps will always be better to destroy shields.

Card system is interesting but best to look at sites that tell you which builds are meta or you will anger team or fail greatly.

Doesn't feel rewarding much even with gold coins/gems to unlock new players it will take forever but nothing much else to use it on. The new get new points to buy limited edition skins up for small amount of time is only for vets. You will never have enough in time but they give so few it'll be a mind numbing grind.

Many maps are not really well built, adding to confusion to new players with so many multiple paths or dead ends. It feels really cluttered at times due to some maps just being too enclosed with many exits and entrances.

compared to TF2, with class types, Overwatch it really doesnt feel so good to play or fun in long run.

Does have a nice leveling that must be reached for a number of characters before heading into ranked. Bad part is if you're a new and free player you get the cheaper builds that often arent good to use in matches. So heads up on team builds."

It is like Overwatch but the main difference being in Paladins you create loadouts on multiple levels to play a Champion the way that suits you. 3 people can play a champion unique to their style due to this. In my opinion, this is what makes is better than Overwatch."

14036,yes
14037,"Highly enjoyable to play with friends! Solo time is enjoyable, but obviously you lack the swaths of support from friends so there's a much lesser chance of victory in PVP. Stick to co-op vs, AI modes if you prefer to vibe by yourself. I recommend doing PVP with friends as you have to be ready for people who are quick to snipe or flank you, having shotcallers helps a lot too. there's extra content that can be purchased if you want certain aesthetics, i suggest unlocking all characters at least so that you have options from the start. the roster is pretty diverse, and most of the supports have heavy DPS (a huge plus compared to Overwatch's roster) Think TF2 but with better character designs (sorry i'm biased lmao)"

14057,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."
14058,"This game is very nice if you don't have the money to spend on the original game. I would recommend this because it is basically the same thing and it is really fun to play with other people and friends. You also have a tonne of champions to choose from which improves the game quality! I would probably give this game an 8/10. I would've gave it 10/10 if the game had some kind of challenges to earn more coins. at the moment, you have to grind a lot and play a lot of games to earn a small amount of coins. If they would add this to the game it would make this game perfect."

14081,"Pros: 
Fun with friends
Character customization for various builds
Many differing types of game play to choose from
Active dev team
Free to play with in store cosmetics only
Generally casual enough to hop on and enjoy whenever

Khans
Sometimes unstable servers
Less than desirable match making
Poor champion balancing
focus on new champs rather than game improvements
slow to fix bugs
60/40 on having a toxic community
prefer to nerf champs into the ground rather than rework or adjust their respective rivals 
current meta steering away from frontlines who are already the least chosen class of champs
watchable ads in game for a small amount of gold which is used for very little
removal of past enjoyable features such as kill cam and play of the game

Summary: A rough gem that can be enjoyable with friends and has its moments, but has a lot going against it, and without people to join I would not recommend for newer players."

14100,;
14101,"Paladins... this game has had questionable decisions made around it leading to some really bad eras of the game, but honestly recently things have been going in a great path for the game and I only hope for its success in the future and for them to continue making this a good game, because at its core it is a pretty fun game! So why play Paladins over Overwatch and other hero shooters? The characters kits are honestly all pretty fun to use. I've achieved a decent level of mastery with nearly every character because I find 90% of them to be really enjoyable, with all having some skill expression (varying amounts as expected), and very satisfying, fluid abilities that should supply a lot of fun. Now I will admit most of the characters kits are a bit simple so some may lack the complexity some look for, but luckily there are still a good few characters that can fit your bill. I honestly overall enjoy these kits a lot more than the characters of Overwatch for the aforementioned reasons. Now maps can be a hit or miss, I feel this is a common problem with hero shooters with a large variety of maps, some of them just suck. They can be designed in such a way where there's a really select few picks that are good on the map that just dominate which can lead to some pretty aggravating games if their team gets the power picks, but I will say from a casual point of view most of the maps feel good to run around in and have fun. Gamemodes for Paladins leave a lot to be desired as there's only three two of them being a capture type and then a team deathmatch. The devs have said they're finally going to be adding/re-adding more in like a Payload type one so that should be something to look forward to. Next in line is balance of the game, it's... alright. Some updates can be annoying with a few characters being overtly stronger than everyone else and some being terrible for too long since the biggest complaint I have with this game is that the devs take a ton of time to balance characters due to them wanting to keep an eye on things for about 3 months before doing anything to get the best idea possible on where to balance, but then they usually miss the mark on nerfs, the buffs are usually good though! For our final review point let's look at the most important the skins. Pretty good overall, they've gotten a lot better recently, I've spent some money sadly on them. Overall a very fun game I'd say a better casual experience than competitive. Try it out it's free you lose nothing for trying it. Also the characters are cooler and more interesting than Overwatch characters and nothing can change my mind, thank you <3"

14118,Azaan kontol
14119,Although I still think the game is better than overwatch from a gameplay perspective the removal of 3rd person view in all game modes after coming back to the game made all the skins that I paid for completely worthless and pointless to use so a lot regret for any money I spent on the game and now there's no reason to spend money on the game and makes me wonder how long the game will last with their only income being skins that the people who buy them can't see and that's why I can't recommend it tho this opinion comes from someone who only gave the game chance due to it having 3rd person view I'm not saying imma out right quit the game for good cause I was never bothered that ranked/competitive play was 1st person only and I still like it over overwatch but I know I'll never spend money on the game again until they add a 3rd person game mode or re add 3rd person to casual play to see the skins I bought and/or would buy since there's no point and that was why I bought skins in the first place.
14120,"Free, free, free"

14132,"AMAZING,FUN,NOT A WASTE OF MONEY AT ALL."

"
14135,"Yes, good game, very fun"
14136,"played this on and off for about four years and theres still the same amount of bugs and shit/afk players that make me want to blow my brains out. that being said i love this game, i love the character design and i miss top plays dearly.

14137,"My dire wolf Tyra skin disappeared from my account a week ago. I sent them a ticket and after a week, today they replied and told me that I never opened that skin in my account. Been using that skin since last year. I have the Russian Tyra skin and also the cowboy themed skin form battle pass but still I have been using the dire wolf skin cause I liked the green fire from her Molotov. These people are trying to make me believe that that hundreds of matches I played with that skin was all a dream."

14143,this game is really fun but i cant download it and I've followed every tutorial none of them mention my problem this game told me what to do and it worked but i uninstalled it and now it never tells me what to do so i cant download it if you have any suggestions or know what the game tells you to do ive allowed comments so comment what to do please. It also crashes frequently but you can always get back in to the game but i suggest playing this game on any other console like switch for example is fantastic it loads quicklyand kit works rather smoothly.

14152,wow such fon game i wud recomend to avrage vewer to down this game plz i ned sume frend to play thus game wuth
14153,is gut
14154,0 team comp or cooperation but it's worth playing if u can't play overwatch
14155,"Pros
1 Actually decent combat systems in play (look, it's overwatch but it's free, deal with it.)
2 Still has a decent sized player base. Regular matches are not really a problem
3 Free
4 Nice variety of heros
Cons
1 Even with a good connection, you might have a crap connection. They need to look into some better servers.
2 Despite the large variety, the amount of play time you have to grind to unlock new heros is a bit ridiculous. very clearly encourages you to buy the champions instead, or the passes.
3 like any game of this sort, playing solo can either be amazing or frustrating. bring a friend or three.

Gameplay is solid enough to make this game worth playing if you don't mind the repetitive arena combat. It's free and if you feel like supporting the developer, there is plenty of stuff you can buy (I wouldn't unless you plan to dedicate a looooot of time to this game.) 

Overall, i'd say a 6.5/10, above average."
14156,Chokeslammed by half the enemy team and still only died to the enemy Lian.
14157,"Awesome. Sure, there are bugs here and there, but absolutely fun. Like any other multiplayer games like DOTA or Overwatch, you will get frustrated when you ranked.

Some people say its a free version of Overwatch. While characters may look very similar to Overwatch, the gameplay & mechanics are drastically different once you've played both games. 
The card & item system is the game very versatile and very different to Overwatch in terms of play style. You can pick up a support, make a card loadout that benefits it for DPS and wreck people. You can pick up a tank, make a loadout and flank the hell out of people."

14210,"A very nice game to play with your friends. Encouraging teamworks, communication, planning and tactical (not at the same level of R6 though)

The only problem for me:
-  too much skins for the same characters all over again.
- Ranked match took quite a long time to get a match

The rest is exciting and can give adrenaline surge to your brain. Especially in the last round with superb music :D"

14226,"First off, this game is free so can't complain too much. But even so this game is a lot of fun. It's not perfect, there's definitely been some balance issues pertaining to both levels and champions, and some of the game modes they've tried to introduce have fallen flat. But if you are looking for a fun alternative to Overwatch, this game can be a blast both single player or with friends. Also no pay to win which is a plus for a free game."

14289,"I won't recommend this game. If you are new to hero shooter, you may like this game at the beginning and gradually let it go in few months or so. If you are from other hero shooters like overwatch or apex, you are most likely to leave the game in the beginning itself  . This game is unbalanced, some characters are too op and some are forgotten that they even exist. The game is dying and they are dragging it from the past 2 years just by releasing new skins. For every patch with new skins they release new bugs too. 
This game doesn't have new players, atleast in sea servers. Trust me I have 2300 hours of gameplay and almost 50% of the time I have played with the same opponents."

14302,"very nice fast paced team based game,"
14303,"If you don't have a good graphics card (like me), I wouldn't recommend this at all. You'll just lag the whole time even with all graphics settings on low. Until they add a particle limit slider then I'm keeping this review negative. This is the only game I have issues with. I can have all settings on very high - high and be fine, but once particles show up I lag like crazy. Some maps seem to cause it as well, so it's a map/champion combo sometimes which makes it even worse. Idk how much longer we have to ask for something like this until it's finally put in game."

14305,is goo game. some junkiness here and there but is all goo is all part of the fun
14306,fun
14307,"Though yes it is fairly buggy, and new heroes are never balanced, its a good game. Lots of fun to pick up and play casually, though i dont personally believe this game is a very good game competitively due to the lack of hero balance."

14350,"I do quite like it. Especially how diverse it is, you can change how you play each champion. I have seen worse toxic games aswell. But, the game frequently adds new champions and skins while it should focus more on bug fixes. It is understandable they want to keep people interested, but that would work better with a proper working game. Matchmaking is fine for me. Also quite unique designs and ideas."

14386,game doesn't load passed the EAC launcher popup screen. It works on my laptop as a first time install. But it won't work on a computer that has it uninstalled already.

14396,"A perfect blend of MOBA and FPS.
Many compare this game to Overwatch and yes they have their similarities. However Paladins throws OW out of the water by having tons of customizable features for your charactors to give you an extra edge over your opponents over the straight and linear FPS-ability. This is a game I will play again and again, which is why I already have over 20 hours under my belt in 3 days... To me, the game is really that great if you can accept her quarks. If you like Smite, than you will very much love Paladins also."
14397,"Whatever you do, don't play when tiagocarrrlhas is on your team; the true paladins experience is completely ruined; foiled one might say.
This souless husk of a human has to audacity to go and take a dump in the middle on MY ranked game.
This sorry excuse for a child tickler somehow manage to place BRONZE IV (4); The second lowest rank in the game after 5 placement matches.
All this isn't even the worse part, You see, this makoa 1 trick always finds a way to blame his teammates for his poor decisions.
Oh, and don't even get me started on this guy's Ying."
14398,"Happy to be back again.

Still love this game over than Overwatch. <3 

10/10 But....Bugging my Pc"
14399,"It's a really fun game - if you think it's 'just a copy of Overwatch' and for that reason alone you don't play it; then you're missing out on probably one of the funnest games there is. They have a very wide selection of Champions that vary in difficulty - so you can pick up one of the easier Champs and be pretty good right away. Depending on which play-style you like, you can choose to be the Frontline (basically the Tank of the team, they soak up most of the damage, and are meant to be constantly trying to stay on the point), the Flanker (they flank, pretty simple), the Damage (they're the main line of offence - they're the guys that are usually trying to take down the Frontline), and finally the Support (you heal people, again pretty simple) a lot of the Champions can actually act as hybrids between roles - allowing for you to change up you strategies accordingly. 

The Community, however... can be rather toxic at times - but then again, that's always gonna happen."

14465,"played this game for a long time seen the consol side and pc side and can say by a game and community standpoint it's pretty terrible. no one budges on their pick in any game mode, you get toxic messages for playing what you want, or for trying to fill the one of three roles that are missing in the team. can't in good spirits tell my friends to play this game"
14466,Fun game

Only redeeming quality about the game is the community is much less toxic than Overwatch, play it with friends for as long as you can, then throw it in the trash and never look back."
14491,good game :)
14492,"Download it, play it for 3 hours and then never touch it again cause that 3 hours is the most amount of fun youre going to have in this game.
its incredibly unbalanced and with no role lock everyone insta locks dps and then flops
I dont know how people call this ""better overwatch"" its soo nuch worse
after 12 hours of playing i ended with 29 losses and 19 wins, overwatch would atleast give me a 50% W-L
and dont bother saying ""uuh youre just trash"" i am not when i come first or second place on my team with elims and damage on tank

What needs to be changed in my eyes:
Either remove Support or nerf the support heros damage
NERF THE FUCK OUT OF MAEVE, there is no need for her basic attack to do 800DMG/s.
Remove some of the verticallity of some characters to make them easier to deal with.
Make characters that have melee weapons actually have to be in melee range to attack not 50 feet away throwing some magic spum at people.

i will say to spend the money on overwatch you get a more balanced game with developers that actively send out character changes and try to make sure the game is balanced and fun"
14493,"good to play for spare times. it's free, why don't you try?"
14494,good
14495,8/10
14496,"This game feels like a beta version. The client is full of bugs, too slow with bad UI. In game it gets even worse with bugs and unbalanced champions. The game has potential but in it's current state I wouldn't recommend it to a new player. Not until the game gets an overall rework."
14497,"love it
"
14498,"You either steamroll or get steamrolled. Characters are uninspired, game balance and flow doesn't exist and the game size is way too big to justify how little there is to do. 

If you want a fun game, play something else. This is only popular because it's free to play."

\"
14518,"all the gross fat bearded nerds who play this game are disgusting and just flat out ruin every aspect of enjoyment you might squeeze out. making this game free is an insult, it should flat out give you money to play. the developers dont know game balance, so instead of nerfing characters they just add more, not fixing the initial problem. if youre skilled at aiming youre now gonna be average because the hitboxes in this game are awful, flattering the skilless, punishing the skilled. the stuns in this game are unreal, some characters could just do more damage while youre stunned. you can never solo carry because, unlike other team based games, you have to sorta rely on your teammates. overall good game 8.5/10 :)"
14519,it s sooooooooo bad that it is good
14520,"I like the game but I'm not a fan of the new game pass system. I much preferred the battle pass way. I also think some characters like Skye are way to overpowered, I played as her once and got almost 30 kills. This is consistent with all my friends who have played as Skye. With some balancing this game has so much potential but as it stands I don't play this game as much as I used to.

Update: I recently went back to this game and it seems most of my cons were addressed and the game is fun again!"
14521,good game fun and easy to play
14522,"This game is fun and there's lots of ways to play but one thing that i don't like about this game is when you spawn the enemy team can camp outside your spawn so when you spawn and walk out there right there in front to kill you.

14527,yes very good team game with 4 random retards
14528,"Idk. Like 2 years of this game telling me I got 16-32 ping, but all my abilities have like a 2-3 second delay, & acting like I have 300-3,000 ping. Not every single match, sure you get the occasional good match where there is no issues, but that's about 2 out of 10 matches. Fun game, but with the straight :pooooooop: tier servers, I just can't recommend because of that. 



The sad part is I'm probably gonna keep playing, lmao."

14533,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your game gave me cancer anyway.

"
14547,"Dont bother. 

Cheaters, drophackers, smurfs and trolls that intentionaly ruin your ranked games by either AFKing at spawn, trollpicking or trashtalking you over the voice chat everywhere.

Hirez dont really bother to ban these, but if you get mad at these players, you get perma banned for ""harassment"". 6-7yo account with 1400 hrs gametime poof. Hundreds of euro invested poof. All over some f-word against people, that break these rules literally every game.

In the last +- half year, there was some change at support staff or process, so ban-policy now got woke like netflix. You can drophack, you can leave midgame ranked repeatedly, you can troll however you want and you will be fine, but if you ever say any ""no-no word"" in chat, you get perma banned.

I wonder, if any support ctrl+c/ctrl+v reply-bots... sorry, i mean hi-rez staff ever played their own game (solo ranked queue) without their dev-checkmarks next to their name to get reality-check about how players been treating each other in competetive online ranked game past 6 years."

je sais qu'il y a des coût a payer aussi pour la maintenance du jeux mais en tout cas bon courage continuée comme ça. et surtout ajouter plus de champion j'aime bien vos idées et concept"

14551,It's alright.
14552,Really Good And Fun It Is An OverWatch Knock Off But It IS Still Fun And Creative
14553,"A very easy and accessible free-to-play game. A decent change of pace from other team based games that I'm used to.
The starter champions that they give you are all fairly good in their own right and they throw enough gold at you for you to be able to quickly purchase several new ones.

It's far more generous than any other f2p game I've touched, the issue is that it has ""true dailies"" over daily quests that stack up, so not playing every day can lead to a lot of lost gold."

14574,This game is amazing. There is a champion for everyone to get attached to and a champion for all types of players. I recommend this game for ppl who like fast paced games but around 1-20 minute durations. I used to play on xbox and had over 50 hours played. I love this game!!!
14575,Better than current Overwatch. Lacks the porn tho.
14576,Good game. Fun characters. But one drawback its a grind to unlock new characters.

14578,"Very interesting game with lots of different strategies and enjoyable characters.  It's a lil' daunting to get into at first but once I did I was pretty well hooked (70 hours in 2 weeks hooked).  Very well balanced, despite being mostly multiplayer.  You rarely lose a match and think ""Man, there was nothing we could have done to counter that"", and when you do, it's usually just a matter of lack of team coordination."
14579,this game is good for people who like playing with friends or who just like a team based game

14593,"usually pretty fast paced games. As with any multiple player team, you will find people that are just BAD. But that can't be avoided. What I find better in this MOBA is that there is rarely AFK'ers. Maybe rarely isn't the word, but I don't see it as often as I did in League of Legends. In addition, I rarely see griefers and intentional feeders. This is very refreshing."
14594,Its good
14595,"I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.

Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit ""1"", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.

Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.

DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.

As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.

In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.

It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins."

14607,"No widescreen support because it gives an ""unfair advantage""? Okay buddy, upgraded my monitor and wanted to go back but it appears I won't be after all."
14608,"I played this game on playstation several months ago and then stopped. After picking up the game on PC recently, I am very much enjoying the game on this platform more. It is way more fun and enjoyable now that my partner and I can play it together again. 

Only complaint is their matchmaking system which could use some work when it comes to playing a low level character against someone a numerous levels ahead."
14609,"I have played both Overwatch and Paladins and I can say they look similar but play somewhat differently. Paladins feels more like a MOBA in a FPS setting then a team FPS like Overwatch. What I like about Paladins the most is the loadout system makes every character feel different unique compared to what another player has set up compared to Overwatch where characters have a fixed play style. This game is free to play and while it does have microtransactions it doesnt have anything thatll give players a major advantage its really all cosmetic. On top of it this game has crossplay between Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. And for people who refuse to let go of the controller u can queue with only controllers which is nice. It also has cross progression between Nintendo, Xbox, and for PC but not for PlayStation. I tried with PS4 but it just didnt work I dont know why. Other than that its a fun game u should definitely give it a try since its free :)"
14610,Yea its ok

I played this a ton on xbox 4 years ago, logged in to find I did not retain my Founders package.
It's been 2 weeks fussing with Customer Support trying to get them to give me the package I paid for."
14666,"Overall a decent game. Have played it for some hours, and can say that its basically a free version of Overwatch. If your looking for something like that give it a go. Due to the game being quite fun with friends, and free, I gave it a thumbs up."
14667,v cool if you get teammates who have played a team based game or have touched a keyboard ever
14668,HELL YEAH THIS GAME IS AMAZING
14669,"This game suffers in the shadow of Overwatch, but the most important thing to do if you're thinking about it is to just give it a try. If you're a fan of the fantasy aesthetic this game is a visual treat, and there are so many characters one is bound to fit your play style.

Speaking of characters, I found that trying to unlock them as F2P takes enough time to make you plan ahead, but it is certainly faster than other games with a similar system. If you stick with the game for 30+ hours as a F2P, consider buying the Digital Deluxe Edition on discount for ~£30, as having instant unlocks for all previous [i]and[/i] new characters gives you plenty more content to enjoy. (It also refunds gold spent on characters for use on some nice recolours or other misc things)

The gamemodes are nothing too special, but the fun of the game is definitely in its huge but not overwhelming cast of characters. Despite being initially overwhelmed after being thrown into a game without warning by an experienced friend, characters are incredibly easy to pick up, but take longer to master. The individual Champion levels help you gauge how well someone should be with a character, as that means they've spent time with them specifically, although this doesn't mean they're invincible or make you feel hopeless like when you see an Apex Predator in your Plat-stuck-ass' game.

Daily quests can be completed in Players VS Bot matches, which makes grinding ones that force you to do something you don't like doing much quicker. If you're being stomped game after game it can be relaxing to just play however you want, as whilst the bots aren't the smartest they can still be a challenge when they're ganging up on you.

All in all I think this is a really fun game, and if you're reading this you're obviously thinking about trying it, so just do it!"
14670,nice game. overwatch in Fantasy world with more players
14671,"As someone who has played this game for 30+ hours. I can say that Paladins is a go to option if you want Overwatch, but can't afford it. It's selection of heroes/champions to play is incredibly large and includes a champion for whatever your play style is. As I mentioned before, Paladins' game mechanics are very similar to that of Overwatch. Therefore, if you have ever played or heard of Overwatch, you will easily be able to climb the ranks and become a Paladins pro in no time!"

14724,"Overwatch but more chaotic and fun, i have over 1k hours on OW and i can say that this game is more fun. the card system is great for personalizing to your play style without relying too heavy on ""meta"" like warzone meta, this game is actually fun if you give it a chance. 
the problems i have with this game is the lack of emotes and expressions. the quanitiy of skins is pretty lack luster with almost no way to get said skins for free. you should be able to buy skins with coins since, there is not much to use for coins on a set time.
2nd complain is that the devs wont nerf tyra, shes broken, end of story, i want the balance team to slam her in the ground forever
3rd complaint is that tyra is still a character
the last complaint is the over sexualization of 1 character in a skin, the bomb king love skin is too sexy, its distracting, he is way too handsome to be on the battlefield.

14751,"It's pretty good especially for a free game. They keep it fresh with many new characters and game modes and events, although they've been struggling with keeping a solid idea for the Battle Passes / Event Passes for a while. I also like how you can customize your gameplay with the various abilities and the Item Shop, which is a big change for me since I play Overwatch as well, but I always come back to this. The cosmetics are pretty good (some events are better than others when it comes to skins), and I've put a lot of time and money into this game and I don't regret a thing."

14811,"A great overwatch like fps for free. Decent updates and I like the card system. If anyone reading this is confused about the card system (at least I call it that) it is basically you can assign cards with different bonuses to characters for specific builds. For example when I play as pip I tried using cards that increased me and my teams survivability. And i also play pip sometimes with a card build that puts me on a more attack side of things, seeing as he has great movement. Also I never thought I would see a character where you have to do a reload animation for a sword, imagine someone reloading their sword before they attack you, badass!"

Pros- Fun shooty gun game. Free overwatch essentially.
- great character design 
-tons of champs to choose from, there's something for everyone!
-very consistent updates
Cons- it WILL crash on you. The optimization is poopoo. 
-If you buy the bp you also have to grind. So you pay $15 min for content you then have to painfully grind for while hoping the game doesn't crash on you. 
-theyve added ""direct buy"" skins so now you don't even get all the skins that should be apart of the bp. 
-some of the skins cost $35 (1200 crystals)... yes... $35 in rl money... how tf are they getting away with this? I'm not sure. 
-If you're mains aren't skye, maeve, lian, or androxus don't expect new content for them. Some characters haven't gotten new content in LITERALLY 2+ YEARS... RIP WILLO, MOJI
- Most of the player base is braindead. Front lines ""dont need to be on point"" mentality, support ""dont need to heal"" mentality and flanks ""dont need to flank"" mentality is rampant. Doesn't matter if you're playing casuals or ranked. Equally braindead. 
TL:DR play it ftp, don't invest in their shitty bp and extremely overpriced in game currency"

14830,"change the name to Land of bugs. If you launch the game there is a chance you will stuck at loading profile or loading vendors and you have to restart the game. Lets say you have launched the game successfully and now you joined you friend's lobby, guess what you have a chance that you don't connect to the match which your friends in lobby just joined. Now your friends are in match and you are going to stay in lobby alone. Lets say you found a match so in match either the server is going to be shitty or sometime you will lagg out and you'll be stuck in same position while watching everyone else moving fine. and there is a bug ingame when you shoot or use a ability you attack or the ability will not count. you can move around but you are useless. there are more bugs in the game which i don't want to type.

The developer are focused on cosmetics instead of making there game better they focus on skins."

14865,"It's a very easy game compared to ow/apex/csgo, but skill ceiling is very high. Fun overall."
14866,"[b]Introduction[/b]
Paladins is an awesome game that you can really sink hundreds (or even thousands) of hours into it and it'll never get boring. This game is great for the casual ""gamer"", and if you like other similar titles like Overwatch then you'll enjoy this. 

[b]Casual Play[/b]
My take on this game depends to what extent you want to play it. If you're just playing some quickplay with your friends then this is an awesome choice and there's some cool champions to play as well as some really nice map designs. I actually prefer the champions and maps in this game over Overwatch (and I have a lot of hours in both games, actually even more in Overwatch). 

[b]Ranked Play[/b]
On the other hand if you're a more competitive gamer like myself you'll likely want to hop on this game and dive right into ranked matches and this is where some issues start to arise. 

[b]The issues with ranked[/b]
The matchmaking on this game is very flawed, and likely needs some looking into. It's very easy to jump ranks, and within only about 3 days I was placed in Diamond V. With that said, it almost feels like the rank hardly matters anyway because you can sit for 10 minutes waiting for a ranked game, get put in a game full of Grandmaster / Master players, and then someone dodges the game only to then be placed in another game 2 minutes later with some Silver/Gold players. I assume this is likely Hi-Rez's way of avoiding long queue times, but then you'll almost regret playing anyway because people will pick whatever champions they like even if it means you will almost certainly lose the game (Like 5 DPS).

Another issue is that Paladins is (unfortunately) notorious for it's bad servers. With that said I've only actually had 1 bad server in the last few weeks and I'm in the EU region (but I'm not too sure if other regions have it worse or not). 

Toxicity. Toxicity. Toxicity. The players in the ranked scene on Paladins have probably some of the worst attitudes I've ever seen... and I mean it's likely because it's a free game and if they ever get banned they can just set up a new account and they're good to go again. But if you do play Paladins I hope you have thick skin, or you're okay with blocking people regularly because you should expect that in basically every other game someone will swear at you, shout racist insults, and even go as far as to spam whisper you in your following games the same insults. I should add that I've reported a few people for this and so far one of them was banned for it. However I really had to encounter this same person numerous times and report them each time I saw them because they just carried on.

Player base. The Paladins player base is seemingly struggling at the moment as you will see that every other game you play with someone you already know, and if not them, their smurf accounts. Everyone and their grandad has smurf accounts on this game since it's a free game. And most of these smurf accounts are made with the intention to only play one character, and if that character doesn't fit into your teams composition, then guess what? They'll pick that character anyway.

[b]Finally for the good stuff...[/b]
Although I pointed out a lot of nuisances and annoyances above.. Paladins actually is a lot of fun, but it's mentally draining. The champions are a lot of fun, the abilities are great, the maps are beautifully designed, and the skins are nice (but please bring out more skins). I play Paladins almost daily recently, and I'm having a lot of fun, but some days I have to just stop playing because I'll run into the same few people who play with no intention of winning games. My strongest bit of advice is to always try play with a friend to try and reduce the chance of getting these trolls in your game.

[b]Final message[/b]
This is a brutally honest review, I play Paladins myself daily and would love to have a bigger player base. Don't let anything I said deter you from playing the game though. This is just my experience, and I think as long as you're able to just mute and ignore players who are toxic then you'll be fine. GL in game <3

14867,hmmmmmmmm
14868,Paladins has its own unique identity and deserves your attention. Hi-Rez studios has crafted a solid online hero shooter with some fun and unique twists on the genre.

14871,"Yea i mean it's good, and by good I mean it's pretty fricking good. I like it, make sure to have a friend or two to play the game with, makes it so much better. It's fun playing by yourself too but it's better with a friend or two (especially in ranked). Now there are some champions that are just annoying to play against, you will find theme quickly."

14879,"I wear a mask with a smile for hours at a time
Stare at the ceiling while I hold back what's on my mind
And when they ask me how I'm doing
I say, ""I'm just fine""
And when they ask me how I'm doing
I say, ""I'm just fine""
But the fact is
I can never get off of my mattress
And all that they can ask is
""Why are you so sad, kid?"" (Why are you so sad, kid?)

That's what the mask is
That's what the point of the mask is

So you can see I'm tryin'
You won't see me cryin'

And it just keeps on pilin'
It's so terrifying
But I keep on smilin', I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)

Been comparin' myself for so long
Been wearin' a smile for so long, it's real
So long, it's rеal, so long, it's real

Always bein' judged by a bunch of strangе faces
Scared to go outside, haven't seen the light in ages
But I've been places
So I'm okay-ish, so I'm okay-ish
Yeah, I'm okay, bitch
But the fact is
I need help, I'm failin' all my classes
They think that I need glasses
I just really wish that I could pass this (Wish that I could pass this)

That's what the mask is
That's what the point of the mask is

So you can see I'm tryin'
You won't see me cryin'
I'll just keep on smilin', I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
And it just keeps on pilin'
It's so terrifying
But I keep on smilin', I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
I've been carin' too much for so long
Been comparin' myself for so long
Been wearin' a smile for so long, it's real

14882,When u start and beat some ps4 players u feel like god..... just to be completely digested and pooped out by a tryhard mf dropping fkn 55 kills 3 games later and after you break your monitor you give the game one more chance just to get even more disappointed and hit the delete button. OR you might have GOD like reflexes and play like an actual RAT and be insane at the game playing flankers and shitting on kids losing hair in front the monitor bcz of your ridiculous gameplays.
14883,Fun game overall very satisfing to play when your good.

14888,"Fun adn enjoyable game, cool mechanics (apart from the stun, fuck the stun). It's a shame so little people play it. makes the matchmaking garbage tier, especially ranked."
14889,It's good. Just play it unless you're a guy with a fat vagene and if that's the case then go binge watch some Lifetime movies.
14890,i hate skye >:(

14901,"The best hero shooter game out there. Loads of variation. You can play one champion for 10 games with different playstyles each game. Want to go play support but your teammate ain't kicking it? Go frag with damage build instead! Want your explosive projectile to travel further instead of them exploding? You can! Honestly this game has loads of possibilities, and the roster is very interesting. A major downside though is the abundance of bugs. Some can be game breaking but these rarely happens, and the ones that often happen are the minor ones. Devs are (hopefully) constantly fixing them though. Give this game a try! Completely free to play! ...unless you want certain skins, but these are purely cosmetic, of course."

14905,"I have over 1300 hours on switch and am now working my way through the PC version and I don't think I have ever had more fun with a fps style game before. That said, the game has its flaws. Its too hardware intensive for all the better it looks, there are some weird bugs here or there, and game balance tends to be in favor of the newest champions but that said they do release bug fixes ATLEAST weekly and release constant updates for champions to make them more reasonably balanced."
14906,yes
14907,The game its self is good and fun but the lack of maps is really not helping.

14910,Big worm go RAWRRRR and spit acid
14911,"It's an ok game. I mainly play it since it's crossplatform and I have friends running it on playstation and we can play together. I most probably would have not played it if it wasn't for them.

However, after dropping Call of Duty since it got on our nerves, this was the next best crossplatform thing but overall - although fun, it's not a masterpiece. 
I would have loved to see some kind of skill tiering/ranking, more game modes, a bit more depth overall and a bit of purpose/goal."

14924,good game
14925,"Great game to play with a group of friends!
"
14926,Very nice.
14927,Paladins isn't the poor man's Overwatch. Try it out instead of instantly writing it off as an Overwatch clone and you'll see.
14928,"I really liked it as it is my first game like it.  I first watched a friend play it and it was very vivid colors and it looked really fun.  I'm not particularly good at it, but I enjoy it anyways. : )"

14932,"Thought this was Overwatch when downloading, prepared to see some hot ass widow ass and then in greeted to this, sure the women are pretty but compared to Overwatch. Its like comparing Lanar Rhoades to a women who has had an encounter with Jack the ripper. And thats the same with the games too. With Overwatch being Lanar Rhoades, which is a compliment considering how garbage it is now

14940,"Overwatch is a 2016 team-based multiplayer first-person shooter developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. Described as a ""hero shooter"", Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from a large roster of characters, known as ""heroes"", with unique abilities. Teams work to complete map-specific objectives within a limited period of time. Blizzard has added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, all free of charge, with the only additional cost to players being optional loot boxes to purchase cosmetic items. It was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows in May 2016 and Nintendo Switch in October 2019. An optimized performance patch for the Xbox Series X and Series S was released in March 2021. In June 2021, Blizzard announced that the game would support cross-platform play across all platforms."
14941,"the game very good

"
14942,Poor dev choices are ruining the game and the fact that they have a design team bigger than the programmer team only hurts even more
14943,yes
14944,"Nothings balanced which makes it kind off balanced, but it's free so it's fine."
14945,"It is basically a less balanced version of Overwatch, it's a free game so worth playing once or twice but it isn't the best choice out there."

14952,boring overwatch clone made by company that relies on cloning better games.
14953,"Much better game than tekken 7, honestly the pvp in this game is phenomenal compared to tekken 7, honestly should just buy bandai namco and ask them to remove all tekken games in existence because of the lack of femoids getting males, its creating a severe amount of incels therefore threatening the human race itself."
14954,"hands down the most original game ive ever played. absolute masterpiece that I can see winning dozens of golden globes and prestigious awards once people pull their heads out of their asses and finally start to appreciate this godsend of a video game. honestly i dont know why people bother with completely uninspired piles of dogshit like overwatch or team fortress two which are clearly just ripoffs of paladins, the superior team based first person shooter. anyways 0/5 this game fuckin sucks"
14955,"Fun game with great gunplay and gameplay customization options but sadly with a good amount of bugs, still worth playing..."

14962,"epic  game, super good. great gameplay"
14963,very good game to try and play. recommended to all players of all ages
14964,.
14965,"This game is unplayable because of cc. Don’t download it you won’t have fun. It used to be a good game but now it’s just stun for the whole match. No bug fixes, only new skins and champs wich hirez can make money with."
14966,Very cool game
14967,"DONT PLAY this game has made my life significantly worse since i started playing. it is so cancer i wholeheartedly recommend you dont play this game for real it will ruin your life.


paladins is a great fun game 5% it would be more but the matchmaking ruins the matchmaking is worse than any other game i have played you will be put in games with people over level 100 when have basically just started the machmaking is the worst point of the game also the player base is pretty bad not many toxic player that i have encounterd but everyone just pick damage in the firt 5 seconds no one runs healer or tank and even if you get them the enemy team will have a better healer or tank EVERY TIME to be honest ranked is the only playable mode but even then ranked is frustrating in a different way but there is just soo much more bad about the game then good."

I also own Overwatch but for some reason i enjoyed Paladins more, though i'm only a casual player (that might be a reason too).

There are many champions and they're all quite original."

My one complaint is this game is filled with horny weebs"
15084,this is the best fps shooter ever!
15085,"It's a fun game but has some serious bug that soft lock the game and public matchmaking is terrible with people instant locking their favorite pick without batting an eye for the missing team roles, pair together with 5 stack teams make playing as a solo the true suffering experience. But despite all that, it's still an excellent game in its genre with the customization systems and a bunch of unique character to play with."

15088,good game i like it
15089,really good game
15090,This game has become trash over the years. No balance whatsoever. There are so many characters that it becomes just pointless for new players to get into the game. Overwatch is much better.

15142,"I played a lot in 2017 they either added or made battle passes a bigger deal and I quit after that. Some times i get an itch to play it again. If your tempted to buy into a lot of the extras you might save money purchasing Overwatch, but if you have self control this is a pretty fun game."
15143,"Absolutely Hacker Infested, EAC go figures right?


So many examples of hackers, i see a Koga while playing Tyra, the koga is literally unkillable because he is regening HP at an impossible rate, when i play Koga with the exact same setup as those Kogas Tyra borderline insta kills me with 2 shots, as a koga, so you explain too me how that isn't Class A hacking right there, and this game is absolutely INFESTED with it.

Don't ever play this game, let the game die, the hackers have ruined it."

15206,"A very well-designed team FPS game. The thought that went into creating the game is incredible: all the mechanics and most of the characters (I'm looking at you, Vivian) are very well thought-out and interesting. 
There is a lot of customizability with loadouts and over 45 champions in four classes (Damage, Flank, Support, Frontline). Although you only start out with a few champions, every single character in the game is unlockable without spending money, assuming you're willing to grind a bit for in-game coins (I was).

This is my first (and only) FPS game that I've ever seriously played. A lot of people talk about server issues and the like, but in my experience as an average player I only encounter those every once in a while. 

It's also got lore and stuff but I'm not as interested in that personally but I don't have much to say about it. Each character has their own voicelines and personality to go with their unique, customizable playstyle, and no two games feel the same. 
Community is also chill for the most part - there are toxic players but that's the case in every game. Even chess has toxic players, so how on earth is an FPS game going to have none? There's a really good reporting system for toxic players and a commendation system for chill/good players, which is great.

Best with friends. Still pretty cool without. Strongly recommend!"
15207,surprisingly runs well on slower computers lol

loads of amazing characters and I'd say its a gigichad version of Overwatch , only gripe is the bugs that occur though for most part its endless hours of glorious fun.. if it be Team Deathmatch or Siege or Onslaught or Training ver. of them to do some tough challenges (-.-) its worth the free cost... I might buy skins in Future since I enjoy the Game alot 

Again with grain of salt bugs do b buggy at times at the same extent as Discord... So other then that Love the Game. 

Just haven't been able to play past few days cuz had the Paladins.exe wont boot up bug which is infuriating.. though Gr8 game fun with friends"

15217,"Paladins shouldn’t be seen just as the free alternative to Overwatch but, instead, should be praised as one of the best multiplayers nowadays. A great and addictive game that will surely entertain every kind of player thanks to its accessibility and well-developed mechanics. A solid, enjoyable hero shooter, varied and polished. Yes, it does have a lot of Overwatch DNA, but in some areas it’s more advanced than Blizzard’s game (e.g. wide range of adjustments you can make to adapt your character to your playing style)"

15231,"I love paladins! its amazing. Its a hero shooter with a ton of characters. The devs are always adding new ones. I plays like Overwatch but is much deeper mechanically. You can make a 5 card deck for your characters that affects abilities and their cooldowns. In every match you can also buy additional buffs. you get credits depending on your performance in the match.

It is a very interesting game and I would recommend it to anyone who loves hero shooters"

15322,lol
15323,"I highly recommend the game, it's a lot of fun, There are limited modes as well which makes it less boring. The purchasable aspects of the game aren't pay to win, Just pay to look good. The champion pack is a great value if you really want to have every champion and the upcoming ones as well, It's worth your money.

Keep in mind that there are still some bugs that haven't been fixed for years now but I still have hope that the state of the game is gonna get better in the future.

The matchmaking:
getting matched with some of the most brainless, bot-like players you'll ever see, Literally uncarriable teammates against an enemy team that is filled with sweaty players, And oh boy, If you are playing onslaught against them simply you ain't gonna leave your spawn. So there's that.

The cards and the talents system is what makes the game special and unique IMO; You feel more in control of your play-style and it really changes the way you play that champion, there are some problems; The servers aren't stable you simply get disconnected at least 3 times every 5 hours or so, the crashes that randomly happen for no reason and if the game crashes you have to kill the process from the task manager every time which's really annoying

But overall it's really a fun-to-play game especially if you have friends to play with."
15324,Kinda good
15325,i mean i played it for a couple of minutes its fine i guess
15326,"Nice game, I enjoy it slightly more than overwatch, it doesn't take long to get used to it. I personally think this game is better with groups of people you know because playing as a team is important; it sucks when you get matched with poor teammates. 

Overall, the game is pretty fun and I would recommend to a friend!

My perspective was as a gamer with a thousand hours in Team Fortress 2 and maybe a few hundred in Overwatch, so I expected Paladins to be a weak imitation of the class-based formula with the character bloat and over-complicated systems of a MOBA. Instead, Paladins has: really strong class-based gameplay; a comprehensible (but far from perfect) item shop that creates a distinction between early, mid, and late game; and enough characters for the developers to forget about some of them.

Paladins has its flaws with how some features are implemented, and its servers, but there are few games that can compete with its concept."

I have logged a ticket, for which I was given 3 instructions to try with no success and no follow up. 

I have been playing this game since its Beta release.. 

For reference the issue is a common one, that does not appear to have a resolution. Easy Anti cheat finishes loading and then right after that just doesn't start the game. It does not crash, and it does not tell you what the problem is.

15387,"Basically Overwatch with some differences. I've played over 1000hrs. I'm a Level 100 healer. The major differences I noticed were:

1. the in game items you buy each game to counter opponents (I love it, it adds more variety to the games/characters and overall strategy.)  
2. The 1 of 3 different abilities you choose for each character at the beginning of the match. Again, more variety and allows you to play the same character very differently. 
3. There are multiple invisible units compared to the ones on overwatch which I thought was a plus. 
4. Apparently the graphics are way worse than Overwatch, but I never play on highest resolutions so...this might be a big issue for some. 

I think Paladins has characters that can really work with people who don't have sniper skills...me...as there are Healers/Tanks/DPS characters that fit with this category. While it also has some characters that please the snipers and more coordinated players with high agility/skill characters (Evie/Vatu/Maeve). 

Community in the quick matches is good. Plenty of trash talkers but also free awards to grant players that displayed leadership/teamwork/skill. The wait time for games is very minimal...like 30 seconds still and I've been playing about 2 years."

No joke. Team members are pretty ass trash most of the time. Sort of like Overwatch. You can't really climb when every single person goes damage and can't do shit with the character. Training grounds and bot games are perfect for that kind of horeshittery. Actual matches are just ruined by fukkwads who don't know how to play the game. Either get a lot of friends to have a good time or have fun getting dicked over by shit players. 

Kept playing the game in hopes of a better game. I have since stopped playing at all. 

P.S. If you are one of those people who like to perfect games and get all those achievements you will be sorely disappointed. The devs thought it was a great idea to make one of the achievements a beta exclusive. Seeing that the beta is not available anymore you will never get that achievement. Devs are FUKKING idiots."

15437,"This ""devs"" can't even post announcements right.. It's really sad the road the game is leading too. DC's happen frequently and for no reason, the remap of the way you can get crystals and gold is stupid and impossible without grinding like a maniac, thing this game does not appeal to do lol overall its another game to spend 35 euros on a battlepass and you dont even earn the 400 crystal to buy the next one (mind you all i never spend a cent in this ♥♥♥♥) Still have the skulls from the quest on the menu to complete rofl what a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little game this as become x'D If you wanna play casual with friends is an okay game, but more deep then that its at your own risk"

15441,"Don't get this game. It might look fun at first, and at one point in its pathetic life it was, but it is the most enraging game I have ever played. Every time there is a new update (which is often) there is always a new set of bugs that comes with it. The game also likes to crash for no goddamn reason and sometimes even switching tabs on your PC is enough to cause the game to be a white screen. Every time a new champion is released, the game is unplayable for at least two weeks. The new character is always overpowered, there are bugs, the game crashes, the matchmaking is at its worst. When I don't like a game I usually just uninstall it and that's it but Paladins makes me SO angry that I WANT this game to die."
15442,its a good game.
15443,"me:Mom can we get overwatch?

mom: we have overwatch at home

overwatch at home:

overall, its not terrible, its not good either , the champs are heavily unbalanced and the servers are trash, but the community is kinda okay and its easy to get addicted to going double healer with your friends and spam ranked chats with ""cant touch me noob""

6/10, can be very fun, devs need to step their game up real fast though"

15458,"I can't believe this game is still alive. A year ago, I can't even get a match in competitive mode(Aus server) and sometimes I had A.I. teammates in normal mode. Anyway, they apparently released lots of new characters in the past 1 year. I am not going back to try them. They already screwed this game badly. 

A good game but there are bugs that exist for a long long long time. I don't get it. Just some simple bugs. Why are they not trying to fix them. They only focus on releasing new characters and new skins...etc for making money. 
I sort of dislike it and like it at the same time. however, playing with bugs for a long time really disappoints me."
15459,"If you want a game that's enjoyable, fun, doesn't need much storage, has a lot of online players, first person, and has some pretty interesting characters. This is the game for you. I played it a while ago and it was fun then and it's even more fun now! I play it almost every hour (I main Seris btw). 10/10 game right here."
15460,nice game
15461,"It's a fun game but at the time of writing the game is so buggy that it's nearly unplayable. The devs would rather add characters before fixing the plethora of bugs (imani is currently so buggy that I've played more than twice as many bugged games as her than bug-free games) and the bots in this game when your teammates leave are less than useless and STILL GET STUCK IN SPAWN almost every game I have a bot in my match the thing gets stuck for an entire round. The reasons there are so many bots is because the game straight up crashes ALL THE TIME. The servers are terrible. 

The balancing is questionable. Delete Yagorath, remove executes, bring back 90% caut. REWORK TORVALD ALREADY

I still love the game, don't get me wrong I wouldn't recommend playing it in it's current state of buggy-ness and there really isn't a similar game that has a talent system otherwise I probably wouldn't play this game anymore."

15537,"Man i can't even begin to say where my enjoyment begins anymore.
Genuinely, i loved Paladins before Terminus, however he's not the reason i can't recommend Paladins.

Hi-Rez is one of them, but the state of this game is why i can't recommend it.

Casual literally has a risk factor of matchmaking with teammates who can't even read. These people can't even see the obvious ""damage"" icons either, and instantly select their favorite champion regardless of composition.
Any kind of Balance is completely tossed out the window in casual, you'll either quit from the frustration of waiting for ranked, or play long enough to find that ranked is practically the same. You need 12 champions and level 15 to get into ranked.

What's worse is the idea they're using Root kits to block simultaneous access to a player's Task manager on their PC, in order to prevent users from leaving a match. I tried to spam ALT+F4 and the game refused to close as well. This is a major security concern for me. My PC, My control. 
Now if you do manage to open task manager and close the game in time before the match starts, you can still be given the exact same level of punishment, you'd get while playing ranked, which is Bloody ridiculous with all the issues this game suffers from. Yes, you can get a deserter tag IN CASUAL of all game modes to be concerned with, especially how bad it is.
I say this, to implore it as much as possible, Casual is the worst iv'e ever seen, in any FPS game ever. Overwatch, R6 Seige, Boruto Shinobi striker, Duel Links, nothing compares to how abysmal Paladins casual mode truly is. even League of Legends casual mode is centuries better than this.

People who refuse to work together are so common in this game, i can't blame a single person who rages inside of it.
Ranked? ha.
Seris who refuse to Pocket a Ruckus, Buck's jumping into OBJ and throwing, Enemy Maeve with the skills of Pro league gamers, teammates who barely even have a character above level 10 and require an Experienced player to carry them.

which also leads me into the fact, that it feels like the game is pairing completely New and ignorant players with those who are experienced, and expecting them to demonstrate Overpowered skills or OFF-META play-styles.
a Front-line has to become a Flank if let's say a Victor is the only one holding off the entire team.
A damage user heals themself because the support needs to heal their discord buddies.
A support becomes a flank because they think they can pocket a damage champion while flanking.

It's such a twisted environment, that half the time, i don't even know how we won or lost!
That's before the many BOTs who literally just play to farm levels. Iv'e seen so many AFK BOTs in only 3 Hours of game-play here, than my 40 or so hours on Rainbow 6 Seige.

Now, my Issues with Hi-Rez.
The events. Atrocious? yes. Greedy? Of course. Falsely stating that free to play players can earn rewards? Yep.
I'll never forget Furia's event, which started the precedent that players who play free can earn event currency, but can only gain rewards for that event by buying some form of Premium pass? The Abyss hungers was such a failure, i fear it will happen again with Shadows. Hence why I'll never buy into anything Hi-Rez makes, not even the rust off a penny is worth anything they make.

Edit:
I want to bring to awareness, after several hundred grueling matches later, ranked is....
Toxic can't even describe how awful it is. Lawless, unchained, harassment is constant.
From being called Autistic and feeding for having my own loadout. To people controlling my playstyle and belittling me for minor mistakes. it's absurd how obsessed this community is with ranked being narcissisticly precise. It's pretty much forced by the community for anyone to look-up a guidebook, to use the Perfect loadout and movement or suffer from people spamming the VGS, or using slurs to attack you. calling you a slew of insults like Retard, Moron, dumba**.
 Overwatch, Seige, and League cannot compare to this level of anger for fellow teammates who don't conform to these, mythological standards.
Paladins was so much fun back a few years ago, what the hell happened?
it went from petty ""you're bad"" and spamming VGS, with so much less toxicity over perfection.

to ganging up on the support because i feel like it, I need to control my team, your loadout made me dodge, slur, racial slur, disability slur, gender slur, braindead this, [Insert IRL criminal threat], threats of Doxxing, perfect loadout, perfect buy items, perfect aim, perfect skill use, perfect ultimate use, perfect movement, level 50 minimum for each champion, my mom, my sister, this person is a virgin for choosing [Insert champion name} and you can't pick them because others are better this one is bad.

Holy hell, if that makes any sense, please, make a translation.
My point being, this game's safety is deplorable, and an Enormous part of the community is disturbed.

after playing ranked for 4 of my 5 qualifier matches, i haven't been able to completely finish yet. Iv'e grown so discouraged, i want to continue, but i'm afraid to do so.
iv'e won twice and lost twice being matched with the same people who harassed me for the two losses. My teams which won were happy and positive, but would viciously attack the enemy team in the after game report.

it's like, this quote ""I feel as though, even when i win, I still lose in some way or another. when i lose, i lose even harder"" fits Paladins scarily well. Some people within this community seem dangerous too, what with threats of hacking and such."
15538,poggies
15539,Bagel
15540,It´s a great game and I definitely recomend it for anyone who enjoys fps games. One of the things that make it so good is that you can really customize your character.
15541,takes too much dam space
15542,"fun but it's not that serious of a competitive game, or atleast from my perspective i can't treat this game the same as i treat other tightly competitive titles. Should be pretty enjoyable with friends but alone, probably gets pretty stale quick."
15543,"a well built game with a dedicated dev team,

also, it's free"
15544,"This game is good to play with friends, it has a low skill threshold."
15545,Dont bother playing this piece of thrash as it is no longer a good game. The Asian servers are dead and unplayable. The lag will kill you before the enemy does and most of the player base is gone so you will meet the same 10 to 15 players in rank each time. The dev don't give a shit about the game and are trying to milk as much money as they can by trying to release as many skins as they can before they have to shut it down.Not only that they have run out of ideas for character and keep producing toxic or cancer champ which breaks the game in certain directions making the whole point of drafting useless. Just take overwatch character and their abilities or recycle the abilities of other character in the game. the overall experience of the game is really not what it used to be the game was actually less buggy and had good servers in the beta version. The company would rather spend money on BS such as making new games which will or have flopped then actually fix a game that could be good. If your a new player or someone wanting to go back dont waste your time.

15563,"This game is pretty much overwatch but for free. The community is amazing, and I would not want to pay for overwatch, especially because the players that play OW are always a lot better than me, whereas in this game, it is very easy to learn, and people are very willing to teach you.

That being said, this is more of an off-and-on game. It gets very repetitive after a while, so you burn out fairly fast, but if you like games of this style, it shouldn't make too big of a difference to you. I would 100% recommend you at least try this game, just to see if you like it, because I downloaded this from a friend's ""games"" list and that was a great decision!"
15564,"I love this game so much , i would even sell over*atch and start becoming a pro player in this game .

1- A REALLY GOOD MOBA + HERO GAME THAT's FREE
2- FLUID COMBAT

4- ITS REALLY ILLEGAL BUT THEIR HEROES ARE BETTER THAN OVER*ATCH ( For example , Drogoz ult can literally one shot any kids he sees ) 
5- DONT START TALKING ABOUT MAPS WITH ME , IT'S REALLY GOOD BUT THERE'S FLAW . ( There's no map that can counter maeve )
6-I REALLY HATE HOW THEIR SNIPER RIFLE MECHANICS ARE BETTER THAN MOST TYPICAL GAME . ( It is better than scar )
7- ouh yea finally , i really hate rank . ( i'm still on low elo and most of u knows how low elo people r , take me for example , now shove it in ur brain and start playing this game and stop jerking to urself on a mirror , this game is better than u . )"

15567,Better version of overwatch
15568,Game is fun and updated often. Most of the champions are balanced. I recommend you look into characters before purchasing them. Leveling up takes time and collecting coins is tedious but the game is fun enough to play for a few hours a day.
15569,is good
15570,"I've been a Paladins player since beta. I haven't played in nearly 2 years. Today, I decided to download the game and try it out. Steam shows that I have 325 hours. I also logged into Hi-rez perfectly fine. I tried logging in to Paladins the first time, they only asked for my username which was weird. It worked, but I lost all my progress, nothing was there, no skins, no champions, my level is 1, and so on"

15596,pls fix ur servers cant play nicelyt after the update
15597,bro this is the most trash copy of overwatch and contain hell of bugs. The dev dont give a damn about annoying bugs. with the new patch and the launch of character vatu their are hell of bugs with him. first i thought maybe its my internet but it was fine. the character was nothing moving properly and was like moving on his own. like when i dash front he was dashing but then he was moving back on his own. This game is broken and bugs are so damn bad that makes this game even more unplayable.
15598,"Bugs have been around for years and the dev team is more concerned with skins and releasing new content with new bugs. This game had so much potential but even with the minor, and very very infrequent fixes for how much is added, it still can't hold a candle to others of its ilk. 

Gamemodes are repetitive, and unimaginative for a game that's been around for literal years, but for some reason they can manage to put a skin every bloody month. Take what you will. 

"
15599,The game still has a lot of server issues but the overall gameplay is still very enjoyable. I just hope that this game will last for a long time.

15622,"This is a fun game. yeah I put money into this game when I could've bought overwatch. It's fun.

Not being able to change your champion in the middle of the match, the item store, and the amazing loadout system make this game more strategic than overwatch. 

While there are some balancing and bug issues, the game is updated pretty often, and is only getting better."
15623,Overwatch mixed with TF2. Paladins champions take a lot of time to die. This creates more of a tug of war over the point. Creates really good gameplay.

15653,i like the fact that its free and it gets good content release that is regular. down side some bugs and a small community
15654,I didn't play in a while so i will see is it get better or not. :)
15655,fun
15656,"This game is EXTREMELY fun and addictive. I would recommend this to just about anyone, this game can run literally on any computer that supports DX10. Maybe even DX9.0c. My ONLY complaint is the skill based match making, where you will have one or two good games in a row, and you will get thrown in a lobby full of try hards who merk you in one headshot.(While throwing you in a team full of people in the same situation, had a good game and got tossed in against pro's). Other than that, I have 0 complaints. Wish they made more maps! The art style of this game is unique, and catchy to the eye. If the developer is reading this, make Skill Based Matchmaking Optional, like make a casual matchmaking mode(no SBMM) and a competitive mode(SBMM). That would REALLY make this game feel complete."

15678,It's fast it's fun and unlike Dominion it's not gone!
15679,"If you like Overwatch, you'll love Paladins. Same concepts, but overall better game mechanics and gameplay. Champions are very well balanced. This is a team based game, so overcoming the opposition requires teamwork.

This game has a culture around it. If you can get plugged into a group, you'll be better off in the long run."
15680,DPS Seris ruined my life. 10/10
15681,It's super fun if you have a full premade.
15682,"Today, i have decided to quit this game after been playing it for 5 years in pc and ps4 i have probably spend more than 3000 hours playing by summing the my other accounts, im just sad cuz i really enjoyed, bu the community is really toxic the game doesn't put good players with fair match sometimes even wants you to carry and entire team. It is just stressful, and not fun anymore. 
Such a great game, It is a shame."
15683,"Totally an Overwatch knockoff but it would be like complaining that CoD Warzone ripped off PubG. So its more of a game in Overwatch style, however I feel like they improved a lot of things that Overwatch didnt bother to fix, add or think of. I'd rather play Paladins any day over all the other ""Overwatch style"" games."
15684,its a better version of overwatch and isnt toxic
15685,"You know Overwatch has hit rock bottom when the rip-off game made by Hirez has more interesting concepts than anything Blizzard can think of. 

Final Fantasy XIV killed World of Warcraft. Now it's time for Paladins to kill Overwatch."
15686,"i love this game, i've never seen anything else like it!!"
15687,its fun
15688,"Paladins in my most favorite online game, I'm playing this game for years now,
This is really an unique game, 
When this game came out it was really enjoyable, it still is, but the main problem of this game now is unbalanced champions. 
and a lot of issue with pings. 
There's a strange kind of issue with the pings happens after their updates and stays for weeks until they fix it up. 
The ping shows 64/94 doesn't matter, feels like 1000ping. 
Also it's not just me, when this happens this happens to everyone in that match, Included opponent team
And if they balance those OP champ like Imani,Dredge,moji,furia (with stunt card) and some other champ. 
It's just stupid when These easy to play champs are so Op and on other hand they're nerfing hardest champ like andro. 
Balance these and this game could be great again 

So do i recommend this game? 
I wish there was an option like ""Maybe"" 
If it was 2018's paladins i would definitely say Yessss"

-7/10 -
 Casual players are mostly really bad, but so are your team-mates then - you'll either have the time of your life or tilt  a whole lot.
The skins are cool, and the rewards you get from missions etc. are as well - sadly you cant rent characters like f.e in Smite,
but you'll eventually manage to buy them with coins or you just buy the bundle with cash to get every character.

15696,"As a free game goes, this is fantastic! everything feels balanced, you can easily just hop on and play it at anytime and it feels great. I've never had a problem with it, runs with little to no bugs except for my own horrible WIFI.

The gameplay is really fun, the heroes are pretty unique as well, and the game itself is very visually appealing. My only issue is that the player base is very quiet and it is hard to get people to actually communicate. I really wish people would talk and work together more, but that is not something the game itself could change. Otherwise, amazing game that I will keep playing."

This game is like an Overwatch clone, but without the strategy. I can occasionally find some fun with a friend, but it's not polished at all. There are constant audio bugs that deafen gun noise. The game almost had potential if the gameplay was more polished."

15751,very good game i do recomend enjoy.
15752,"One of the best hero shooters in my opinion. You can choose from a wide selection of champions, make a card loadout for that champion (Giving buffs to your champion and/or your abilities), and picking one of three talents for that champion, giving the player many different ways to play each and every champion. This game is very fun when you find a champion and loadout combo that you like. Overall, I would give this game a 9 out of 10 for the great team dynamic and different play styles to suite your wants/needs. If you've never played before I would highly recommend you give it a try because it is free! Thanks for reading this, hope it helps anyone wanting to know more about this game."

Paladins has had its highs and lows, it has brought me endless satisfaction and frustration, but it has remained on my list of all-time favorites since the beginning. It is an excellent game to get into, especially since it's free to play, and I couldn't recommend downloading it more. Always happy to answer questions or party up! :)"

It was a great game, hence my 826 of game time, but it is too frustrating. The toxic player are just ruining the game for me. I can't even have a nice chat with people, can't make friends because there are too many uncommunicative toxic players.
It's time to move on to be honest.

15824,"One of the best multi-player games I've ever played. Its like overwatch but if it didnt have the dev's hands smothering anything off meta or unique. The game actively encourages you to try and find new meta's with a pretty cool card + talent system that had lots of room for self expression. Like any game of course, there are ""meta builds"" and try hards, but the game is an absolute gem in spite of that,  and I can honestly say in my 400+ hours that I've never truly had the same game twice. Lastly, the Dev team simply keeps the game fun and wacky, without being gamebreaking. I recently had the pleasure of playing with a game dev who confirmed that a popular glitch/ bug has been left in for years because the players love it. Something like that would never happen in overwatch. Of course, like any review, this is just personal opinion, but if I had to summarise this review, I would simply say this:
(TLDR) If you wanna play a game with a bit more polish, but feels like an Esport wanna be with less creativity, play overwatch. If you want to play a goofy, but mechanically sound, fun game with variety, play paladins"

15828,"This game isn't Overwatch. It's closer to a MOBA than Overwatch, but I will mention Overwatch in this review, just as a comparison.

[h1]What I like[/h1]
* A lot of heroes are ""shooters"" -- they shoot something (gun, bow, etc). I find that more fun than melee.
* Tanks (front line) are pretty fun to play. Particularly compared to Overwatch. Some of them are absolute beasts (like Fernando, a knight with a sword that's a flamethrower).
* The card system adds a layer lacking from games like Overwatch or Team Fortress.
* Normally a free to play game tends to attract the worst people, griefing people in chat, etc. Shockingly, I've seen less of that here than in paid games.
* The team comp isn't forced. You can choose any combination you like (though the UI encourages you to have at least 1 of each type).
* The meta is more fun than Overwatch's. Overwatch forces a 2-2-2 composition in their main modes currently. The paladins meta is 1 healer, 1 tank (front line), 2 flankers, and 1 of flanker or damage. But it's a fairly soft meta, some teams roll with other comps.

[h1]What I don't like[/h1]
* It suffers from the same community problems as Overwatch. In Overwatch, everyone picks Damage (in Paladins, usually Flankers are chosen), often healers don't heal.
* Unlike Overwatch, you can't change your champion after the match has started (not even within a category), and can't even change the card deck. So if your team makes a terrible choice, now you've got like 15 sweaty minutes of trying to save your team, even though you know how it's going to end within the first 60 seconds.
* The sound design is inferior to Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege. In those games you have clear directional feedback of where footsteps are weapons fire are coming from. In Paladins, I haven't seen that you do.
* I think teammates use voice chat even less than Overwatch. I've never seen someone use it even once.

[h1]Other notes[/h1]
* I'm sorta surprised, particularly for a free to play game, there aren't actually that many cosmetics to purchase.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
If you like Overwatch, but want to change things up, this might be for you. I've had fun. Although I'm beginning to think the ""hero shooter"" or ""moba shooter"" game type is a fundamentally flawed concept due to people on the internet being terrible and team balance being so critical. It's not fun to respawn and get blasted repeatedly because the other team has a balanced comp and yours doesn't. It's no fun doing that to another team either -- no challenge. And yet -- I keep playing these things."
15829,"This game is realy adictive and fun to play, I highly recomend this if you like fast, movement based, team games."
15830,Not fun.
15831,I love this game i Will def play more of it
15832,"I've been gaming online since Battlefield 2 and playing free-to-play titles since GUNZ: The Duel. I've played every Blizzard title and was super excited for Overwatch only to realize shortly after it's launch that I HATE IT with a passion. Paladins addresses and improves upon everything I hate about Overwatch, from the forced reliance on teamwork to the static playstyle of each of it's heroes. Thanks to customizable builds a-la SMITE, Paladins allows you to play a character the way you want it to be played. Each of the 3 game modes are easy to pickup and each champion is intuitive enough that anyone can pick it up and have fun immediately. Skill is rewarded regardless of the role you choose to play, and a well played team of nothing but damage & flank characters can sometimes outgun a team more ""properly"" composed. In Siege mode (payload), when you capture the point your team is awarded a point, with a successful push to the enemies spawn awarding another, a successful defense on the enemy side awards a point, and the first to 4 points wins. This often leads to intense final round clashes unlike comparative hero shooters where people give up, swap out of their roles to play a character that's more fun rather than trying to win, or just become intensely toxic toward their team.

The one downside I'm starting to notice about Paladins is that I personally find no reason to buy into the season pass.. the rewards are lackluster and few champions have what I'd consider enough skins - especially enough skins I want - and ESPECIALLY enough skins that are attainable without real money purchases. You have to give me an attainable grind to things I want before I'm willing to dump money on the extras (looking at you too, Destiny.)"

15853,"Paladins is a Hero Based FPS, often compared to Overwatch as it released not long after, however Paladins has a larger character roster, different mechanics and more variability in playstyles. For example, each Champion can be played with a minimum of 3 different styles using their different talents, their talents will often change their attacks or abilities so they have to be used differently, the game is free, all champions can be unlocked for free by playing, or by buying the Champion pack, they can also appear on the free rotation, there's 4 different champion types with different playstyles, Damage, task is mainly to help focus pressure on the point, Flank will go around the map and try to finish off low health targets, attack the enemy Flank and take out high priority targets from behind like the enemy Support, Frontline's task is to pressure the point or push the enemy team back while the team captures the objectives,Support's job is to keep the team alive or boost the team with shields and damage boosts, they also should focus on keeping the frontline alive, overall the game is fun, competititve is rather toxic, but that's common in games.
Hope this helps."

15855,it was alright but they need more gamemodes maybe a domination or something this is just a wannabe overwatch

15858,"As a hero shooter game, I can't think of any that matches the quality and content of this. While there are certain gripes to be had, like the time a f2p need to invest to unlock each character, and sometimes the salty and awful people that you meet in matches, there aren't much else to complain about. (well, say what you want about the balance, but i think ITS OK)

Paladins has a wide array of characters to choose from, and you are sure to find one you enjoy the most. Even if it isnt viable in the meta, nothing is stopping you from playing them anyway. Sort of.

So, if overwatch isnt for you, then you might as well go ahead and try this out."

15868,its nice but the chaters are onbalenst but health is good tho its gooooood game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
15869,"Okay. This game is similar to Overwatch. Pardon my ignorance here, but I'm pretty sure this came first. Now that that's out of the way. In my honest opinion, this game is superior to Overwatch in Pretty much Every single way. (Save for the physics and interactive environments.) 

Character selection is locked. Once you choose a character to play as, you're locked into it for the match. This is pretty neat, because of the item system. The item system allows you to take a character, and adapt it to the situations that the match calls for, such as, Lowering healing effects on the enemy, Faster reloading, Increased movement speed, Reduced damage, increased incoming healing, lifesteal, etc... These two systems, for the most part, make strategy almost as important as knowing how to use the Character you've chosen. 

Character Variation and selection. Paladins has over 35 champions. There are Support (Healers,) Tanks, Damage, and Flank Classes. Each has it's overall role, each is necessary for a good team build, and it's very balanced in this regard. Each champion in the game feels different from the rest, and there are no two champions that play exactly the same. Each champion has 3 different special abilities that they can choose at the beginning of the match, enabling even more variation in the characters, game to game. 

The maps and game modes are usually very well balanced. As this game is a PVP based game, obviously the outcome of the game is going to differ match to match, but overall, the maps and game modes keep the game interesting. There is Siege, Onslaught, and TDM. Siege is my usual game type, push the cart to the enemy point, (Much like TF,) Onslaught is basically King of the hill. TDM... Well, that's self-explanatory. For PVE, and new players, there is a ""Training"" mode, VS. AI, so you can learn the different champions and get some target practice in. Every once in a while the AI teams stumble on some magical team, and can be a challenge. So, there's a bit of something for everyone. Another bonus to Training mode, is that the Challenges for the battle passes are able to be progressed against the AI as well, so, that's cool if you're having trouble with some of them. 

Battle Passes. Okay, so, this is a sore spot for some, and I get it. But hear me out. Hi-Rez made this game, and you can play it for free with little limitation. The battle passes enhance the items you get as you progress, and typically they last anywhere from 2-3 months, (Spitballing, I'll let you know in a few days when the next one drops.) the price is reasonable, and they give you ample amount of time to earn enough gems, through the challenges, in order to keep getting the future passes for free, (Again, you just have to complete the Challenges, and earn the gems in order to buy the next one.) This, I feel is more than reasonable. This game is Free To Play, but if you enjoy it, support the developer so you may continue to enjoy it. 

The Micro-Transactions are all cosmetic, title and avatar based. Meaning, pay or no, your ability to win is not hampered or amplified. The only thing I can say, mildly negatively about Micro-Transactions is that with the way that you unlock characters, you can just buy gems and unlock them. I don't mind this at all, again, I love the game, I'm going to support it, and to be fair, this is a convenience thing. If you don't want to do this, all characters are unlocked in any order you desire, with gold earned round to round. I would recommend that everyone buys them with gold for the first 100 hours or so of the game, as it will only cause you to learn the characters you have and make you better at the game through experience, rather than having 35+ Characters to pick from and no idea how to play. 

There is a ranked mode. Special rewards for playing competitive, That's cool, not my cup of tea but it's there for all you MLG wanna-be's. ( I'll touch on this when I get to my gripes.)

Gunplay is refreshing, Movement is smooth, and the game runs great, even on Potatoes. Meaning, even if you have an ancient PC, you'll likely be able to run this. Which is great! 

Now, I do have one major gripe about this game, and it's not really about the game, and more about the community. I play this game a lot. I play with a group of friends, I've done so for the past couple of years, on and off. My stats reflect an above even Win-rate, and positive K/D ratio. Now, I'm not saying this to puff myself up, it is what it is, I know how to play. The issue is, when you get into Pubs, (Or ranked which is far worse,) There are a LOT of Toxic, whiney little children, thinking that they know your character better than you do, or that their tactics work better than yours, or by default, blame you for their shortcomings. Unsportsmanlike conduct and temper tantrums run rampant, and honestly, the toxicity can, at times, be very intrusive. You can mute the morons, but the fact is, with a game like Paladins, TF, Overwatch, etc... You need to communicate, and Whiners, blame placers and trash talkers, pretty much make it so that this does not happen and most people mute the Voice Chat by default. The one thing I will give Blizzard/Overwatch is that they do take unsportsmanlike conduct a bit more seriously then Hi-rez, and the community, while toxic, isn't quite as bad. Guys, it's a game, a free one at that, get over yourselves and have fun. You want to play MLG style, group with a team and play ranked, stay out of pub and for the love of god, play a game that's not largely F2P, see how you fare in Overwatch, eat your humble pie, and come back a little more human. 


Overall, this game is one of the few that I keep coming back to. There's enough variation to keep you interested. It'll take you a year or two to unlock all of the characters, and each one has it's own learning curve. There is a LOT of replay value, and honestly, it's fairly well balanced. I would recommend this game to anyone who only has time to play a couple of 15 min rounds, or anyone who's a fan of the FPS genre. It's a great game overall. Polished, fair, completely voluntary Micro-transactions, and high replay-value. 10/10 for me. Download it, you won't be out anything if you disagree with me and don't like it. But if you find that you do agree with my assessment, you may find yourself a new favorite game."

15880,"PvE Review: I had a hard time trying to start this review, so I figured I'd just list the Pros and Cons.

[b][u] Pros [/b][/u]
The bots are an odd difficulty. It's hard to say, but they are balanced. They will punish you if you don't play as a team, but can be pushed over with even a decent squad. All modes are available to play against AI, and quests and Trials can be completed in PvE, allowing you to play the game however you want, mostly. The PvE servers are populated, so there's not games where you have to play with and against AI, you'll mostly get other players.

[b][u] Cons [/b][/u]
Anytime they release anything, whether it be anniversary stuff or whatnot, it always requires you to play 2 non-bot games to receive them. It's kinda stupid IMO, but I'm no developer. The game, in PvE, can feel really repetitive really quickly, but friends can help alleviate that a bit.

Overall, the game is free, what've you got to lose? It's fun and engaging in both PvP and PvE and the devs mostly don't force you to play a specific way."

15888,"PROS:
- a lot of Champions
- High learning curve
- Champions can be bought with ingame Gold [Free2play]
- Choose your own Playstyle with Loadouts you can make yourself.


CONS:
- VERY Toxic Community, no matter how good or kind you are, you WILL get flamed.
- Ranked doesnt make sense, you get matched against Masters when you are platin rank.
- game has still the same bugs of Open Beta
- Small variety of Maps.
- less amount of player, you will meet the same players in ranked over and over again once you hit Master/Grandmaster.

Other than that, it is a good game to play if you looking for fun with friends, i cant recommend the competetive side of this game tho."

Steam has permanently banned me from the Steam forums by claiming that me informing this community that Steam is refusing to tell me if they're going to ban me should I publish my emails with hirez constitutes trolling.

As for your recent banned screenshot, that was reported by other players and deemed to be a violation of our rules and guidelines.

I appreciate your efforts in abiding by the rules and guidelines.

The banned screenshot that they refer to, is them issuing a second ban to my account, on an issue they had already banned me before.

>>Will let everyone know about how the lawsuit will go<<

I give this game a FRAUD/10

Update: Did you know that Steam would like to claim that, even though they happily take your money along with their cut when you purchase games in their platform, that this is not their problem? Guess who's also going to be included in the lawsuit?

[h1] Update: We have won the battle folks, but the plot thickens![/h1]

I raised a huge stink in the PALADINS forum, and I started my legal preparations in order to sue Hirez into forcing them to give me access to my legally owed DLC. This was a matter of principle. Eventually, I got them to back down, because they knew for a fact that they'd be losing this in court, and despite their initial nonsensical claims, I was able to get access to my DLC perks.

Their mods however, in collaboration with Steam support, have banned me from the forums, in an attempt to stop me from publishing the transcripts of my communication with hirez customer support.

By the way, here is the scheme that they used to do just that:

[olist]

[*]One of their shills started trying to derail the thread where I was discussing this issue, by making blatantly false statements.

[*]I called them out on their lies, by comparing and contrasting quotes from the thread that clearly demonstrated that they were lying.

[*]Steam support swooped in, and gave me a warning that I was ""attempting to bait users into non-constructive arguments"" specifically because of my post where I was pointing out that a certain individual was lying in order to derail the thread.

[*]Using that as an excuse, they deleted my own comments and they locked my thread

[*]By the way, the false claims are still left up, posts where people were calling me an ""ape"" for daring to challenge hirez to court are still left up, posts where people were calling me a liar (with no evidence to back their statements) are still left up, because those types of posts, according to steam support are not ""non-constructive posts"".

[*]The forum mods then prohibited me from posting the transcripts of my communication with hirez, which then led to me getting banned from the forums due to a ""Failure to properly listen to warnings on Duplicating and Reposting threads that pertained to the original locked thread.""

[/olist]

Diabolical? Infernal? You decide! I'll keep you posted on this one

Now, regarding the transcripts, I was originally planning on posting them here, but there is a character limit, and probably Steam support will use it as an excuse to nuke this review as they have done so in the past. Instead, here's what I'll be doing:

A) Since Steam support has never been able to explain why I can't respond to the comments in my own reviews, I am currently pestering them to fix it.

B) I am also in the process of getting Steam support to explain their bogus claims that led to my ban from the forums, which could eventually lead to me getting the ban reversed, and I'll be publishing the transcripts there. They've already tried to give me their typical ""we have investigated ourselves and we have concluded that we haven't done anything wrong"", but it didn't fly. They won't be getting away with this one, and I'm only warming up.

C) I went through the general guidelines, and I couldn't find an explicit reason that states that Steam disallows this kind of thing, but since we're talking about Steam support here, and the only time when you know for a fact that they're not lying to your face, is when they're not talking to you, I'll get them to officially state if I can or can't post these transcripts here, and more importantly if the answer is no, I'll get them to explain WHY NOT. If Steam indeed disallows people from exposing fraudulent behavior in their platform, then hilarity will ensue, and you can trust me on that.

D) Till then, should anyone like to read the transcripts, kindly send me a message in my profile, and we'll figure it out in private.

The message that I would like to send to anyone reading this, is that you should never tolerate corporate degeneracy. This has nothing to do with money, this is a matter of principle. Anyone that tells you that you should take fraud with a smile and do nothing deserves your contempt. Don't give them a single cent.

Is a corporation (or even Steam itself) denying you your legal rights? Make it publicly known that you're going to sue their pants off, start your process and KEEP RAISING AWARENESS. Shills and mod/dev alts in the forums will try to scare you into thinking that this is extremely pointless and expensive, or that any of these issues is actually YOUR fault (actual argument btw, actual human beings tried to argue that to me) but do know that most developed countries have consumer protection watchdog agencies that handle these cases on your behalf FOR FREE. I repeat FOR FREE. Many of the features on Steam that we now take for granted, have been won through legal actions, by such consumer protection watchdog agencies, so don't underestimate their power. Typically, these spineless corporations will back down before you get to court, but even if they don't, go through the process, and sue them into oblivion.

No, seriously. When in doubt as a consumer: sue, sue, sue. And then sue some more. If you're starting to worry that you may be overdoing it with the lawsuits, sue twice as much and then repeat the process. Don't give these people an inch, because they'll take a mile.

This game is buggy, has networking issues and honestly feels like it would still be in early-access, if it wasn't for the large roster. This doesn't make it not enjoyable however, as it is a fun alternative to games like Overwatch and other class based shooters. 
I used to play this game a lot back in the game, and I don't feel like it has improved.. at all. It honestly seems more bugridden than before and all of the cons combined make the game feel abandoned.

Pros:
-Doesn't require a very good gpu, so can be played half-decently on most modern laptops.
-Fun artstyle and (some) quirky and interesting characters
-Big roster that fits almost all playstyles

Cons:
-Pretty toxic community, atleast in quickplay and lower ranked ranks.
-Buggy, networking is iffy and although my graphics are set to high and I have good frames it still looks like a blur.
-Some characters are uninspired and some are just not fun to play (against)
-Head hitboxes seem inconsistent and messy
-Very expensive skins and a chest system so you need to be lucky to get the one you want

Overall.. I really don't think this game is good (anymore). It is a solid base of a class based team shooter and with a big roster to boot, it seems very cool at first glance. It's underwhelming and honestly unpolished, even after 3 years of full release now.
That doesn't mean I don't recommend trying it though. It's fun, the abilities and characters feel powerful and cool. You shouldn't go into this game with high expectations, not with rose-tinted nostalgia glasses, because it doesn't hold up."
16014,Beautiful game. Enjoy it a lot!
16015,Gaming at its finest
16016,"First of all, I would like to address the main problem I and many other players are facing - the SEA servers are horrifically bad with lag, forced disconnections and glitches. If you are playing in any Asian country, Papua New Guinea and Australia then expect your gameplay to be seriously hampered by lags and crashes. We have been complaining this to the developers, Evil Mojo Games, for several years now but nothing was done about it.

Another pressing problem is the lack of moderation from the game's staff and moderators, with cyberbullies harassing other players and Taliban-supporters using the game's chat system to spread their ideologies but were never banned even after a year has passed.

On a more positive note, this is a fun free MMO which only asks money for cosmetics.

If you have played TF2 before then this game would be the less stressful alternative. And just look at all these cool and interesting characters. So many characters, so many skins, so many alternatives."

16077,"The thing i like more about paladins compared to overwatch is that you can't change a hero in 1 playthrough which give more immersion. Gameplay wise it felt pretty much the same, solid overall. 9/10"
16078,"fun game, free overwatch"
16079,hard to get new characters(JK)
16080,"It has some problems I think are fixable. More formats than 5v5, and more gamemodes than TDM, point capture, and hybrid payload would do wonders. (5v5 is good competitively, but it means that every single team member is essential, and if one is slacking, has no idea what ""team composition"" means, or is just AFK, you're in for a bad time.)

But the heroes themselves are great, and every one I've tried has been very fun, even the ones that aren't my favorite. And this is one of the few games where it's been so fun that I play far longer than is needed for efficient progression.

And while it's definitely a game of ""pay to get cosmetics"", you can get everything if you are patient enough, as there are opportunities to get the paid currency every once in a while for free.

This was definitely a ""download on a whim"" thing for me, because I liked the look of one of the heroes - I didn't expect to like it this much, since I knew all of its flaws before playing, and none of its good points. But I was pleasantly surprised, and it's gotten on my ""play often"" list already."
16081,"Much more then a Poormans' version of Overwatch!

Pros: 
- Easy to unlock characters as coins are easy to come by.
- Great Graphics
- Non-Toxic community 
- Solid Anti-cheat system 
- Addictive 
- It's free!
- Challenging learning curve for some champions

Cons:
- Raum and Skye need a nerf (they are too op)
- Needs a penalty or Timeout for AFKers
- Matchmaking isn't really skill-based 

Overall:
At it's current state I give the game a 9/10 not much to complain about this free to play game.

"
16082,nice game dude
16083,"I wish I could recommend this game, I really do but it in every way continues to feel like Hi Rez’s unloved stepchild. The gameplay is fairly solid, balance is about like it’s competitors so nothing of note there outside of a couple outliers. The problem is like with most of Hi Rez’s games, polish. You can make the free to play argument but that would be ignoring Hi Rez’s financial history. In reality they put all their cards on Esports and care very little for their casual playerbase. 

Much like Smite, this game’s micro-transactions are within reason but the removal of the “Ultimate God Pack” equivalent is perplexing to say the least. Maybe it was for a good reason, I am far from an expert but it’s a change I was not too fond of considering it was already limited in comparison to Smite’s version.

All in all the game is not bad, it just needs work that clearly isn’t going to be put into it. If you just want a time sink, sure this works but there are better options out there at this point.

What's the requirement to run it? Anything that isn't made out of potato should be able to run it, but there's lots of issue you will run into even with the best setups.
Replayability? The sheer amount of character is enough for you to play for a long while, although some might not suit your playstyle.


I'll be damn honest this game sucks in its own way, i.e lots of bugs, toxic players in high elo, and so on. But if you can get past those its a great game to play with friends.

16144,It is honestly a very well made game and a treat to play with my friends.
16145,"It's just free overwatch, that's it. But somehow, it's fun. The only thing that I don't really like is that most of the characters are locked but you don't HAVE to pay, You can play until you get enough coins to buy them all but that would take, forever, Personally I have the champion pack which I bought for $10 during the black friday sale. unfortunately you can't buy the champion pack which makes it a little worse but if you like the characters you don't have to unlock it's pretty cool.  The game is good, It's a shooter you get the payload you kill 40 people, you stand in the point. It's an online fps. I think you might be able to turn off the chat because there are a lot of toxic people who won't play the game, just point out that everyone else is bad. But if you don't mind that you're fine. Overall. good game if you have the money."

The game is fun (w/ friends) and have a lot of potentials but it's one of those game that Hi-Rez decided to kill for no reason. The game is not polished at all, they release one hero every two months without fixing broken character that have been out prior, the balance and matchmaking is a mess and there's bugs since the beta that haven't been fixed yet. Would love to recommend it but the current lack of real interest by Hi-Rez and the developer is really sad."

16204,It is a very good free hero shooter. It is a little bit grind now as you have to work hard to unlock champions. Cosmetics are not as good as it used to be as dev decided to drop the mix and match feature
16205,"Hello, Overwatch refugee here!
     My friends and I have a lot of fun with this game, the characters have so many unique and interesting qualities, and it's a lot of fun making loadouts that fit your play style for each champ. Being able to pick items during the match to make you more powerful, sustainable, and to counter the enemy is a great feeling, something I wish Overwatch had. That being said, there are some things that bother me.

     I highly dislike the change to the battlepass system. It went from 120 levels all the way down to 24. It takes way longer to level up, so much so that I forget there's a pass active half the time. It doesn't feel very rewarding to me, since it's a somewhat agonizing crawl through it. They added ""Trials"" which is a series of challenges that you can work on two at a time. This is a fantastic concept, however, you can't pause or abandon a trial that you spent a ticket on. If you're having trouble finishing the trial or you get bored of it and want to switch it out for another one, you can't, you're stuck with it until you finish it or the pass ends. 

     Furthermore, the matchmaking is not always that great. Maybe they've lost a large part of their playerbase, or maybe their MMR system is not good, because casual games and ranked games can be all over the place. This is a bit of an outlier for an example, but I solo queued into a ranked match when my rank  was gold 5 and I got put in a full lobby of Masters players. That's a difference of 3 whole divisions. All of the characters I play were either taken or banned and I basically lost the game for those guys because I obviously wasn't supposed to be there. It was a bad time for everyone on my team. 

     The skins they're putting out are very hit-or-miss, and my friends and I sometimes take multi-month breaks from the game because the matchmaking can really ruin our fun, but ultimately we always come back. This game can be insanely frustrating for many reasons, but I love it."

16262,"Think of it as a more basic, casual, and accessible alternative to Overwatch.
The graphics look like it's the XBox 360 version of Overwatch.
But it runs on much weaker machines, and requires less network bandwidth.
It has huge old-fashioned hitboxes, so it's easier to aim.
It has a lot of characters(champions here instead of heroes), A LOT.  
If you're bored of Overwatch, this could be interesting.
If you like the idea of Overwatch, but it's just too much for you... this could be interesting.
If you want a unique experience that sets itself apart from Overwatch?  Eh... not so much.

People seem to love to spam the in game chat options (super annoying when you're in a fight and theyre spamming the same voice over option every .5 seconds) only way to shut it off is to shut off all voice over, which can put you at a disadvantage.

16334,"its a fun game, most of us are comparing it to other games like:"" uh that champion is identical to someone from league of legends"" or:"" this game is the free version of overwatch"" and i guess those are not wrong but how can we blame the developpers its so hard to make something original when every single character is in some other game yet again i think that to have funyou just hae to find the right one for you even if its incredibly similar to another game doest that obbligate you to play something else?"

16344,"Free overwatch, but in all seriousness its really fun."
16345,anjay
16346,Game is just becoming worse and worse. No wonder tho. It is Hi-Rez
16347,"Paladins is a pretty fun F2P team shooter. At first glance it may seem very similar to Blizzard's Overwatch, and that isn't just skin deep. The game modes are similar and there are some characters with similar styles and moves. But in all reality this game has had more of a pull for me than OW. The different maps that actually suit one play style over another per map. (Long range maps, close range maps) The broad spectrum of characters and powers really makes it feel like, for the most part, you can play any character and be good at them. Overall I would recommend everyone to at least give this game a few matches of tries."
16348,"Why am I reviewing this game just now? Well before I played in the main launcher which was the OG launcher.

Paladins, I only have 3 words to explain simple, fast, balanced.

Simple, Yes it is simple why? You can easily learn how the champions work, you can easily learn the game mechanics, actually not that easy but when you get the hang of it it will be easy, It is challenging as there are too many things to look out for many enjoyable champions and gameplay's you can do whatever role will suit you the best.

Fast, You know why its fast because, the game and gameplay is fast paced every mode is fast let it be siege, onslaught, deathmatch, rank game its still very fast it is very competitive but it is still a fast game mode mixed with so much aiming and comms and teamwork, well lets not forget to think fast of what the hell is happening in the match.

Balanced, am I being sarcastic or not? 50/50, slight sarcastic, slight not-being-sarcastic, half is balanced half is not, have the right items to buy things will be balanced wrong items nope you lost, right cards for your champion alright balanced. Champions hmm.. It is, you heard me the champions are balanced. Tiberius is excluded I hate the damage on that guy I mean its the reason why he always gets banned in rank, but every champion in the game has its unique gameplay that makes it balanced cause in the end it will be your gameplay and your teams gameplay on how you will counter the enemy team.

Alright this is all I have to say Paladins great game I love it and some of you surely loves it too, once you get in the game first time and get to feel the game you'll keep coming back at it, enjoy the game.

(P.S. I hate Tiberius mains)"
16349,"This game is a good balance between aim, gamesense and ability usage depending on the champion and the role also it is far different from overwatch in terms of gameplay.
let's go to the negatives now: BUGS (lately the dev team have been fixing them)
also we want the play of the game back."
16350,good game
16351,one of the best games to have fun with friends!!!

If you don't care about the crypto miner that'll shit on your computer for some reason, this game is also filled with bots with perfect aim. I played a couple matches and came across no real people. Just bots that always know where you are even if you're invis and will never miss."

16372,"Such an underrated game and devs constantly get hate for no reason ,
Paladins has probably got the most passionate devs I have seen in games , constantly trying new stuff and improving game every patch while working close with community
And it also helps that the skins in this game are so cheap yet so much effort put into each one of them compared to other games out there these days ,
you can even get a lot of them for free,
It's one of the most fun PvP experiences you can have ,do give it a try ,
don't listen to the people who try to trash talk this game,they all have multiple thousand hours on this game and just got burnt out like me"

Kissing invisible walls because map reworks are map repoops

16418," A great team based game that is really easy to run I recommend just about everyone to give this game a try.
It is fun for casuals but does have ranked and a big Esports community making it welcoming to new players but hard for returning players. I have been a fan of Paladins for a few years and recently had to make a new steam account, which made me realize how little pay to win aspects are in the game were most common players put no money in the game."

there's a very broad variety of characters to choose from, which makes paladins unique."

16427,"7/10. Fast action and enjoyable fighting mechanics. 

Here are the issues I see. 
-Some characters are completely broken while other characters are literally food just there to feed the enemy. Of course they release patches, but they get abused enough before that. 
-The hit boxes are huge. You don't even need to aim which is kind of annoying. Maybe it's just me.
-Nobody uses voice coms. If they want to talk, they will type. Even in ranked, almost nobody is speaking.

I rated it as a 7 because the core game is still fun, even with the flaws."
16428,i found a funny ass group and i almost piss on my self
16429,"plays like league of legends if there was no minions, and it was an fps. pretty fun but equally frustrating if you haven't played a game where item strategy and team comp matters

fun game, but doesn't work on your preferred operating systems due to easy anti cheat, therefore i can not recommend"
16430,"Edit: Yet again, steam wants me to review. Fine aiming with STEAM overlay gyro still works 50% of the time. Makes playing fun 50% of the time.

Edit: STEAM is asking if I want to review again. Gyro still doesn't work about half the time. There are characters I literally just cannot risk playing. I haven't been able to play ranked for at least a year. If you read this please fix gyro aiming.

Edit: Please, I hate to negative review. I want to love this game and cannot deal with the lag of my switch. If any devs read this please fix controller support on PC. Gyro randomly doesn't work. Control in general doesn't work. How do I play if my controller isn't there? End Edit

Could be a great game. The mechanics, lore, and characters are a lot of fun. Maps are decent. Lacks a little polish, but is also F2P. On top of the hours logged here, I've logged 1000+on the Switch.

Problems? Game-breaking bugs everywhere. Characters will lag from one place to the next. I play with motion controls, which work about 65% of the time, and when they randomly cut out suddenly I'm not set up to properly aim. Controls will randomly glitch out entirely, causing the character to become unresponsive and camera to aim in randomly-shifting directions. Other players will disconnect, and you are left with a pretty useless bot rather than pop in another queued player. Ranked matchmaking is notoriously terrible. I actually gave up on it because the bugs/disconnects/etc. will cause you to lose randomly. I've been playing for a couple of years now, I think, and the player-base is increasingly toxic.  

They are great about coming out with new content, but I wish they would spend a cycle or two fixing bugs to get the game in a more playable state."

16457,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

But coming back to this game using my old account I can say this game is so much fun to play now. They have improved so many systems like getting rid of the pay to win mechanic of buying chests for cards, and has balanced many champions. To be completely honest this game has drawn a lot of inspiration from Overwatch back then to the point of copying it in some manners when it first started, but that shouldn't stop you from playing it. This game has evolved and has created so many new champions that are fun and original, and they continue to strive for balance in them. The devs are also making it very friendly to people who don't want to spend money to the point of adding challenges to unlock cosmetics and in game currency, and improving their bounty store in which you can get skins by playing the game. 

I recommend you try this game out if your looking for a fun free FPS to grind.

And if you are to spend money I recommend buying the season pass. It unlocks all classes and gives a lot of currency to use and its well worth your money.

16523,its ok
16524,"Most fun MOBA game I've played, maybe because I haven't played many games to this day, but still. OG player here, through the ups and downs (oh boy, the downs), 5 years, going strong. Some annoying characters, some awesome. Pretty balanced, but SO MANY BUGS. WHY SO MANY BUGS AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. And it crashes sometimes for many people. But you know, it's free and it's doing pretty well regarding that."

16541,"After spending a decent amount of time playing Paladins, I have come to the conclusion that this game is fun as long as your expectations are set very low.

That's not a jab at Hi-Rez studios either, it is just enjoyable in a really janky way. The heroes are pretty fun to play. There is a good variety of them. The maps are beautiful. Overall, just a decent free-to-play game.

On the flip side, the balance is awful. The community is what you'd expect of a free-to-play game. And Hi-Rez seems more interested in trying to address the toxcicity in the community instead of fixing the bugs, random crashes, imbalance, awful mathmaking, rampant AFKing, etc. that seem to breed the toxcicity.

I played to experience something new. I stayed to learn the ins-and-outs of the game. And I left because of the community. The community is very casual. It is very common to have someone just AFK in the middle of your game, or legitimately sit in spawn trolling. I have never received confirmation of a report being followed-up on or punished. Overall just seems like the type of game that's not very competitive or has any competitive integrity."

16543,"The game is fun with enjoyable characters and good looking maps, and its not pay to win, the downside is that its a Hi Rez game and the balance could be a bit better,"
16544,"Although the game plays nice and looks nice, the community is full of trolls... 
Going 3 healers? Full dmg? No problem man all is good.
There should be a report option for trollpicks as well as queue per class so you avoid these kind of things!"

16559,"Playing ranked in this game is like hanging yourself to the ceiling by the balls, This game need some changes in the menu, it can get annoying, when you cannot go to your role, because you are last pick, you cannot pick your hero, because you are last pick. And of course, last pick = Tank/Supp. some role selection could help the game, but since its missing most matches are like a free for all, go where you want, they cannot do anything against it. The community is a 50/50: half of them is nice, but the other half, oh my god. Rather go back to play Overwatch than this, at least there is some kind of role selection in OW."

16568,This game is great! If you enjoy overwatch and enjoy shooters that require skill similar to MOBA games this is a good choice. I love the character variety and options. This is ideal for someone that likes competitive play as well!
16569,"I only played it due to the fact I'm poor and can't afford Overwatch. I still can't believe I wasted money on this (experience on 2019) still sad that valorant is laggy for me then this game. Nice game, they add new champions like every month or so? I haven't been playing since 2019 but Octavia is new ig, and it's free! If you lag on Valorant and can't afford Overwatch, then you should try this game, if you really like to play this kind of genre games."

16589,"the game is amazing, after you get the hang of it you will hardly stop playing, recommended 100% if you have friends to play with, playing solo is ok but it just doesnt deliver after a while for me."
16590,"I can't believe how addicting this game really is, mobility/movement is great, abilities are great, anything to do with characters is great. Graphics are very well made and textures are surprisingly good for a game like this, I'm sure that a lot of work went into this game. This runs without lag AT ALL for me, and cross-play works as it's supposed to. There's many strategies on each map and every game is different regardless of what map/game mode it is, even if it looks exactly the same, you still have a million different pathways and patterns to try out. It reminds me of Overwatch, although I don't think it goes really deep into the lore. I recommend playing this with a couple of friends, there's a party and team chat and a built-in voice chat option which means third party applications (e.g Discord) are not necessary, refferal links give rewards, and you get an XP boost for playing in a party. Overall great game, no flaws for me at all, 5 Stars."

the developers pump out new champions, new skins, new seasons passes like it's nothing.

I love this game, I love the art style, I love the core idea, but it has been severely neglected.

I want this game to be a success, but they think they can distract the community from all the problems with new skins, new rewards.
The people that put in thousands of hours, the people that really care for the game, thy are being ignored.

16641,"this game has always been plagued by coming out in the same period as overwatch and despite it being in development before OW it gets called a clone to this day...i have no hate towards OW, i played it a tonne and enjoyed it despite all the frustrations i had with it...but paladins is it's own thing...always was...people think that it's a ''cheap version of OW''  based on some dumb opinions who think that ow invented the genre or something...and they write off the game without trying half the roster which currently 48(soon to be 49) champs...with most of em having at least 2 to 3 different ways to play them and sometimes a complete role change...skye for ex. can become a supp if u want(a good one as well) even tho she's designed to be a flank.on the other hand pip can become a monster dps with some off supp traits in the right hands.plus the custom loadouts systems helps u make the really ur own...u like more speed go for it...wanna be a bit tanky add some HP...want lower CD u got it on most abilities...some abilities get augmented by cards that change how they're used like bombking's jolt card and they're way more depending what champ ur making a build for...not to mention items in this game tho not perfect by any means solve a huge problem in ow which how overbearing and hard to balance barriers, CC and healing are in the game...remember GOATS meta?...ye no one liked that i can tell u as much...it was unfun to watch and imo unfun to play as well...the reason this isn't a prob in paladins is the existence of the items strore which helps u counter stuff like healing,CC, shielding and so on...if u like OW...don't follow the stupid bandwagon of ''OW CLONE REEEEEEE.'' and give this game a proper shot...invest some time into trying new champs every week on free rotation look up some tutorials to help with certain mechanics and different builds or just ask for help in the community tab or reddit. people will help...the players can be dense sometimes especially new players who don't understand the way to properly play roles like frontlines and supps and just flame cause they think they're doing well on dps(it has that in common with OW i guess) but if u ignore that and just do ur thing this game is easily hundreds of hours worth of fun. the game has had a rough life after ob64 but it's miles better now and it's genuinely fun and in a much better spot in every way...also i don't see why u can't play it AND ow...crazy i know...i'd still take this one tho personall...i like the characters more in terms of variety, overall design and they just feel more satisfying to play regardless of the role...also the lore is cooler imo since the devs have more freedom cause of the game's fantasy esk setting...btw paladins wiki is the one stop for everything paladins...lore...detailed champs kits...full voice line of each champions''skins included'' nad much more...

this game is great if u bare with it and give it a chance and i defo 100% recommend it to anyone who enjoys this genre."

16664,"What a fun game, love the graphics and game music/sounds! A great game , its like Overwatch (Only its free and its also not pay to win!,""which is normally happens for free to play games."" and without the loot chest rewards per level.)

I spoke to a guy that had a bad day said he lost his job so i tried with the best of my ability and skills i gained playing video games to dominate the lobby and the goods news is that we won the duo game and i and cheered him up, now we are   So a fantastic way to make friends!

It just goes to show you that we are all human, and have feelings and we dont know what happens to peoples life so for those guys that decide to be toxic with others, take a second and think about this.

16666,this game is best then overwache
16667,"I started playing the game even before the Steam, in the Steam I played a little more than 20 hours, no annoying, the developers constantly release updates and fixes, the community, in general, is adequate, although there are enough crustaceans, beeping 4 damagers, because of this, the rinks often merge. Russian Russian-speaking players, but when everything is according to the template: tank, support, flank and two damagers + there are still Russian or Russian-speaking players, that's when you get real pleasure from the game. The characters are very easy to open, to buy a regular ""pyatitysyachnik"" is enough to win a couple of skating rinks, and if you earn LVL, even less. In general, I wish the project further development, as well as the development of the Russian community, very often there is not enough someone who will understand you :D"

The champions are mostly very different from each other and the many skins make the game more enjoyable aswell . The main thing i dont like about the game is that its basically a free Overwatch  , the community can be very toxic sometimes and then you also get people trolling and AFKing , the many bugs make the game unplayable sometimes and servers are often dog shit . The game overall is worth playing. You can press f9 to see your ping and fps."

The mechanics are screwed, the game is completely unbalanced and they refuse to balance it properly, just introducing stronger and stronger champions. For the paid stuff, I don't mind having to unlock champions since they need income somehow and you can still grind them for free. HOWEVER the skins for the females are 90% just lingerie, I'm fine with seeing it but this is a kid-friendly game! It's alright to play when you need something free, but that's it."

16693,"Всем привет, давайте я разложу все плюсы и минусы игры Paladins по полочкам

Плюсы:
1. Доступна система различных сборок, я расскажу на примере: есть Инь - шикарная, добрая девочка сосочка, так и обнял бы ее ирл ( жалко, что она в игре(((( ) ее можно собрать в разные билды: фулл сап, либо дпс сап: фулл сап -хорошо лечит, дпс сап - умеет как и лечить, так и наносить нормальный урон (исцеление в данном билде слабее первого) - такие вариации можно делать практически с каждым персонажем, благодаря системе карточек (сбор билда)

2.Множество разных персонажей на разные роли, новые персонажи выходят не редко и это очень радует!

3.Возможность получать какие-либо награды за просто игры без доната и маленькая цена доната (про донат - в лайфхаке) (это будут не скины, а граффити, либо аватарки) Вставлю сюда лайфхак: если хотите купить батлпасс - проверьте акции в магазине (есть акция-набор - ты получаешь скакуна, 60к золотых и 400 гемов - за 265 рублей батлпасс ваш вместе с вышеперечисленным)

4.Личный плюс - присутствие лора (это не просто рандомные персонажи которые сражаются, а вполне связанные между собой герои, конечно есть исключения)

Минусы:
1.Англоговорящие токсики - пацан на Фернандо говорит что я мусор на Ио, отхилив 112к хп, а Серис отхилила 60к и он говорил что она топ, учитывая то, что Серис даже не взяла талант на оглушение

2.Хорошие скины находятся зачастую в дорогих сундуках, поэтому понравившийся скин будет не просто добыть (не 100%, что открыв сундук получишь тот самый скин, который хотел)

3.Визуальные баги - у героя в победном экране нет оружия, а просто руки и замыленная моделька, когда выбрал чемпиона (может быть это только у меня проблема, поэтому можете этот пункт не считать)

4.Есть имбовые чемпионы (не так много, если что), но избежать испорченной игры можно просто попросив игрока забанить имбового персонажа (ban (имя персонажа))

Я надеюсь, что вы заинтересовались данной игрой, будете играть в нее и поставите мне лайк на обзор).
На связи был Fevexa, Au Revoir!"

16700,"Simple, challenging and fun!"
16701,cock
16702,"Cool and entertaining game, I liked it a lot!!"
16703,"Good: Fun, fast paced, zero rage felt when I die for the most part. Back in the action fast. Game feels smooth to play. Having TDM as an option in an OW like game is nice. It's fun. I don't really know what more I can say with 8 hours of playtime. I got 8 hours of playtime, on a fun game, for free. It was basically a Saturday event ticket to do something fun for the day when nothing else seemed fun to play. 

Bad: LoL style ""limited hero roster that you slowly unlock"" presents a huge barrier to entry. Unlike OW you will not eventually unlock all cosmetics just by playing excessively. Loot crates for skins and you can't outright buy them. And you don't get RNG chests on ""levelup"" or anything. There's CLEARLY some balance issues with this game that they don't stay on top of the same way OW does. Buckle up for some anus puckering if you're decent at FPS games because you're gonna positively roll the level 0 players in your first dozen games and end up with a skewed af hidden MMR for non-ranked, and end up in games with smurfs and actual good players, which is lowkey horrifying when you've played like, 2 characters by that point. 

As a free game, it's really hard to say you don't recommend Paladins. 

I stayed away from this for literally years assuming it was gonna be a really generic and cheap feeling OW clone. 

It's not. 

It's not cheap feeling per se, it's more like, the same way LoL isn't exactly the most graphically stunning game ever, neither is Paladins. Doesn't mean it's bad. It's just not gonna fight with Blizzard for their level of polish. 

If nothing else Paladins is a successful distraction from the monotony of existing."
16704,"Play Ash, run the battlefield."
16705,"fun
"
16706,"I want to like this game.  I want to like it more than I like Overwatch.  

But the communication system, instead of being a radial menu, feels like entering commands into a command prompt.

There's no role queue, so even if you want to play the least popular roles (tank & healer) for the benefit of the team, there are still lobbies where people just instalock 3 healers & a tank.

The loot system is pretty dire too, with specific cosmetics only obtainable through a specific lootbox.

Lastly, the UI is overwhelmingly bad in places, with profile images that look like they've been saved in 1998 & saved so many times that the profile image is more artifact than image.

The maps are reasonably well balanced, the classes are interesting & well designed, the audio is decent.  But holy moly ,the issues I mentioned above, reaaaaally affect anybody queueing up solo.

Gotta give it a thumbs down, sorry Hi-Rez."

16726,"Paladins truly revolutionizes the hero shooter genre by having the most obtuse and nonfunctional methods of choosing what account you want to try and play on, with the risk-taking design decision of having a client that hardlocks your computer if you're so daring as to alt-tab, proving that there are some things so beyond repair even the furry mafia that you keep pandering to can't bail you out."
16727,"unbalanced crap and quite boring, I fell asleep 9 times playing the game"
16728,es un buen juego sus heroes son diferentes y divertidos de usar haiendo que haya uno para ti lo malo es lo que se tarda en desbloquearlos hacioendo que si te puedes permitirte comprar el champions pack comprale quitando eso es muy entretenido y mucha perzonalizacion al momento de usar los personajes gracias a sus barajas (llevo jugados unas 100 horas en diferentes plataformas)
16729,"Imi place acest joc,dar imi bag toata pula in el de Ruckus ca mi-a dat cosmaruri in fiecare zi pe care am jucat-o si din aceasta cauza nu mai am prieteni"
16730,a lot of fun looks a bit clunky from the outside and not expertly polished but the card system makes each character very flexible in playstyle!

16734,"Awesome game, not too hard to learn how to play, and not pay to win. There are tons of different champions with unique abilities. The only thing that is a bit annoying is that most skins/chests (all cosmetic) cost a bit more than most fps games, but other than that it's a great game, and it's free. Would definitely recommend."

16814,if you're looking for a good hero shooter to fill the ever expanding hole in your heart that the game overwatch left in you then this is a very good choice. although there are in game purchases so do most other hero shooters. all around a good game with charismatic and cute characters with a interesting ability loadout system.

I am sorry...."

16882,"I played Paladins at early Beta, took a break, then came back, then took a break, then came back. Over time, what was once a really great concept - and contender to Overwatch - became something different. It used to be I could just play casual here and there, play through some competitive if I was in the mood, and generally have a good time playing the way I wanted to play. I make it up through one of the early generations of the comp rankings and was pleased with pretty much everything about the game. Money was really only needed for cosmetics, having only to grind to unlock other characters. 
Game modes changed, and I didn't love every change. They got rid of my favorite game mode, but I could play different modes. Overall, not great changes, but not awful, either.

Regarding cosmetics... back when, if you spent real coin, you could buy exactly what you wanted from the shop, and it was great. Eventually, the cosmetic unlocks turned into loot boxes, and... yuck. All cosmetic, so thankfully not pay to win, but a step backwards, IMO. Then, the unlocks were further blocked by moving to this season pass setup, which now locked you out if you were only casual and/or didn't have or want to sink the time into earning it. As soon as this happens (other games as well, e.g. Warframe), then the game becomes a chore, and I'm done.

If you are one who can play without worrying about the cosmetics, then I really do recommend this game. As a new player, I feel like it could still be enjoyable. Coming from what the game was before... meh."
16883,Great Game

16885,"I love this game, but it literally crashes every 10 minutes for me."
16886,"I like it cause of the rich and vibrant colours and character design. I am not the best shooter player, but i enjoy learning and getting better. I will probably always get lost or back up and fall from some ledge. MOre than that. I really like to play high rez games"

Yeah, this game is great. It's by far my most played game, with almost 800 hours!
I mean, Paladins is perfect if you like Overwatch, but think Overwatch is too boring and simple.
It's is a great spin on the FPS genre since it uses a lot of Moba elements. All of the characters are customizable and fun to play! You can mix your skins, use different loadouts and Talents to make every match unique.
I really wish more people played this game though. I mean, its still playable but we'd probably get more updates if the game was more popular

16952,"lolol
"
16953,"Pros:
Lots of characters to choose from, but you don't own all of them and have to pay to get them
Weekly Rotations - Their are 4 characters everyone gets to try out
Lots of Skins for Characters
New Champion Every Month or Two
Pretty Well Balanced Besides a Few Champions
Each Champion Has 3 Talents to Choose From, Which can Completely Change The Champion
A Decent Amount of Wholesome People who Make Games Memorable
Cross-play Enabled
Not a Lot of Cheaters

Cons:
They Give Skins to a Lot of The Same Characters. For Example: Ying, Viktor, and Maeve
They Don't Fix the Bugs for A Long Time, but They Are Very Minor Bugs
The Unbalanced Characters are Insane to Play Against and Can Ruin Games
The Toxic Players are Insanely Toxic and Can Ruin Games
They only Have Three Different Game Modes, and They Probably Won't Add More For a Bit
I don't Play Ranked, But Apparently People Get Kicked a Lot From Ranked Matches
Some Characters Have Skin Locked Behind Playing/Winning Lots of Ranked Matches, Which is Bad for Some Characters Like Torvald Who Just Got A New Skin --After an Actual Year--, Which is Locked Behind Winning 100 Ranked Games in Season 4, Which is Basically Hell

False Rumors:
This game is pay to win - I can't and don't want to go into insane detail about why it isn't, but I recommend watching a video by DaddyMouse talking about it to see why it isn't a pay to win game if you want too.

Overall: 
It has a few minor problems I recommended it to anyone who likes Overwatch --In my opinion it is more fun--, although if you want to get serious in the game and play ranked you may not like it as much, cause more people are toxic and can ruin games a lot easier. Since it is free I say it is worth it, also you can get every champion if you pay a bit --you can also get a mount some crystals around 1,500 and a skin usually as well--, which is nice if you don't want to grind for a dozen years to get enough gold to buy them all. -Also some of these things also gives a discount when buying crystals in the future, which is really good if you want lots of skins."
16954,very fun alone or with friends. it has good enough balancing so that each player on each team impacts the game and no one player can carry everyone. a lot of teamwork needed to win games against good players.

17026,"As someone who gets bored of things very easily I say that this game is a very enjoyable experience. Obviously after playing a game for a while on would eventually get bored but with this game they're always adding new things and characters and there is always something to work towards. Like a character mastery, the event passes (I don't properly remember what it's called), any limited time events going on at that point, and there is even a ranked system to try and climb to the top of. So while I may have to occasionally stop playing the game for a week or so, it's still an awesome game to sit down after a long day at school and just play for hours upon end."

17032,Fun game with friends or playing solo
17033,"The game is ALWAYS crashing every 4-5 games. I even crashed twice in the same game. Absolutely horrible.
Not only that, but the loading is one of the slowest i've ever seen in modern videogames and i suspect the game's company is actually mining our data.
It's a real shame because the game is quite good."

17042,"Great game to play, problem at times is people picking characters without thinking about group makeup and ruining it. Playing ranked helps this but its not always fun to play a stressful ranked.
The gameplay is nice and fast paced with an element of  strategy too.

That was then now they seem to enjoy making random players rubberband thus making the game unplayable. There isn't any reason to it. 1 game its fine then it goes to crap and its unplayable. Even with a 200meg connection. Check all the bulletin boards this is happening to a lot of people and it will ruin the games population fast.

SORT YOUR SERVERS OUT!!!!"

17049,"Every 2nd match the game crashes without notice, until the application finally closes or puts you to a constant reconnect attempt screen that, most of the time, keeps failing until you force shut down the game and restart it。Meanwhile, it's already too late to get much fun out of the current match, because the stupid bot system auto-bought useless items already and runs into suicide by itself, being completely useless。The worst part about it is, it counts to ""your"" performance and stats。I might as well mention the wall glitches and getting idiotically stuck or rubberbanding on map structure, but those are there from the beginning… unlike the connectivity issues that appeared since late 2019。Will it ever change? Smite got those exact same connectivity issues as well, around the same time。What happened to Hi-Rez? They make a simple concept for a game graphically so pretty, but the fun ends here。I hope for the best。I don't talk to new friends about this game anymore, since I don't want them to get frustrated on those issues as well。I keep trying to play this game… I keep hoping… but I end up being annoyed again, longing for fluent entertainment, which I get by playing other games in the end, that function appropriately at least。So, no, I do not recommend this game anymore, until it gets fixed。"

17052,"worst game ever. rampant cheating. so badly so that all the cheaters claim ""i've never seen one, etc"" meanwhile you have people silent aiming on bloom champions headshotting you instantly killing you across the map frequently.

 servers are absolute dogshit and they intentinally made it so. 

hi-rez whoreing this game out like some parent whoreing out a child for money. the only thing they care about is prostituting their game out for skins. they make no effort to make it better. people are literally silent aim hacking in this game thats how bad it is. i confidently say that the cheating problem is worse than csgo.

17059,Just overall enjoyable asf
17060,"Look, this game is fun and all but the devs gave up on this game just like everything else they produced. They gave up trying. The game only reached a few seasons and they couldn't come up with anything new or exciting. This isn't my personal preference, this is what a large amount of the community things as well. 

The new champions were just using abilities from older champions and re-skinning them, the balance for this game is nonexistence, there is a surprising lack of diversity in the champions even though that was a attention grab of this game, you will find some champions unique and interesting until you realize there is another champion just like that and can do it much better. 

Back to the balancing. It was so bad. Someone was either terrible or godlike with no in between, it was so bad that the pros chose the same exact champions every single time. Speaking of pros, you will never believe what happened. They canceled their own esports. Yeah, the thing that what majority of players aim for so they could make a living, gone. It wasn't any good anyways and in the online tournaments you could tell all of them were hacking. 

Point being, the devs gave up on this game and its a shame. It is fun to play and the only game that could compete with Overwatch for this style of game. The devs just gave up, stopped listening to the constructive criticism because all they wanted was praise. They wanted it so bad, they made a council of players who had nothing but good things to say about the game and literally told people to k*ll themselves if they didn't like the game. 

Don't get this game. It is a lost cause.

17063,"Used to be an example of the Overwatch hero brawler formula done right, with a decent business model and not ran by a sub-human scum of the earth company like Blizzard. But it seems to have only got worse over time. The game is painfully slow and laggy to launch. and one of the game's currencies literally just doesn't earn properly. Features are removed, the hero pack was replaced with yet another pointless season pass to grab extra money, the people that *do* have the passes report it being unusable and 0 customer support from the company for their non-refundable purchase. Do not support these developers, because they won't support you in return."
17064,"Actually a good game that comes with many ways to have fun with your friends/ all by yourself once you understand the game itself so if you're looking for a game that offer unforgettable moments, try out Paladins.

17092,"I had an absolute blast with this game, but the more I played the more I cam into contact with the core players who were some of the saltiest, bitter people this side of League of Legends. The game itself is a lot of fun, the matches are a good length, the pool of characters is diverse and give a variety of fun ways to play. The only criticisms I can give here are a lack of game modes - there's only 3 ways to play and only one in ranked, which is pushing the cart. 

When I say I had a blast, I really mean it - I've been super addicted to this game. A game like this lives on its audio, where every tick of a crit, or boom of a kill, is rewarding - and this game does nearly as good a job as overwatch at this. (I will note on a technical level, there is a slight problem with how combat above you sounds like it's right next to you, making it harder to track vertical attacks) When you're popping off on this game, it feels great. The netcode also seems really solid, possibly due to very sizeable hitboxes - there's a lot of projectile weapons but somehow you never feel like you got cheated by lag or failing hitreg, an almost unheard of technical feat.

The game I'm describing is a pretty solid, fun time, and the first few levels were so fun. But then the game decides 'okay you're good enough to join the general population', and now you're in for it. Prepare for racism, homophobia, sexism, and 'ironic' variants of the above. Get ready for insults and trash talk and harassment because you picked the wrong tank or healer, when you were the last to pick and everyone else instalocked dps assassin types, but YOU'RE the problem. I had a game where I was second healer on a team that constantly said they were getting no healing and threatening to report us, spamming 'good game!' 'cancel that!', saying they're throwing because we're throwing, saying okay cya I don't wanna play with these healers (at the end we had a combined 180k healing, an absurdly high amount, and won). This was on casual quick play. Ranked is considerably worse. I did my 5 placement games on ranked, and 4 of them were extreme stress situations, mostly due to my teammate's harassment. Every decision I made was wrong, and I'm constantly second guessing myself or playing stuff I don't know to appease these terrible people. This is also in part due to the bizarrely wide range in the matchmaking for those games - on my fourth placement match someone in the other team had 'season 3 grandmaster' in their title - in what world does someone on their 4th placement match with I think 5 days of playing the game go against that?

The experience of the general population of the game is.. hostile. No-one is having fun. My advice is to not play the game in the first place, so you don't get the initial addiction, so you don't end up there. I hope these people find some solace."
17093,good
17094,"Over 1k hours later, and I still hate this game, still fun tho."

17101,"Game is exceedingly buggy. Promises and expectations are broken constantly. Their support feature is atrocious. They close unresolved tickets constantly. For one, I find the need to submit tickets for problems in this game easily 3x more than any other game I've played. And when you do, you get a ""please be patient, we may need extra time to get back to you"", and if they don't respond quickly enough. They close the ticket on you. They also close the ticket on you when they feel like it randomly between messages. They don't even always tell you when doing this. They don't always give you the items you paid for. And when following through with support tickets for this, they also will just close them mid conversation before resolved. I can even believe that this level of customer experience exists. I am blown away by their not caring to stabalize their game, and their user account website. And by their treatment to users who would have otherwise been fine dealing with the jankiness if they treated you like a decent human. I can ONLY believe this same lack of polish and treatment of their users translates to ALL HiRez games. What an experience!"

17110,If you think Paladins is like Overwatch you aren't sorely mistaken. Paladins is closer to smite than any other game yet it keeps itself apart from other games by allowing you to fully customize how your character plays. Not just through the item buy system in the matches but also by choosing subclasses and building different decks for your characters.
17111,It is a great game that is better than overwatch and most of its genre

17117,"So as people say this is just another TF2 or Overwatch, not gonna lie to you, its surprisingly different from what you'd expect, it's filled with unique characters of different difficulties and they all have abilities that part them from each other.

the game itself is both balanced and fun and you'll always find a way to have a blast in it! The community on the other hand could be more fun but you're not here to make friends are you? you're here to destroy noobs like the champion you were meant to be.

Personally i love this game because of its variety of characters and fun maps! There are character rotations and the heroes cost but that's not a reason to ditch this game! It's a hidden gem and definitely worth a try.

I recommend this game and i'm definitely gonna keep playing this.

rating it: 10/10"
17118,good game
17119,"Good fun and very addicting. 
OH.... and the matchmaking in terms of being well balanced... Yes the developers really know how to balance for an enjoyful experience. I just started this game and I have never ran into a full team of level 300's ... SAID NO MAN EVER. Yes, if you smelt sarcasm you are right. 
On rainy days when you are trying to master a champion, prepare to have level 300 Fernandos' backed up by a master team taunt and laugh at you as they yeet the objective to victory as your team grasps for a single shot on a sweaty bouncing Maeve. Then the whole esports enemy team will leave objective to come up to your base spawn door ready to farm damage of your wretched corpse... until you finally die a noble hero or live long enough to see yourself become an AFK player on spawn until the suffering is over.
It is a wonderful game though. you will enjoy finding and adjusting to your preferred champions. During daytime when fresh meat is on, you'll have an enjoyful experience. But when it reaches after hours when veterans come to play... hide under a table and pray to the Magistrate for balancing to be fixed or stare into the Abyss for eternity."
17120,"Is the game a OW Clone?
-Yes
Is it a GOOD OW Clone?
-Yes

My only problem is that it feels P2W for a new player because of the champion disadvantage. Luckily, you CAN earn gold in-game to unlock these characters BUT its a grind. Luckily you have some well balanced Champions that you can use for F2P. I definitely recommend trying it if you like OW"

17136,"20/04/2021

Pros:
Fun FPS, even more fun with friends
Able to choose which region to queue
Champion abilities customization (add stats towards a champion's abilities)
Super optimized, high fps.
Fast quickmatch games, fast loading times.

Cons:
Servers can get laggy (people shoot through walls)
Gold is quest and first game reliant (hard to grind gold after completing them)
Champions cost too much. (average 200-300 gold per game, most champions 60k gold)
Most skins are locked behind chests or old battle passes. (cannot purchase directly)

17146,nope
17147,"As I've thought more and played this game more, the less and less I seem to enjoy it. The characters are very linear and don't have a lot of depth most of the time. There are loads of bugs that make the game not very enjoyable, which when paired with the hard CC (e.g., roots) and light CC (e.g., slows), this game makes me quit out of the actual game every match. Matches are a stomp most of the time, either for your side or the other's side. Overall after a bit more time, the lack of a solid story or campaign (the story within this game may as well not exist for how vapid it is at the moment) makes this game plain boring after some time. The horrendous grind for the characters or skins must be expressed, as if you started recently or are wanting to start, I'd highly recommend against this, due to how slow the current system is. 

Simply put, in my opinion there are better alternatives for this sort of genre out on the market like Overwatch (albeit this does cost money), Team Fortress 2, etc."
17148,
17149,"Decent game, but gets bogged down by bad design decisions.
 It has good pace, the shooting feels decent in some heroes, and terrible in others. Hero design is a hit and miss, with some having a lot of personality in first person, while others feeling cumbersome. Some feel awesome to play, while others feel like you are only sitting idle clicking. It obviously rips off a lot of Overwatch kits, but actually I wish they had ripped the off a lot more, so they'd be more fun to play.
 The card system is actually one of the good design decisions. It allows you to customize how you play. Sadly that's one of the few things done without issues. Maps are way to big, so they had to implement a garish mount (which of course is monetized heavily), and in the siege mode, you have to travel a lot to get back to the fight, maps also lack any personality, if you play one, you've played them all. 
Matchmaking is broken, either you fight against a really bad team, or you are in the extremely bad team, almost never its a fun, well matched game. You barely get any reward for winning or losing a match, and if you want any specific skin, be ready to dish out a lot of money. Overall, I'd say this is the worst part of it all. I could overlook most of the other bad design decisions if I felt like playing was rewarding, or you had any sort of progression. But they had to lock it out behind and absurdly high pay wall."
17150,Addictive. I advise to get the started pack to start playing

17152,game i really gun when you r board as hell

17154,"It's a great alternative to Overwatch with a few key differences that make it a refreshing experience. Not a perfect game, due to many bugs and balancing issues, but very fun and easy to drain many hours into. The community, especially in ranked, can be VERY toxic but with a simple click of the mute button the problem goes away. Even more fun with friends!"

The reason is supposedly, that I would have more 'seeing' advantage than 16:9 ratio-players. Well bad news, every competitive title has 21:9 support (I am not even mentioning, that those titles have worldwide tournaments and massive playerbase).

So, never again. Farewell.
Sincerely, Ultrawide-Master-Race."
17176,"Update: Much has changed over the years in this game since 2017. I no longer recommend this game. It is dying, the matchmaking is absolutely awful unless you have experienced players all in a party of 4-5 people (Aussie servers). Currently SEA servers are completely broken and unplayable, and the Paladins 'Team' are extremely bad at confronting any community feedback regarding bugs. This is a cashgrab game, which I will no longer be supporting. 

It is sad to have to change this review, as I used to love the characters and gameplay, but now it is clear they are not listening to the community and as one developer put in a stream ""You don't know what you want"". 
Some of the front facing developers are also fairly creepy, and I hope that nobody under 18 interacts with them outside of the public view. (Based on latest showcase comments regarding new champion release.)

Do yourself a favour and look elsewhere for a free game, otherwise you will regret it."

17193,"I decided to install this game because I saw a Vtuber play it (Hololive EN's Amelia Watson).

I used to play Overwatch a LOT, I mean, I had like several hundred hours in the game, got fairly close to hitting GM in S3 and just gradually fell out of love with that game. The balance was whack, and people just didn't die after the turbo healers came out then that reinvented the 3-3 meta (GOATS) that ruined the game for most people you and I probably know.

Something about this game doesn't scream balanced to me, but playing it has been way more enjoyable for me. I used to think this game was a knock-off OW, but playing it is like, I just take my skills from playing Overwatch and Apex (the latter which I still play) and have a blast on fun DPS-centric champions. I'm not sure what it is I like about the game, but it's definitely way more fun than most people will ever know. 

Champs are fun, different, have build expression (something I hate about League, even tho I play it, but love about Dota 2) and I just like the vibes this game gives off. I don't play Smite, I'm not a Hi-Rez fan and I'm still bitter about Tribes. This game is just well-rounded and unironically more fun than OW for a lapsed OW diehard fan. I play a lot of Apex currently, and I just take the tracing skills I get in that game and go on Skye and absolutely fry lobbies, it's so fun. The progression of this review is completely random but playing this game this past week has felt like how coming to terms with Apex replacing PUBG in my life felt, except now it's Paladins replacing Overwatch. And I've actually sold friends on installing and playing with me too, so that's awesome. 

I thought it would be SUUPER grindy to get new champs, but it's honestly not that bad, I've played way grindier (Siege for instance) and I get a new champ a day if I play for like two hours (which is pretty ez considering all my uni classes are online). 

I'm getting off track but, it's just really good. 

Seris/Skye/Zhin/Khan main btw =).

Glad I checked it out.

17196,"It's kinda like overwatch, but not as toxic.  I played over watch for a little bit but I enjoy the diversity in this game along with the fact that i'm not getting cussed out for simple mistakes.  The characters or 'champions' have tons of detail and an abundance of skins, mounts, and more."
17197,my nutsack
17198,"tl;dr, ""Pretty solid game - fun to play. Although lore's a bit iffy and some bugs here and there. Def recommend tho""




Paladins is a free-to-play team-based shooter where utilizing abilities to annihilate your enemy is the core mechanic of the game. Your goal is to capture an objective and push a cart to the enemy base to win. Very similar to several hit games of the genre, Team Fortress and Overwatch.  It's a solid competitor on the market and capable of guaranteeing many hours of fun. Honestly, coming from an older player, it's certainly very interesting to see how the game developed over time. 

---{Aesthetics}---
☐ You forget what reality is
☐ Beautiful
☑Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Paint.exe

From an aesthetics standpoint, over the years Paladins has maintained its cartoon-like graphic style. The colourful characters are eye-catching, they're well modeled and easily distinguishable from the background scenery. The characters, map, GUI all compliment the visual style Hi-Rez was going for. All-in-all Paladins offers solid, consistent and appealing graphics. And honestly, with the new map revamps, the aesthetics are consistently improving.

---{Gameplay}---
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ It‘s just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Starring at walls is better
☐ Just don‘t

As a MOBA and FPS junky, i'm really impressed by the gameplay. The best part about the gameplay is that Paladins allows you to truly find and choose your playstyle. Whether it's reducing cooldown times on key abilities or increasing the range or duration of your movement, Paladins really allows you to customize your champion in ways no game has ever done before. The only downside is that the newer champions lack creativity in their abilities and some cards are pretty much useless. 

---{Bugs}---
☐ Never heard of
☐ Minor bugs
☑ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs 


Bugs, Bugs. Bugs. The biggest issue and the biggest source of complaint. This game has a sizeable amount of bugs and it seems as if the devs are consistently patching them. Some updates you get these minor bug fixes when the major bugs are just glaring. The biggest issue i see stems from the introduction of new skins and battle-passes which are seemingly prioritized over bug fixes and polishing. That left the game in a pretty sad state. 

PS there's definitely been an improvement.

---{Lore}---
☐ It‘ll replace your life 
☐ Lovely
☐ Good
☐ Average
☑ Below Average
☐ Text or Audio floating around
☐ There's lore?

The lore's pretty questionable. At this point it's likeL

Magiastrarete Badad, Paldiasn Go0d x3)d)D, also angel and tiem travel and god stuff fite boom WOOOO

Very messy, very confusing, the characters backstories are pretty iffy too, some characters were pretty much abandoned completely, like wtf happened between Andro and Lex no mention except that one became bad?? I know Hi-Rez can make pretty good lore. Smite is a perfect example of that. Hope to see an improvement sometime.




Overall, Paladins is a solid game. Definitely should try. Every game has it's issues here and there. I know i didn't cover every pro and every con about this game but i've played quite a bit. Just felt obligated to leave a review :VVV"
17199,unbalenced most of the time but fun asf
17200,it's like overwatch before they added the stupid role bullcrap
17201,"so nice

17228,bro actuall aids. 10/10
17229,fire
17230,and i thought overwatch's game balance was bad.
17231,"Got back into playing it after not playing it in a while (played it on PS4 before getting a decent PC) and although I do enjoy it, it's another game Hi-Rez has basically killed. Hi-Rez has a habit of putting out great games with an enthusiastic community and that are loved, but then killing it themselves and moving onto a new game.

Hi-Rez killed eSports for this title instead of trying to fix the issues, changes made to the game now are purely for cosmetic instead of fixing issues.

Sad because I don't really enjoy Overwatch that much and much prefer Paladins."

17254,"if you are looking for a great pvp game then this is one of many you should have , iv game to this game later than most and me and my friend love every second of it with minor rages due to skill gaps but it only helps you get better at these kinda game and every champion is unique and has a different style to play as my personal favorite is vora since you need to be aggressive and flank mid fight. so i recommend you get this if you are looking for a time waster , game with your mates to play or just a new game to play"

17277,"Quite awesome game. Noob friendly with well made tutorial and matches with bots at the beginning. Learning abilities is fun, shooting is even more fun. Maps are well designed and very nice to look at, same thing with heroes designs. Tried it only as a casual though so I have no idea how competetive part of the game looks. Anyway, Paladins is fun, my first hero shooter. I prefer solo online fps experience but this is still ok for me."
17278,"Realy fuuny game

17285,"Its actually a really fun game, but most of the time youll end up with bad teammates, so youll have to carry everybody. If you play with friends that understand this game, its actually pretty fun. Also the scalling in this game is crap, because you could be level 20 and end up with level 200 enemys. A lot people also sweat like crazy in this game. I would rate this game a 4 out of 10."
17286,yes
17287,"gute spiel yasellme
"
17288,WHERE'S THE STRAIGHT PRIDE? ARE WE NOT ALLOWED TO BE PROUD?
17289,"To sum this up, the community is dead and the only way to play the game is in a five stack since the match making is terrible. 

The game has lost much of its older player base and retains very little of its new players. If your new you will be placed against a lot of smerfs trying to avoid stacks, therefore many new players get wrecked in the early paladins career. If you mange to stay around you will continuously play against the same players; however the problem here is that many of the more experienced players only play in a stack with other experienced players because they are tired of loosing matches due to being the placed in teams with players that throw or are far less experienced. This makes the game impossible to play and enjoy while solo queuing or partying with at least 4 ppl. 

Meanwhile, the rest game feels like the devs have given up. There are many bugs which likely will never be fixed, rather then fix the bugs hirez removes the content causing the bugs like kill cams.  Additionally new content is rare because the devs tend to just slightly alter old features. For instance, there hasn't been a new map release almost 2 years in siege and even longer
 for any of the other modes.  Additionally, creative different game modes are never introduced anymore.  Champs are released on a regular basis, but they don't fundamentally change the game so you are stuck with the same monogamous gameplay with the unbearably bad match making. To make matters worse there is no longer a pro Paladins game scene or even a grand masters title, so there is nothing to aspire to while playing this game. 


In all, paladins even free is a rip off. You would be better off looking at the other free to play games out there."
17290,Really great game! Especially for budget gamers. Really addicting. Fun to play with friends. Recomend to anyone who wants to download this game!

17319,"ótimo game com muitos problemas internos por conta da empresa que o criou. Voltei a jogar em 2021 e posso dizer que vale muito a pena. 
Pontos positivos:
+Muitos players. Sempre acha partidas em inúmeros modos de game e com maior frequência que Overwatch. 
+Muitos campeões diferentes para selecionar. Cada um com suas particularidades, o que torna o game com uma longevidade absurda se parar para aprender cada campeão. 
+Boa performance para PCs low-end.
+Intuitivo e simples para quem é novo aprender o que cada coisa faz.
 Agora os negativos:
-Muito grind para adquirir novos campeões
-Não me importo com micro-transações de skins, mas a Hi-rez está cobrando uma facada e meia por cada skin de cada champ.
-Bugs e bugs de textura são bem comuns principalmente se mudar configurações de textura.
As vezes os personagens ficam presos dentro do spawn sem poder passar a barreira no modo tradicional do game e etc.
Não acontecem com frequência, mas quando ocorre é bem irritante. 
-Hit-box para cada champ não foi bem trabalhado. Muito das vezes tu acerta e é acertado em locais que não deveriam. 
- Esse provavelmente é o mais grave: a comunidade. A comunidade não é muito boa, muita gente é extremamente tóxica e parece que a grande maioria tá jogando TDM. Não tem interesse de jogar em equipe e ajudar. Não me importo com gente quebrando a comp e pegando 4 champs de damage. Mas se tu for fazer isso ou sup de dmg... tenta tipo.. DAR DAMAGE! A grande maoiria NÃO faz a sua parte e depois fica ofendendo no chat. Normalmente ser tão tóxico quanto eles resolve, mas tem muita gente que fica desmotivada e etc então fica ai essa observação."

17325,yes
17326,Very good. yes I like very much hmm yes
17327,I stopped playing cause it used to be good but it would seem the team no longer cared about the average player and had only embraced the meta and instead of making any improvements on the game like upgrading textures/fixing bugs they had just been adding more and more skins that are like 15$ a piece. None the less it would seem they have been slowly fixing that and they have even gotten me back into the game.

17341,sweet
17342,"Basically what Overwatch wishes it could be in everything except polish (they always have a little kink here and there that needs working out). You can play every champion in a myriad of different ways, with the tools they offer you to fine-tune their kit, sometimes to the point where the champion completely changes their role. And they're absolutely viable!

The players you encounter can sometimes be nerve-wreckingly dense, with some matches hinging on which team has the higher number of chromosomes, but with some friends you meet, it's a sinch, and it's worth it for those few sweaty matches where every single person is absolutely ascended and playing optimally with skills they didn't know they had, fighting toe-to-toe, just waiting for the other to falter, seeing who can stay in the flow longer.

Would recommend to everyone 9/10"
17343,Total crap of a game. Theres a delay for damage register and ability usage. And after last update there are 2 days of non stop server maintenance - cant even play. Not fun!

First and foremost the MATCHMAKING, which is so unfair and unjust... you keep getting a team of BOTs and carrying them to win which next to impossible against a strong opposition team. Second, Hirez studios has this high ping during the game which either can lead to game crash or puts you next to the walls where you can’t even move... Moral after loving and playing this game for more than a year and half, “PALADINS IS NO LONGER A TEAM GAME”... one of the worst and degraded and disliked game ever in the history...Shame on you guys who created this game...Poor and pathetic game."

17386,"JUST LIKE SMITE BUT WORST, HI-REZ AT IT'S WORST

It's more unbalanced, the tanks and assassins are shamelessly OP, some seem to take no damage and have no cool downs, they're just standing in the middle of the objective shooting non-stop, damage dealers do no damage, but man do they die fast, being a med is even more useless than in Smite. the playerbase is way too dumb, no one apparently understand what an objective is, everyone plays like every match is a TDM, just stand back and snipe, screw capturing, half the people have no intention of ever capturing, they just stand back and defend, so you really have no hope of winning since they'll never will try to actually capture the objective, they're just as happy losing and waiting for the enemy near our base.
Also there's way too much spawn camping, there's people who know who the OP characters are and use them to sit outside the spawn killing you as you walk out."

Unlike most people, I played the Henry Stickmin Collection with no prior experience with any of the flash games that make up this series. I have never once played one of these games, and my only real exposure to it was watching a YouTuber I like play ""Stealing the Diamond"" about three years ago. So, I don't have any nostalgia tinted goggles influencing me here.

So, what do I think? The Henry Stickmin Collection is incredible. These games are so much fun, they're wacky, and they make choice based elements and quick time events, two gameplay elements that are usually shoehorned into games as cheap gimmicks, actually fun. And that's all the gameplay that there is!

There are 6 main stories that you go through here. They start off shorter, and get progressively more involved with each entry. If I had to choose one as my favorite, it would definitely be Completing the Mission, which is the last game in the Collection, made exclusively for it, and by far the largest and most passionately created.

There are a ton of achievements, 82 in all, which aren't super challenging to do, but take time, and are random and fun. Bios, information about the random characters, are collectibles that you receive for right-clicking on each character that you come into contact with. I personally enjoyed this aspect of the game, as I like collectibles, and found the bio descriptions hilarious and full of humorous references (which describes the game as a whole.

The only bad thing I have to say about this game would be the bugs. First of all, the game, by default, plays in small window. You can turn on fullscreen, but when you do, you get a warning message that this makes the game unstable, and prone to freezing and crashing. I can confirm that this is definitely the case, as I had my game crash about once every 20 minutes. It's not that big a deal, as you can just restart it, and you don't lose progress, but it's very annoying. That's the most important thing that the developers absolutely NEED to fix!

Second, there are times in the animation where the frame rate just plummets for a couple of seconds for no reason. It's not always in the same spot either, because if you come back later and replay that scene, it will work fine. It appears to just be poor optimization, and should also be addressed.

Other than that, I can't say anything bad about this game. I absolutely loved it, and I think fans of this series, or people who like quirky indie games in general, will get a lot of enjoyment out of this!

I personally don't think $15 is too high a price for this game, as it really is a quality game. Some people seem to think that if you don't get a certain number of hours of entertainment out of a game, that it isn't worth the money. I don't necessarily agree, because I think shorter titles that maintain a high and consistent quality experience for 10 hours are far more worth the money than one where half of the gameplay is busy work for 40 hours. Regardless, if you don't think 10 hours of gameplay is enough to warrant a $15 purchase, then I'd recommend you wait for a sale. I can easily see this going for $5 during a holiday sale.

I hope you found this review helpful! Please leave me a rating, and give me your thoughts in the comments, as I would love to hear feedback, ideas, and what personal experiences you've had with this title.

I also made a video review below. If you'd like more spoiler-free thoughts on the game, check it out:"

17420,i hate it
17421,poo
17422,LOL ;)
17423,"I hate this game with a burning passion, 279 hrs"
17424,"Normally I would think people post Pros and Cons for a game and let you decide if you want to play the game or not but I like this game and want you to have the full context If i can fit it in.
First I would like to say that I have played quite a few PvP games in my time (as many as a sweaty hormone filled teenager in his mom's basement you say? oh no no. Just enough to say I have) and despite all the unique mechanics I've seen get backed by million dollar publishers and AAA+ gaming studios, this game stands out as being one of the most well balanced PvP games I have ever played. 
Let's take Overwatch for example (the game Paladins is often compared to). I certainly wouldn't be the only one in saying that Overwatch's balance is horrendous. Blizzard seems to shit themselves at hearing the word ""nerf"" and will only buff, whereas Hi-Rez understands and hears their community out on what the issues at hand are, nerfing problematic parts of characters as needed. This is SO VERY CRUCIAL when it comes to balancing, looking at the numbers at hand, while still keeping an ear open to the community and what they have to say about something that feels busted. Hi-Rez, to me, has proven (albeit slowly) that they are willing to make educated decisions on balancing solutions, showing care towards the better health and longevity for their game. Ironic considering Hi-Rez provides free to play PvP games, and many gaming studios like that publish AAA+ 60$ games just. Don't. fucking. care. about. the. balancing.
There are also lots of in-game balancing things that is there that is really nice. If a character uses an Ultimate ability, a voice line plays right before across the whole map so everyone knows. And every Ult lasts a max of 5 seconds. The snipers in the game require at least two fully charged sniper rounds to kill enemies, so no-one shot cheap crap like that. Most maps are very similar to each other so characters don't feel anymore powerful on one map then a different map. There are 4 classes: Damage, Flank, Frontline, Healer. If the teams remain even with these classes filled, it will feel like a rather fair fight for the most part. For the most part.....
Now for the balance problem this game faces and will most likely continue to face. The hitboxes are pillshaped, and in no way accurate to the character model it follows. And there are hitscan characters in this game. Many, many hitscan characters. These characters with hitboxes that large don't exactly require that much accuracy, making them feel rather braindead to play, and frustrating to play against. DPS is also EXTREMELY valued in this game, as many characters suffer with high consistent DPS issues (this relates to the hitscan problem, but many burstfire/projectile characters also have this issue). You will see players damage stacking characters before they pick a frontline to tank damage, despite the fact that regular formation betters the odds of winning. This is common in just about any PvP game however, because why have fun with a fair back and forth fight when you can bring a braindead amount of damage and nuke the other team like douchebags?
Regardless, the community for this game is relatively quieter then a decent amount of PvP games i've played, but you'll hear some toxic crap, it's inevitable, people get sweaty and salty and they start cussing your mom out with the N-word, you know how it goes. But there is a report system in the game, just report em and hope they get banned. It's a decent community otherwise, I wouldn't let the community be the deciding factor in playing this game. There are dozens of characters, you are bound to find a few you like to play, there are some REALLY nice creative skins, and the types of ways for playing each character are endless because of the decks you can make and the perks you can buy in-match. Want to play a Tank but would rather flank? No problem, just grab the ""Nimble"" perk and away you go! 
To shorten things up, this is the game Overwatch should have been. It's off the rails with it's characters but the train still manages to chug along with its ability to correctly time and balance all of its insanity.
It's not perfect, but hey, it's free. Don't like it? Uninstall."
17425,Matchmaking is broken
17426,"Good game. Obviously very similar to Overwatch. But at least to me, it has a better feel to it."
17427,"It's a good time waster, but otherwise not enjoyable"
17428,Amazing game love it.
17429,"WELL LETS SEE HERE  why do you money, if you want to come in my money? its just like Soooo true"

17434,love it
17435,.
17436,"The game isn't spectacular or ground breaking but it is fun.  This is a great cross platform game to play when you are tired of playing everything else.  If you have family or friends that only play on console, this is great game to get everyone together without having to spend a lot of money."
17437,just play overwatch lol
17438,Cool game but farts

17462,.
17463,Honestly the dumbest thing to watch is my friends who are all in their late 20s + 30s play against a bunch of 13 year olds winning every match.  If you want to think you're good at a game go fight all these kids.  If you want to actually have a challenge and better mechanics across every board play literally any other game.
17464,Almost like over watch I wish the battle pass was better but overall decent game.
17465,Amazing
17466,Free overwatch i dont like copycats
17467,"Good game, I recommend. I been playing since ob 64 and im big pro and ez claps win and fun when nubs mad."
17468,great game and no monthly charge.
17469,"Some characters in this game feel like garbage to play but when you find one you like they are some of the most fun you can have in a shooter. There also seems to be endless improvement you can do in this game so I see myself playing and learning stuff well into 1,000 hours in. The card system allows you to build characters however you want so if you want to play a speedy vora that just jukes and dodges every attack you can try to build around that. Try it you got nothing to lose."
17470,"Has serious balancing issues. Instead of fixing bugs and making balancing changes, they add more characters to hope that it fixes itself. Do better."
17471,pretty kool gaem in my opinion
17472,good game
17473,the games is horrible when your friends throw on purpose
17474,Overwatch but free and it's awesome

17480,"I was told by a friend that this game is like garfield kart but with guns but little to my dismay there was no garfield themed modes,characters,gun skins,etc its a real shame because i would of really enjoyed this game is it even just had a small garfield  themed event"

17485,gud
17486,Honestly really fun and its a good change up from all the other PVP games
17487,fun game until someone doesnt pick a tank and a healer.
17488,"i love this game
"
17489,"Good game overall! Has a few bugs and glitches here and there as well as the occasional server crash but the game is fun. Characters are pretty balanced with the exception of the newest one always being busted and subsequentially nerfed. Gameplay is enjoyable and strategic. If you want a more sophisticated overwatch, you will like this game for its talents and cards systems that add an extra layer of strategy and depth to the genre."
17490,"Omg!! This game is sooo goood, like if you want a free overwatch this is your game!!!! Honestly, I think this game is better than overwatch!!"

17511,nice alternative to overwatch more slow paste
17512,This game is the definition of a good webcam mic... you're surprised how okay it is for a webcam mic. (10/10 slightly recommend)
17513,"The game became a lot more fun recently and evolved from being just an Overwatch clone tbh, Just needs a bit more players in the higher ranks and it will be near perfect"
17514,This is probably one of the most unbalanced games i've ever played if you want to play a game where you can get two shot from across the map go ahead and be my guest.
17515,probably the best game ever #paladinswasfirst #fuckoverwatch

17517,fun free to play game.
17518,good
17519,tolol
17520,One of my favorite games ! 👍
17521,"I cannot lie, this game reminds me a LOT of Overwatch. Which I don't really mind. It's got a different concept behind it, but it's pretty sick. I definitely recommend if you are new to PC gaming and want something that's free to play."
17522,watchover

17526,"The best 1st person shooter game I've ever played besides Valorant.
I don't know why people compare this game to overwatch but it's totally different in a whole level except for defending a certain point.
Gameplay wise everybody will love it.


I also love the concept of siege. 
Monthly new heroes, updates and battle pass are awesome. 
Non toxic community unlike other 1st person shooter games

I give this 5/5. I hope the game gets what it deserves

17528,yes
17529,Not bad
17530,If you want to sink time into a game i would pick paladins. for a long term game to try-hard in its not quite suitable due to the overpowered or lack of balance mixed with some game-play issues. But mostly this game was enjoyable and i would definitely play it again.

-It's a free but still fun and competitive copy of overwatch
I would recommend it obviously because it's free, it's fun (specially with friends) and it's actually a good game. Difficult to understand at first if you don't have any experience, but in a way that you want to learn more of it."

17554,"The servers are just bad. The hitbox is broken. The devs are only thinking aubout makeing everyone a furry. It started good, it had big maps, and was original at some points (with the crad system etc.) but they removed everything. It could have been good but it isnt, it may become good but I think its to late for some players (Not that it matters there are still getting money out of it).

Solution for all Problems: Make Paladins 2 (just copy paste) and then make Paladins 3."

17601,"Introduction

There is nothing quite as satisfying as blasting the entire enemy team off the stage with Torvald’s hyper beam. Reanimating after you die as Terminus and vaporizing any opponents too slow to get away never gets old, and seeing Willo’s multiplying seedling attack come your way inspires horror. But the greatest achievement is that Paladins: Champions of the Realm allows you to dictate your playstyle.Paladins empowers experimentation and true customization. Amid the thrilling battles is a diverse five-on-five hero shooter that puts the power of choice front and centre. Whether it’s the wonderfully imagined characters, the in-depth card and item customization systems, or the inoffensive free-to-play model, there are plenty of options that make Paladins a worthy competitor for Overwatch.

The Game

There are 36 Champions in the game, few are unlocked when you start playing the game for first time and rest you have to unlock yourself. There are several types of characters. I found Seris to be a very interesting character given her abilities are too addictive that I always want to play her. I also liked the Bomb King , as the name suggest it is a living bomb that throws explosives to stun the enemies. 
It is a team shooter with three main game modes and a wide range of quirky heroes to choose from. Initially, you have access to a limited range of heroes (more unlock as players gain experience), each with a unique set of skills which can be amplified before the match by a customizable “loadout” of ability cards. There are 36 Champions in the game, few are unlocked when you start playing the game for first time and rest you have to unlock yourself. There are several types of characters. I found Seris to be a very interesting character given her abilities are too addictive that I always want to play her. I also liked the Bomb King , as the name suggest it is a living bomb that throws explosives to stun the enemies Players join a team with four other squamates to make a balanced team of damage-dealers, defenders, front-liners, flankers, and support units to take on an opposing team of heroes. The game offers three modes: Siege, (payload capture and movement) Onslaught, (point capture and kill count) and Deathmatch (first to forty kills wins.) Heroes earn currency during matches, which can be spent on useful powerup items during the match.  Post-match, players earn experience points and in-game currency, and unlock additional heroes and skill cards. Once players unlock twelve heroes and raise their player profile to level fifteen, they unlock Competitive mode, which lets them join ranked battles and grants them leader board status 
Every player picks five out of 16 cards to create a pre-set loadout tailored to the champion you choose that enhances stats and moves during a match. Beyond that, every match begins with yet another set of options, allowing you to pick one out of four champion-specific Talents that will dramatically change the way that character plays. Cassie, for instance, is a damage champion who wields a crossbow and generally works great from a farther distance, but this can all swiftly change with the swap of a Talent.
Cards and Talents are picked and locked in at the start of each match, but Paladins continues to let customization dominate the playing field even when the action is in full swing. Credits earned throughout a battle let you buy items to further boost stats and influence your abilities.
Each mode is able to stay fresh and interesting thanks to the 16 maps that are tactically compatible with their assigned game mode. My favourite is Jaguar’s Falls.

My Favourite Features of this Game

This fun team-based shooter uses a cute visual style and emphasizes competition over gore, which keeps players coming back round after round. Paladins: Champions of the Realm has a Disney-like art style that slightly lessens the fear of competition with fun, attractive heroes, a quick tutorial, and practice matches against forgiving AI opponents. Gameplay is immediately fun, even when you're still learning the game and getting accustomed to each character's abilities. See, there are lots of options for heroes, weapons, skills, and items, and players who know how to combine them become extremely powerful. The more experience you have, the cooler heroes you unlock. Still, even when you're just starting, out you can have a blast.
Cool themed maps give you plenty of strategic options, and the quirky heroes have powerful, often hilarious weapons. An almost-instant respawn when you die makes the pace of the game crazy-fast, and a wide range of unique hero powers keeps fights unpredictable. If buying item upgrades during matches confuses you, a convenient ""auto-purchase"" button solves that problem, and if your teammates get too bossy or rude, you can disable voice chat in the Options menu. Playing matches levels up your player profile, which means access to more modes, heroes, items, and skill cards, and special events occur periodically so you can earn even more unique items like character skins and emotes. The sound in Paladins: Champions of the Realm is nice, with upbeat music and funny character quips, and aside from the occasional busty beauty, the art and bloodless effects are colourful and kid-friendly. Player chat and voice add-ons remain a concern of course, when it comes to language, bullying, and potential predators, and the in-game shop is likely to be a constant temptation. But in terms of gameplay though, Paladins: Champions of the Realm is a quality team shooter -- one competitive kids are bound to enjoy.
As a free-to-play game, it’s always a concern that microtransactions could cause a pay to win, but Paladins keeps things on the level by not offering any competitive advantage for sale. Gold currency is earned by playing matches and completing quests, and using it to buy locked champions gives you a decent window of time to master a character as you save up for the next purchase. The entire selection of characters is available for purchase in a pack, and many cool outfits and other cosmetics can be purchased individually so you’re not left waiting for the item you want to drop from a loot box – though you can buy a loot box for a cheaper price if you don’t mind going through a handful of emotes and sprays. The Battle Pass costs 500 crystals ($10, more or less) and is a nice way to continue unlocking skins and chests.

Final Verdict

Personally, I feel  Paladins’ scope for experimentation is its greatest strength. The Developers have done an excellent job to make this competitive game filled with fun and creativity. The sound , graphics and characters , all are on spot. Whether it’s the main mode that encapsulates the teamwork aspect or the character designs that immediately flow with creativity, Paladins: Champions of the Realm clearly stands out in the midst of competitive multiplayer shooter games.

17619,"This is one of the games that I've ended up playing the most, it's a must get, its free, the one part about the game that is a 'problem' is all the skins that they add that they want you to purchase, it seems like they shove it in your face almost all the time. If you can get past that it should be a blast"
17620,ayyyy
17621,fun
17622,I LIKE THE GAME
17623,good
17624,there is jiggle
17625,It just really fun to hear the damage sounds as well as the customizing you can do to each character to fit more to your playstyle. Strat crafting in this game with my friends is the most fun ive had in a free game in a loooong time.
17626,it is good and funny game
17627,"Matchmaking needs fixing BADLY. It prioritises fast queue times way too far over finding a remotely even team MMR, so many games are complete stomps where one team is a 3/4/5 stack ex platinum team on discord and the other are 2 bots, 2 noobs sucking their toes all game and you."
17628,"This game is good ...  there are many bugs in this game . 
You need proper teammates to play this game , and i have no friends 😪😪😪"
17629,paladinos is very fun. i like healing poggers

17631,Really reccomend it. Fun game.
17632,yes
17633,I enjoy the fast-paced and exciting nature of this game.  I also like that the rounds are short.
17634,nice
17635,"Bad community, no one was to choose a tank or healer and everyone thinks they can out-damage the damage roles by going flank. It's basically overwatch with card collecting features and retards."
17636,..
17637,prettttttttttty funnnnnnnnnnnnnn <3
17638,nisin my ass mastercall
17639,It's a Good game very similar to Overwatch so if u do not afford games this is a game for you :)
17640,"yup I recommend it
It's even more fun than overwatch if you play it for a while 
but they kinda fucked up by adding yagorath ngl"
17641,İ like this game im addicted to it and it pretty good
17642,"This game is an excellent alternative to Overwatch. I mean, what's not to like it's free it has most of the aspects that make Overwatch well Overwatch, but Paladins shouldn't be regarded just as the free alternative to Overwatch but, instead, should be praised as one of the best multiplayer nowadays. It is a great and addictive game that will surely entertain every kind of player thanks to its accessibility and well-developed mechanics."
17643,"its fun to play casual with friends and stuff, lots of amazing skins too. I wouldn't recommend ranked cause skill based matchmaking is a fucking joke, but casually its fun."
17644,SDF SDFS F SDF AWE
17645,"For a free game, I mean, it's a better Overwatch imo lol"
17646,"Very good game!

17647,great game with balance.... but like all other mmos expect a round were a hacker cant be killed...
17648,"At first I didn't care much about this game.
But it grew on me.
I played 19 hours a day to become the Pyre Lord.
I impulsively spent 59.99 € on the Deluxe Pack.
I don't care much about playing games. But this game somehow made me care."
17649,pretty fun
17650,"Fun game, cool looking characters, excellent waifus and great mechanics overall... few downsides are a wack match-making, bugs for days and battle pass system not friendly with casual players."
17651,wish overwatch

17653,BEST GAME EVER
17654,terrible game with terrible balancing issue and this review still accurate as july 2022 the game still unfun but to its merit hi rez as some of the best crossover event
17655,good
17656,Even tho nabong plays this game it's still bad
17657,"Fun game, not as sweaty as other shooters."
17658,"its good but after 10 or 20 hours for playing you will bored
"
17659,more enjoyable Overwatch
17660,If you want to play this one I highly recommend it as a squad game. Solo is worth it but squad is better.
17661,"Played this game on console, wasn't the biggest fan. Got my PC and needed some free games. Def a top pick, similar to Overwatch but has its own little twist. Has a ranked side to it as well for those comp. type gamers! Spent 16 hrs already on it and have had it for 3 days. Will also go as far to say that ive spent money with the company, see myself playing this game a lot! Hoped ive helped, much love and make sure to get full 8 hrs of sleepy lol."
17662,1 out of 5 games crashes like there is no tomorow and everytime i try to get back in that game it crashes 4 seconds later. game has to end to stop being a complete fucking potato
17663,"jogo e muito merda e desbalanceado, tanks dao dano e tankao. nunca vi uma coisa dessas. joguei varias vezes para dar uma chance para o jogo mas, nao deu outra."
17664,This is a very good game
17665,no
17666,"idk why o have 232 hours in this game
"
17667,Great Game
17668,"Ive been playing for a while now. Meta can get a bit stale at times, but overall a great free experience."
17669,"qwwqefs
"
17670,"developers actually pay attention to the game very fun team based hero shooter its basically free overwatch 
"
17671,"Fun and free. A very accessible game where each hero is unique but easy to pick up and try. lots of variation from character to character, match to match."
17672,very good! like overwatch but slightly worth.. worth more then free
17673,Moved to this game from Overwatch and I love it! I recommend.  The ability to create loadouts and purchase items allows characters to be played in any style you want which keeps the game entertaining.
17674,"basically free Overwatch with more characters and it has more variety with the talent, deck, and item systems to make any character better fit your play style."
17675,"Its a dead game and there are multiply reasons why. First of all getting champions the game has been out for a year so they have added a fair few champs, now they do have or at least they had a champion bundle which you could buy but from the people i have heard from it does take a while case being one of my friends waited 6 months and another a year.

Skill balance, as i have said its a dead game and so for the people that are playing consistently have gotten to a point where learning the game is either a chore or not even worth the effort, when you first play the game you will be matched up with other people new to the game as such you aren't dealing with anything too crazy but after about 2-4 hours in i started running into teams which were either a full team who have hundreds of hours into it or a single player that could completely hold a team back. As such it was hard to even get into the game at that point as most of the games at that point were awfully one sided to the point where leaving your base was a death sentence.

Legends, the actual playable character are something that i have mixed feelings on as some of the were very fun to play, though a lot of the characters did feel like they were inferior copies of characters from other games and that was not even the worst point.
Now there are a lo of games which have characters that are over-tuned or just over-powered but in Paladins there are multiply characters which are just game breaking to the point where you cannot really play against them or they can walk through your team as if it was a walk in the park, i'm not sure if there are plans to balance the game or if they have just given up on anything like that but looking at the game and its style i don't think there could be any major changes without changing the game itself.

All in all i would not recommend the game unless you are looking for a mindless time grind that will probably not evolve into anything satisfying, rewarding or something that most people will enjoy. 
I know i might get some comments saying oh you haven't played enough or maybe you were just bad but in the end these are my thoughts and opinions and people are welcome to voices their's and people are welcome to try the game for themselves."
17676,Good game innit
17677,"If your into team based games this is great for you, it has a high selection of champions and a variety of different maps."
17678,"not it

17689,"Great game<3
"
17690,"Great game! But match making takes more than 2 mins. 
Also, I get random notifications of gold that i didn't even receive in game but it keeps popping up after every game. Past notifications also keep popping up sometimes."
17691,"good
"
17692,like overwatch but you can do builds
17693,Everything is better than League of Legends

MARCH 2022 UPDATE: To actually make a serious review here: I am not going on 5 whole years of playing Paladins. At this point in time, can I recommend the game? 

To new players: No. Absolutely not. 
To older players: Yes* but there's a lot to learn coming back to the game even in the past year alone. 
Matchmaking often makes no sense. Casual games you get put against stacks, GM duos, etc. Ranked games don't fare much better with lower ranked players being boosted up to higher MMR lobbies. 

The game has potential to be fun, but it's unpolished and most of the devs have left and been replaced time and time again, so we're at a point where cosmetics are now the main focus of the game instead of actual content like maps, balance, gamemodes, etc. You get a new champion every 3 months or so, which is frankly a bit too much at this point. With over 50 champions, that's extremely overwhelming to most players, especially if you're a purely F2P player. With no good options to get all champions, past/present/future anymore you're left grinding or shelling out the cost of a brand new AAA game. There's a lot of customization which is great, but again it comes at the expense of being too much at this point. When Paladins had <40 champions it wasn't too bad, but adding more and more champions just increases the amount of *STUFF* in the game. Each champion has 3 talents with 6 loadout slots (3 being default) so you have enough to at least play, but making your own loadouts will take literal hours for someone who doesn't already play the game. 

Until the new player/free player experience is fixed, and the devs stop focusing on champions and cosmetics I absolutely cannot recommend Paladins in its current state."
17715,overwatch for poor ppl
17716,much better than overwatch
17717,pretty pog ig.
17718,"quite a terrible game
"
17719,its hella fun game ower all
17720,i lost
17721,"My friend introduced me to this game 2 years ago and I'm glad I didn't give up on it. Honestly, this game is pretty fun and I've met some cool people through it. It is pretty buggy, though... The VGS (Voice Guided System) can be annoying sometimes if you don't know the commands or have to use it in the middle of combat. I don't come across toxic players often, but like with every game, they do come up. Even with its flaws, this game is still pretty fun to play."
17722,booba
17723,this game is very fun
17724,b o o b a
17725,can play same as overwatch..but free version. Nice game BTW
17726,good game for being free the only way for me to describe it is a mix of overwatch and destiny rolled to gether fun game worth the download and try as its FREE
17727,Interesting characters. Very fun.
17728,"It's got an overwatch feel, lot's of fun to play with friends."
17729,Very fun :))
17730,Better and less boring overwatch.
17731,"brawlhalla = smash bros
paladins = overwatch"
17732,totally fun and Amazing :D
17733,why is skye so hot?
17734,penis
17735,"Really fun! Like, you can be all sort of things in this game. Like a healer Skye, a flanking Mal Damba, a damage Seris, or hell, you could just be unkillable with the right champ and talent!"
17736,"great game, love it!"
17737,"game wont open
also game sucks fuck uyou"
17738,"A very fun title overall, as long as you stay away from anything competitive. As someone who traditionally avoids ranked and other competitive game modes that suck out the fun from the game, Paladins is overall an enjoyable and well-produced experience.

The gameplay of Paladins isn't anything groundbreaking, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. While it can be a little rough around the edges, the core game loop of Paladins is fun and engaging. Among the three game modes available, you will most likely play Siege the most, which is for the better as the game was clearly designed with this game mode in mind. However, the occasional TDM and Onslaught matches are also a fun way to break the routine.
I appreciate the fact that matches are shorter in nature, which is perfect if you're looking to kill some time without having to commit for too long. It's uncommon for a match to go over the 15 minutes mark, unless there is a serious stalemate between the two sides.

I'm a person who appreciates good character design and artistic value, and Paladins does an excellent job in this area. HiRez have a proven track record of producing highly engaging characters and designs, and Paladins is no different. Their art division knows what they're doing and it shows. From the characters themselves to their various skins and customizations, there's something for everyone.
I will say, however, that a lot of the designs are overly sexualized, and can be quite over the top sometimes. This doesn't disturb me personally but I'm aware that some may find it distasteful. If you're looking for a more 'tame' style, Paladins may not be your cup of tea.

I'm writing this review as a strictly casual-only player. I avoid competitive games and modes like the plague; they take out a lot of the fun and turn what is supposed to be a fun and somewhat careless skrimish between strangers into a 'do-or-die' situation. I know that some people are looking solely for this side in games, but this has never been my thing and usually ended up degrading my experience rather than improve it. When your mindset is focused solely on winning, it becomes difficult to appreciate the areas where Paladins shines. If you are coming freshly new into this game, I implore you to avoid ranked so that you can enjoy it to its fullest.

Mind you, the game is not free of issues. Balancing a complex game with so many moving parts is never an easy job, but unfortunately HiRez are notorious for being weak in this area. Much like their other title SMITE, Paladins suffers from questionable balance choices and a strong sense of powercreeping. While not usually game-breaking, it can be quite frustrating to deal with some of this. I don't see myself as anything close to an expert in game balancing, but even as a mainly casual player I sometimes feel there's more to be desired.

Another issue is how limited are your customization options are if you choose not to spend real money on cosmetics and such. While there are some options that can be unlocked without paying, they are few and require an insane amount of grinding, and usually fall very short of their premium counterpart in terms of quality. The vast majority of cosmetics and customizations are locked behind paywalls and MTX, and especially frustrating is HiRez's infamous chests system, where you can only get certain items by opening chests (bought with real money) and hoping you roll the right thing out of what's in it. You can't just pick a skin you like and buy it, you are forced to play this dumb chest roulette and hope luck is on your side. Also, a lot of content is released as limited-time, so if you missed the time window to get it, it's gone forever. Joined the game late and found a skin that you really like? Too bad! You can't get it anymore, despite being teased with it over and over again.

Other key points:
 - Sound design is a bit of a hit-or-miss in Paladins. While fine in most places, there are some cases where critical audio cues (like character ultimates) cannot be heard properly or at all. Perhaps this is more of a technical issue, but the result is still the same.
 - Voice acting quality can greatly differ between different characters: most character voices are very well made and conviencing, but some sound ridiculously lazy or lackluster. I can safely say, however, that the majority of newer characters don't suffer from this.
 - In terms of technical performance, the game runs fine and dandy for me. I did not encounter any sort of crashes or serious bugs. Even lag isn't very common, which is a pleasant surprise considering the abysmal server status of HiRez's bigger title SMITE.
 - I have not met many toxic or unpleasant players in the game, but keep in mind I stick solely to casual. Maybe the case is different in ranked.

To summarize: Paladins is a fun game which I enjoy passing the time with as a casual-only player. The core gameplay is enjoyable and engaging, the characters are lively and well made, and the overall state of the game is good. There are, however, some noticable issues when it comes to balance, and the game is filled to the brim with cosmetic MTX and paywalls with some questionable practices. For the average player who doesn't mind either of these too much, however, Paladins is an overall solid choice that hits most of its marks.

And hey, it's free! Give it a try and see for yourself."
17739,da
17740,"fun to play with friends, or even just solo queue. very good free to play game that doesn't really need you to spend money, as you can unlock the champions for free. there is a wide selection of champions to choose from and they are all diverse and good in their own ways."
17741,"ga gay

"
17742,Victors stealing your kills but still great game
17743,would recommend to someone that likes fps and futuristic games
17744,"its dying and thats sad because its ACTUALLY a good game. its deep enough that you really do have a decent time sync and the gameplay is fun the only crappy thing, as is usually the case, is the playerbase.

 theyre either kids or theyre hardcore to a fault and think that because theyre whatever rank theyre amazing when the truth is the only barrier to entry to diamond is common sense and the patience to sit through ungodly queues for ranked made longer by one of those kids quitting before the game starts because someone banned a guy who wasnt who a youtuber told them should be banned. the great news tho is that there is a mute button which solves that problem.

 my review says 8 hours but i was a console player in beta so im not just giving initial impressions. 

 this game deserved better than it got from the gaming community and the devs"
17745,unbalanced
17746,"Overall, pretty fun. Basic shooter style, but with a fantasy twist. 

Pros: more than just a shooter (magical elements, etc), large player base so find matches quickly, simple mechanics
Cons: Toxic players/ snobby players (all games have them!), mismatched game art (it bugs me...)"
17747,"Few bugs here and there but pretty much an enjoyable game with an ample amount of players. Best played casual with friends. Game is plagued with bad players which easily cost games though. 

My tips are:
1. dont take the game seriously  (dont waste your life)

17752,This game is fun and not so stressful. :D
17753,"Hey all this is just a short review on paladins. Honestly speaking i use to play this non-stop since the founders pack was first released after since then as year 2021 comes into play this game has lost its respect and player base all in one since hi-rez lacks creativity , Balanced patches , and content. their battle pass each release is sub-par out of quality based on skins and content you get in each pass. their ""balanced "" patches are normally half assed by the dev team that don't entirely listens to their player base since why this game is slowly bleeding out like a slaughtered cow. would i recommend this game to anyone ? most likely not."
17754,"I do like Paladins a lot with friends. Playing by myself gets boring very quick and the amount of bugs you see are pretty bad. Overall a solid game, just wish Hi-Rez would step up their game and polish the game"
17755,fun with freidns better than overwatch becuase queue times are actually short and lots of champs to play definatly will play more
17756,its actually a really good game at first. but than the games gets worse the more you play. There are overpowered characters. Its becoming more like rainbow six siege because now you need to pick certain characters to counter others. just not as fun as it used to be.
17757,i like

17765,BAD TEAMATES
17766,"The game itself is alright but like most f2p games, it attracts noobs who probably fail at life as well...

To be more accurate, it is a very good alternative to Overwatch but you will need a thicker skin as the community's skill and rational thinking is abysmal while the game itself is more simplified."
17767,"i queue up to play my first ever ranked game and it takes 5:43 seconds to fins match, then a guy doesnt make a selection and the lobby breaks and now im in over a 10 min queue for my first ever game.  Why would anyone waste their time after that.  If this is the first experience people have when playing the game its no wonder they have no player base."
17768,"Really great game, although there are some more ""no skill required characters"" and sometimes they can get annoying. All in all it's an overall 9/10 game"
17769,h
17770,fun but RESPAWN IS KAK
17771,"Did you play League of Legends? It's the same shit. You will lose patience, health, and time just to be called retarted, skilless and whatever they come up with. Even worse, they encourage you to spend real money! And by encouragement I mean that you wont play rankeds, until you spend shit tone of time playing with the same champions over and over or buy pack of champs. If you are going to play alone, dont even consider downloading this game, playing with friends is the only thing that made me play this. Have a nice day"
17772,this is a good game to play with your friends
17773,It's a lot of fun to play with your friends however due the to bountiful amount of bugs and unbalances I wouldn't recommend playing it seriously
17774,awesome gAMEW

17808,fun
17809,free and good quality with great variety of champions. so many to choose from!
17810,gud
17811,"its a pretty cool and fun game, tons of interisting and fun to play characters. They also update often and add new characters so the game feels fresh and never gets old."
17812,overwatch v 2 lol but still a good game
17813,"Literally this game got improved so much. At the beginning it was only a cash grab (it is still but not so much anymore), now there are actually things you can play for. We all know Paladins Battlegrounds was a failure but they learnt from it. There is a pro that is a con at the same time. It is good to have many Champions so you get a wide variety of playstyles but they become too much. Just too many champions to overlook them all and their abilities, it is literally confusing. The game mechanics are pretty good, there is a variety of modes and regular events, pretty fun. Now i don´t know what to write anymore. hope this helped anyways. I recommend it!"

17821,Revised review: Still bad
17822,Noice
17823,"Bueno, sobre este juego, tengo varias cosas que decir. Vamos a empezar por lo bueno.
Cosas piolas 
-Optimización, siempre te va a ir a 60 fps estables, con su configuracion adecuada
-Graficos
-Mecanicas, no son nada originales ni creativas, pero son divertidas de usar las habilidades, y como cada personaje es unico, es más divertido aún.
Cosas malas:
-El Matchmaking es una verdadera basura, y no me refiero a campeones de nivel 120, porque el nivel da bastante igual, me refiero al nivel de los jugadores.

-El balanceo de los campeones es una verdadera bosta, hay campeones que ya nadie usa porque son caros, dificiles de usar, y apenas les podes sacar utilidad, en cambio hay otros que aunque valen 60000, hacen harto daño y están rotísimos, tal como es el caso de Raum y de Talus, que no es imposible ganar partidas con ellos con enemigos, pero si es bastante complicado, más todavía porque son campeones bien faciles de usar.

-Ultimamente los desarrolladores no le dan bola a los aspectos malos del juego, solo a lo que les da algo de plata para el bolsillo, como lo son las skins, campeones, pases de batalla, eventos, etc, mientras hay un montón de bugs (recién hace poco quitaron un bug de Evie que estuvo desde hace casi un año, que era lo más game-breaking que ví) no hay un mapa nuevo desde hace 2 AÑOS, quitaron funciones que estaban buenas, como la mejor partida, la tercera persona, los puntos de misiones, etc. 
En fin, los desarrolladores de verdad hicieron que yo odie este juego en ciertos aspectos, nunca me enojo en videojuegos, como cs:go o Rainbow six, pero con este, me quema un montón, porque este tipo de cosas están desde hace pila de tiempo, y no parece que se vayan a reparar nunca.
Lamento, pero no lo recomiendo."
17824,noice
17825,i couldnt care less tbh
17826,Çok kötü bir oyun adamlar ölmüyor grafikler çöp gibi sanki çizgi film karakterleriyle oynuyoruz viktor çok kötü bir karakter Sky çok güçlü 14 saat oynamışım yalandan kart düşsün diye ben hayatımda bu kadar kötü bir oyun görmedim arkadaşlarımı benden çaldı zalım oyun kimseye tavsiye etmiyorum ben düştüm iyi kötü kurtuldum
17827,pretty good like  overwatch but too much heroes and there is too much info u need to know at the start like seige but pretty addicting game
17828,just download this game play about 1 game then delete the game again is so bad that i really hate this game nothing but laggy server crash when i play this game.
17829,VF
17830,"this is my favorite game

17831,it ok arcade game especially for free :)
17832,Yes
17833,i love this game i play on all platforms
17834,WW2
17835,"i like the artistic direction but the lack of levels and the confusing character skill sets put me off the game. i played as pip for example and the weapon was powerful but my character was week, which makes sense for balance, but then i join a game and i get destroyed by pip who was a bullet sponge with a powerful weapon. was i missing something. i also found it frustrating that i couldn't run. i was hoping this would be a good game as me and a friend want to play cross-platform but i guess the hunt for a good game continues."
17836,fun game try it once even if u r noob :P
17837,.
17838,its amazing
17839,nice game
17840,Is good
17841,"Working on top of the strong and fairly balanced foundation of a free-to-play hero shooter, Paladins’ capacity for experimentation is its greatest strength. Even after over 300 hours of exhilarating battles and strategic planning, champions continue to find a way to offer new gameplay experiences. Whether it’s the main mode that encapsulates the teamwork aspect or the character designs that immediately flow with creativity, Paladins: Champions of the Realm clearly stands out in the midst of competition."
17842,"Great game, prolly one of the best i've played in a while :)
i'd give it 10/10 for the dynamic gameplay,really stunning
10/10 for the graphics
10/10 for the lore
10/10 for the characters and the mechanics
overall,for me its a super fun game :)

17853,rfy
17854,vary good game it does need some help on the skilled based match making
17855,Epic and its free
17856,good game
17857,i played more on my ps4 but like issa good game kinda do be a lil pay to win tho i like the game
17858,This game is so hot
17859,This one of my favorite games
17860,i love this game so so much
17861,yes
17862,"Too many tits, not enough fun."
17863,Best game since combat arms
17864,this is actually not a overwatch copy OK
17865,"Let me start off by saying I really do love this game. It has a lot of fun character designs and feels super free flow gameplay. Being able to experiment with many different builds is a super fun mechanic and leaves room for a lot of creativity. Anyone that said this game is an Overwatch ripoff clearly never actually played this game and could see how much better it is in terms of gameplay.

That's where the positives end.

There are so many things wrong with actually playing the game. Paladins is a buggy mess, especially on consoles. Constant crashing, random frozen screens, sounds not loading, the terrible bounty shop that was recently closed from how buggy that was, there's just so much of it that ruins this game for me. On consoles it's even worse. When a match just starts it'll force close or take forever to load. It's just poorly optimized and Hi-Rez doesn't want to admit it.

Then there's the matchmaking. It's so unbearable. Sometimes you queue up with people who have thousands of hours in this game and have previously reached grandmaster, or you get someone who just started playing and refuses to take any form of advice. One match you'll be able to wipe the other team in minutes, other times it happens to you. There is rarely any even matches from the major skill gap in everyone on both teams. It gets even worse when you play ranked and you can't queue with more than a single friend with similar skill which completely diminishes coordination in a team based game. Making it so you need 2 groups of 2 people and 1 person alone to do qualifications for ranked takes away some of the team aspects of a ranked mode. Other games that do this are also just as bad for this. I will never understand limiting queue with friends. Even for the higher ranks (Diamond and above) can only queue with one other person. This doesn't affect casuals which is fine, but it shouldn't affect ranked. That is the majority of the time that you need to queue with friends or a competitive group. It's so hard to avoid bad matchmaking in this game and Hi-Rez refuses to do anything about it. 

All of these problems could easily be solved if the devs decided to just put money into fixing the game instead of adding new skins every day. Start putting the budget into making the game playable and this would be a much more positive review. I doubt they'll take any input into consideration much like a lot of game devs do. 

Only play this game if you really need something to do with your friends, otherwise play a different shooter. 



Overall Paladins in its current state gets a 5/10, needs a lot of improvement.



Also stop making skins limited, it's a shitty business tactic that literally gives you less money."
17866,Barik
17867,ok kinda unbalanced
17868,"the game keeps crashing and is always unable to launch. Out of seven launches, the game will only proceed to the menu once."
17869,it is very fun
17870,This game is a very good free alternative to something like overwatch if you want it to be that but if you forget all about games like that stand alone this is a very fun game with interesting characters to play which are easy to pick up for new players and can be mastered to a point we're as long as your good with a character you can dominate a match
17871,"Fun game, Can be annoying sometimes due to braindead teammates, Addicting"
17872,awesome!!
17873,yes
17874,i liked this game and i recomenden
17875,"Never seen such a terrible Optimized game awful programming. Feels like a Windows XP game would be better if it comes to the optimization / programming
~edit   About the gameplay my personal preference would be Overwatch for me Overwatch feels just better if you not into this Game, but if you like the Core Idea behind it, you should try Overwatch out. Also, I'm not a fan of the UI it feels ancient and just not up to date."
17876,"good game to play with friends
"
17877,good game if played with a full party or competent randoms
17878,great overwatch free edition
17879,Meh
17880,"fude
"
17881,good game overall.
17882,Highly addictive. Handle with care.
17883,"I have no idea why but on only Hi-Rez games I have insane ping. I've played SMITE and Paladins for a very long time, and have been constantly getting 1000+ ping spikes almost every game for the past year or so. (I'm not kidding, I've used the in game ping tracking tool). I don't know if this is happening because of my area, but it makes the games unplayable. The game is honestly fun, but if your location dictates wherther or not you can play the game, then I guess I drew a bad hand."
17884,"it sucks dont be healer

edit: its awsome, be healer"
17885,choke me like you hate me but you love me
17886,not great
17887,if the other team has cauterise and you're the healer you just really can't contribute to the game
17888,I am not going to recommend this game since majority of my matches have had people who are AFKing in spawn. I can not find anyway in game to avoid these people are to report them.  4 out of my 6 match had AFKERS.
17889,stoner game
17890,"very good is fun

As much as I love the characters and what this game has to offer, I can't recommend it to friends who expect a full game. And this is just the PC version. Switch version is a MESS.

17950,This game is a blast. Fun as hell.
17951,"5.5 hours and already spent $45 on cosmetics and heros, pretty fun"
17952,"This games awesome to play with friends, specially if you are 5 and play together. You have lots of diversity in champion select which helps you find what fits your play-stile best. 
The game receives monthly updates which makes hardcore players adapt to new circumstances and maintains it fresh.
From what I read, previously the game had a better professional environment, but now its slacking compared to other games on the environment.
Some what of a problem are the amount of bugs you encounter in normal play, hopefully they will keep on working on them.
Recommend it, but be aware of what you are getting into, its not a game with a money investment on their backs such as League of Legends or others
Sorry for English, its not my main language"

18022,"This game have no balance, Stealth Champions are all broken cause and how strong each Champion is 100% depend on how edgy they look or how new they are, almost all the Original Champions as effective as being meat shield.

For example:
1) The Stealth Champion that look like a ""Ninja"" with Smg can tanks 2 mini-gun from a Guardian Champion with no problem, no backlash, no shock, he just eat every bullets.
2) The Stealth Champion with 2 knives can fly, infinitely, and this wasn't a deliberate design choice, she wasn't this broken 2 years ago, now she is flying and her hit box is the smallest.
3) Thunder Orc, one of the OG healer damage haven't increase since launch while every other Champion had been burf or nerf, now using him in PvP is pretty much useless.
4) That Guardian Champion that look like a giant rolling bug is too big, his size doesn't fit with the map, so it's either fighting him in a small choke point or everyone shooting at him in a small choke point, just don't work well in game, for both team.

in Conclusion:
This game were good 2 years ago, average to bad in 2021 cause how experience player can freely abuse the broken champion mechanics. New Champion are usually poorly create, backstory is crap, over power when launch and may remain so if he/she/it is edgy. Every healer class is weak, low health, low damage (except 1 floating guy) and low healing. 

You may blame me for being dumb or bad at this game, but i'm experience enough, was doing decent 2 years ago, stop playing cause School, reinstall the game and this is the stage that they are in?

Is this a future of Paladin? this is worst than those China's TF2 and Overwatch copy, heck lag is still a problem. Develop team, please fix the game.

18028,"A really great game and better than Overwatch in many regards. For one, there is no roll queue, which means if you don't want to tank/heal you don't have to wait more than 10 minutes to find a match. And because tanks and healers are actually fun to play, you tend to end up with balanced champion selections regardless. It's just a blast to play, especially with friends; matches are short and fun, without becoming heated and stressful. There's a good variety of maps as well, both in terms of the numbers and in terms of their stylistic and layout variety. It's got a very nice cartoon-ish art style, and is extremely well optimised even for low-end systems. There's a huge variety of champions to choose from, and its free-to-play mechanics are fair and reasonably priced - you get a free pool of champions to choose from, and can easily earn in-game currency to unlock more without paying real money. And you can try them before you buy them by using the shooting range mode. I don't like comparing it to Overwatch given that Paladins invented the genre first, but basically if you like that game and want something a little different (or if you have problems with how Overwatch plays these days), I highly recommend this game. It leans more heavily into MOBA mechanics than Overwatch - especially because you can use premade or custom loadouts per champion which totally change how each champion plays, and there's an in-game shop/item mechanic much like you'd find in League or Dota 2, though it's usually set to automatically purchase."

With visual and other bugs up its poopoo hole, some comes from OB times, they patch 2 up and 9 comes in their place. Matchmaking makes no sense, and competitive is fool of poopoo holes.

Paladins is a great game at its base. It also has the best skins of any fps game IMO. Why? simply because the skin voiceovers are so cool. However, the game's servers can suck at times which can be really frustrating."
18053,It's nice

18055,This is a really great game when it comes to skill combat missions. Although there are some bugs where this game lacks a bit but Hirez is working out their best at their every update to improve this game. The overall frame work of this game is really great. Textures and shadow detailing is flawless if you are running this on high graphics and your GPU supports it. This is a free game and 5 vs 5 first player shooter game with different game modes from Ranked to Casual. Really nice animations of ultimates and sounds where you can feel your own character as you :D YOU MUST GIVE IT A TRY!!

18059,"Paladins gives you multiple talents and deck loadout which makes your style different from time to time, which is super refreshing. It's less of a clusterfluck compared to it's competitor during gunfight and can be a bit of a braindead at times, the champions are a bit simple and easier to understand but I can appreciate that more than having to read a novel for an ability or 200 years of experience to understand the champion's basic."

18071,As someone who has played both Overwatch and Paladins for more than 400 hours I can tell you that Overwatch is definetely better. That being said this game is free unlike Overwatch so if you do not have the money play this. Even if Overwatch is the better game Paladins is no slouch so you should give it a try. Paladins is a great game if you ignore the bugs and bad matchmaking and overall lack of polish.
18072,"Soo  buggy game is fun but it is the easiest game to run, but they have made it the worst game to run because of how trash the coding is"
18073,"One of the first games I got on my Switch, and the first I got on Steam. Over 600 hours total (Switch and Steam) in this game, and I only regret 100 of them. It's a super fun game, and not just a ""poor man's Overwatch"". Definitely worth it to play at least a few matches."
18074,Very fun game to play with friends. Lots of things to do in it never feel bored. 8/10 would reccomend

18077,Can be challenging for new players. What you find your characters though it can be so much fun. The ability to totally alter a character in one direction is hilarious. I love being a drogoz.

18088,"Very unique artstyle and champions. Brings something new to the table with different talents, loadouts, etc. Updates every so often as well. I've had over 1K hours on console, so I'll try to reach that sometime soon lol. I absolutely love this game. I got my friends to play it who were Overwatch fans and they preferred this over it. Same as me. This game /may/ be slightly similiar to the latter, but I can assure that this game is one-of-a-kind.

Fantastic game, amazing developers, beautiful artstyle. I'd give this game a 9/10, only because I don't really enjoy having to remake a custom lobby each time one ends lol. Overall a great game. <3

18106,"Awesome game that is hero/champion based, like Overwatch. It mixes FPS and fantasy. I used to only play hack'n'slash MMORPGs, as a healer. I love the amount of different playstyles and characters you can choose from. The game is heavily influenced by SMITE, the publisher's previous game. All in all, it was instant love for me, I love this game so much! Super fun, especially with friends. Of course some people are toxic and salty, but you rather see that in competitive matches, casual is normally pretty chill. Great way to physically relax, while working out with my brain, after work! Only could recommend it!
My only issue is how you can't get old battle pass/event pass skins anymore. I'm in love with the Radiant Stars Battle Pass items,especially the skins, and I wish I could buy them, but there's no option for it. I didn't even know of this game when that was live. Some say, that it takes 7-8 months for them to put these items into loot boxes. Loot boxes aren't bad in this game. You actually save crystals! There's no crap items, it's usually all skins, sometimes a special mount too. 
In conclusion: come chill. It's a great game! :)"

18161,"I have to admit, at one point I really enjoyed this game. It was my first fps shooter (unfortunately) and I found that the game had an overly passionate community, and so was I. I've played since beta and dunked nearly 3k hours into it. Paladins has an ok meta but is ultimately held back by Hi rez. Patch notes don't mean shit, and it feels like the developers don't actually know whats problematic with some characters as they constantly buff perfectly balanced characters in one department and then the following patch nerf their entire kit making them ultimately not viable for competitive play, regardless of how fun they are. Or they would completely revert the nerf / buff entirely making no progress in actually developing a more fun meta. I could swear that they're doing this on purpose to give the illusion that they're working on the game when the same 10 characters get changed every other patch. Because of this aside from new characters this game doesn't get a lot of actual content, its generally only skins to look forward too, the new maps are dogshit and characters have a reputation of being super broken, and even if they were not they're reasonably locked out of competitive play until the next patch which is on a monthly cycle now. Regarding balancing - actual fun play-styles get taken away or brutally nerfed and are never replaced with anything as unique or creative. I wouldn't say this game has the same problem as Overwatch where 1 team comp is a must pick, even though the community likes to think of it like that sometimes, but what seemed like a player expressive game quickly turned into same-y play-styles across different characters because too many loadouts are the same. The main gimmick of this game is it's card system that allows for champions to change their play-styles to fit their needs and specifically counter some team comps. This was true very early on and it shows when you look at older characters but generally 70% of the cards in this game are pure number buffs which I recognize CAN influence your play-style in subtle ways but are so un-optimal and underutilized. It feels very lazy seeing a card that increases your mag size by 4 when there are no doubt infinitely more ways to make things interesting. I have to blame this laziness on the implementation of Talents, which used to be Legendary cards in loadouts. Before Talents didn't exist so there were a lot more extreme cards that you would put into your loadouts, and although they still exist in the form of a talent they ultimately bottleneck future characters by not giving them zany cards that used to be a staple in the game's beta. I complained earlier about the devs never actually making any progress with anything as they make changes they quickly take them back in the following patch, this wouldn't be such an issue since it kinda makes the game fresh in a way where characters could slowly rotate out the meta and the slept on ones would slowly crawl forward as people experimented. I find this an issue though because there are actual problems with the game that need to be addressed first. I wouldn't say the game needs to be as polished as Overwatch but it doesnt fulfill the basic needs of a functioning game. There are way too many game breaking bugs and inconsistency issues, and while a portion of them has been fixed, its been a slow climb. Features of the game have been taken out to fix bugs in promise of it returning in a cleaner more polished setting but those have never been fulfilled and is even realized to never really fix main bugs. It's hard to even blame the current devs on this one because the game was built with so much spaghetti code and because the staff has been double Thanos snapped out of the company because of a huge money issue it had in its late beta. Hi rez left the mostly new  and small development team with a dying game filled with impossible to understand code and 3 Mount Everests worth of bugs. You will definitely see bugs being fixed but they're so minute and unnoticeable that it becomes a waste of resources. Its unfortunate because the dev team is so small for this game and they've even admitted to not being able to recover from the shitty engine its running on. As a veteran player I wished this game would get a remake or a sequel because Hi rez's modern games have way more polish than paladins but I know it will never happen. This game theoretically had the capability of being a 10/10 but I don't see a future for it anymore especially since its esports was cut off by the company. 

Oh and the matchmaking literally makes no sense you could actually be gold and on a level 20 account and get matched with the #1 world champion as no joke it happened to me. Despite this hi rez reduces your party to 2 once you reach diamond and makes it so that low elo players cant queue with hi elo friends, even though you could queue snipe each-other with like 50% accuracy regardless of your rank. The devs even admitted to having a system that auto fills the queue after like 7 minutes, which it gets up to consistently in high elo, - scratch that - plat players get queues of like 7+ mins daily.

Coming from a consistent Diamond player who never really tried getting farther from that.

It sucks leaving this game as I haven't really found a good alternative, playing any other hero shooter make them feel really slow and aimless in terms of objectives. I felt like games in Overwatch didn't engage me constantly and when it did, it didn't compare to peak compared to paladins. Also TF2 didn't really cut it for me, I dunno why."

18166,"I used to love this game back when it was in beta, but now I can't recommend it to anyone looking for more than a few nights of fooling around with friends. Hi-Rez continues their trend of ruining games by introducing terrible updates. Horribly balanced gameplay that just seems to get worse with every new character is the tip of the iceberg. There's tons of bugs, poor matchmaking, and countless other problems. I'd love nothing more than to see this game get fixed in the future but I can't see that happening as it has been following this trend for a while."
18167,"Paladins: Champions of the realm in 2021 is one of the finest free to play experience modern gaming can offer. This game has a ridiculously rough history but the devs have fought through it to deliver an experience. The game is satisfying. Hooking someone as Makoa is a surge of chemical happy hormones. Tough situation forcing you into clutch situations and coming out of it alive is an amazing feeling. The thrill of finding that one teammate, who may live miles apart, perfectly in sync with you using the indepth VGS system is amazing. 
Paladins is underrated. Crimanally so. Right now in 2021, Paladins keeps on improving every patch. Right now is the perfect time to jump in."

18195,Crash on start up
18196,Ever since Raum and Lex were added the game stopped being fun. Fuck Raum and Lex
18197,i have been playing this game for 3 yrs now and it is still one of my favor games.
18198,"im playing this game only because of my addiction but this is the worst game ever. for those who is thinking to dowload this game just go play something else that does not make you cancer.
Assume you play a ranked game:
Someone will be certainly troll or atleast one of your team members will just quit and leave you 5v4 even if they don t quit on purpose, someone is gonna get dc'd. If they don t disconnected this means you are the one who is gonna disconnect and before you comeback game is gonna be finished and you will be lost.
If people does not like a matchmaking; after a 10 mins lobby waiting someone is gonna dash the game and you ll be have to wait another 10-15 mins to start to play another game.
There are quite a lot of hackers by the way and reporting system DOES NOTHING. If you have an afk and even if you report them you still lose exp and afk player gets no punishment at all.
Teams are always arguing instead of playing most of the time. So if you lose the first point you are gonna lose the game cuz of the spammers but i might say it is unlikely to involve a discussion.
Matchmakings are horrable, no balance ever. the first guy in your team might be on the first 10 of the game and last guy might have been just started yesterday or might be playing his first ranked ever.
Character roles are so stupid:
there are dmg heroes who have shield
there are flank heroes who have tons of hp or self heal or damage reduction, even there is a hero that heals almost as much as a healer
there are tanks that healing or dealing more dmg than an avarage dps class hero
healers can stun you like 2 sec with tons of dmg (extermination furia).
Im writing these down cuz if i wanna play this game again so i can read these and don t do the same mistakes. This game is just a waste of time (believe me i've played this game almost 2500hrs)
There are a lot of more things to say but i think above reasons are enough to quit or not to start playing this game for someone who does not wanna get old 10 times faster."
18199,gud innit
18200,"It's a fun game...as long as you don't mind toxic players, trolls, cry babies and the occasional hacker."
18201,bad
18202,"yes
"
18203,"I played this game a few years back on PS4 and it was fun. I have Viasat living in the sticks now and found out that I could play this game with no problems. Only character so far I cannot play is Maeve because of latency with her one speed move kinda bites as she once was my favorite but I found IO now. So I now play the PC version and it is still very fun though I am sad they removed the camera view as I liked looking at my skins sometimes. All in all the game is great no pay to win and all is pretty fair. The free to play foundation is also very good and not greedy like some, but I do suggest the battle pass. I would recommend this game to anyone wanting a very decent multiplayer experience."
18204,everything
18205,"Yes this looks like overwatch but minor tweaks make it more fun :
- Characters are less restricted to their roles. Squishy DPS still have a decent amount of HP and healers can still hold their own in accidental 1v1s encounters.
- You can tweak your character's build and playstyle somewhat using a flat point buy system
- Awesomenauts-like midmatch shop to get stat boosts
- Playerbase isn't full of toxic crybabies as far as I can tell

It's free to play so might as well try it."
18206,i got this game cause im boycotting overwatch
18207,If they delete Io this game will be a 10/10
18208,"Very good game its like free overwatch

18209,hey fellow players out there i would recommend you to play this game its are really fun game and you can get cool horses and other amazing things all you have to do it just press the get button please get  it!!!
18210,awsome playstyle
18211,"I think at one time I overestimated it. Reading the news on the game, I imagined that the game would be as driving as TF2 was. Having tried it, I was a little disappointed. I remember how I even laughed it off that pensioners went into battle. I even decided to go back to TF2 for a while to consolidate my memories, and thus strengthened my confidence in it. Even Heavy, who was not very hasty, was more cheerful than half of the heroes. Perhaps it seems to me so or the game was really made for this kind of gameplay, but..."
18212,great
18213,the game is fun overall i wish you could buy level's again the game needs a bug patch
18214,"The second overwatch, but nice."
18215,epic gamer moment

18225,"Yeeeeees
"
18226,"fun to play
"
18227,bleeeeeeeaah
18228,"Main reasons why you should stop playing:
1. Game has no future. (Very repetitive content)
2. Developer is well known to abandoned games. (Global Agenda, Tribes, Hand of the Gods, Paladins Strike, Realm Royale)
3. Developer just catches on the trend. (Smite-Dota/Lol, Paladins-Overwatch, Realm Royale- Fortnite, Rogue Company-Valorant/Apex)
4. Terrible customer service and SEA servers (Deserter lockdown) 
5. The new voice lines are bland and super cringe
6. Terrible decisions and Unnecessary balance changes (TOP PLAY? GONE. TURNED TO ASHES.)
7. Game is 90% full of bugs and OB 64 is history. (CARDS UNBOUND, level 10 cards.)
8. The whole Community only just begs for another Lian/Maeve skin
9. The new champions are just furry bait and new abilities are a very obvious copypaste.
10. 50% of the negative reviews here on Steam just says ""Overwatch clone"" lmao

TLDR: Game has a lot of potential but stoopid developers"
18229,ok
18230,u must get this game this game is pro fight and the best part it is pro freee
18231,"tons of fun, easy to unlock new characters, multiple different play styles. great game overall"
18232,"Amazing game. Although it sucks when you queue up with people below 100 IQ but still it's fun and competitive.

18242,"fun, but the community last I played was small. This game needs more attention, as a more magical Valorant, before Valorant. I like their twist on the TF2 payload, and the game handles comfortably."
18243,IM CUMMING
18244,Very nice game!
18245,Fun game but broken meta. Kinda annoying how the devs keep adding too much microtransaction to the game.

Brawl it out in 5v5 matches as one of a colorful cast of characters, each imbued with their own abilities. Players can further customize their characters by enhancing some abilities over others through an extensive card system. Work together to secure the objective and then escort a cart to the opposing team's base to win the round. The first team to secure 4 points wins the game. Further customize your hero by purchasing items with currency earned during a match. Rank up your heroes and enter competitive play to test your skills and ability to work with other players to make split decisions that will either win or lose you the game."

They also add new heroes more frequently than Overwatch which is nice, but game has a lot more bugs and little issues that Hi-Rez never seems to really care about.

 Once upon a time I got the full pack of all current heroes and upcoming heroes for $10 usd on sale, which I 100% recommend, but not sure if that's still a thing."

18340,fun free game definatly rec
18341,very fun very cool
18342,"as a seasoned Paladins player i can't help but disagree with almost everything said in this video. I felt like you guys didn't take this game seriously even though it is very in depth and very competitive as well as all the champions are really balanced. Also there is not really a cheating problem, cheaters are very rare in Paladins. There is an item called Illuminate in the game which directly counters your invisibility so that's why the Androxus was able to see you while you were invisible, no cheats needed for that...

There is a huge amount of variation in how you can play each different champion, which is awesome. You have healers that can be played as damage dealers with the right loadout cards. In Overwatch you pick a character and are stuck playing that playstyle, in Paladins you can customize the living hell out of your champion's build and there is way more variation in playstyles. And btw, the game is not ""Chill"" at all, it is super competitive, way more competitive than Overwatch. Overwatch is way more casual than Paladins. If you think you can play Paladins in a ""Chill"", ""Casual"", ""Braindead"" way (just quoting you guys), you will be in for some nice flaming in Ranked, your teammates will probably all report you for feeding.

The main differences between Overwatch and Paladins is the artstyle, and in Paladins you have more freedom when picking champions for your team versus the more balanced queing system that Overwatch has where you are forced to play 2 tank 2 heal 2 damage. Also Paladins has a bit more competitive player base than the Overwatch player base which is more casual.

Now that I actually finished watching the entire video I have to say this is a super uninformed garbage video, you guys seriously have no idea what you're talking about sorry. This game is just too complex for you guys to form an opinion on in 15-20 hours of gameplay. You call this game easy? Then why did I just watch 34 minutes of garbage gameplay, how can you call a game easy when you do not even know how to play it properly? I wouldn't be so harsh on you guys if you would have made a decently informed video but this garbage is just inexcusable."

18346,"I really like Paladins. I'm not a traditional MOBA, but I do like first person shooters. I'm also a sucker for free to play games. This scratches an itch I feel every once in a while when I'm not feeling overwatch."
18347,"It's MOBA Overwatch but free so why tf not. The game provides multiple champions that can range from launching nukes to turning you into a f**king biscuit and get eaten by a two-headed lizard. Not to mention you got skins and battlepasses that are pretty f**kin cheap in my opinion.

The card builds and talents might overwhelm you at first but with a little research and understanding (hopefully you aren't a brainlit) you can get through that s**t."
18348,Great game to play with friends!
18349,enjoyable
18350,"This game is great if you're looking for one of the best free to play fps games. The gameplay is great, characters are diverse, and it's extremely beginner friendly. At the price of $0.00, it's one of the best shooter games i've found. I even stopped playing overwatch because of how much i like this. This game's characters playstyle is very customisable, and its also has many different things that I honestly think Paladins does better than overwatch."

"
18358,"This is a very cool and well thought out game. I originally strayed away because of the claims it is an Overwatch clone. I disagree with dismissing it like that. It has more depth to it than Overwatch due to the ability to customize your character via the card decks and the fact you buy ""items"" to modify your character during the game. There are no healing packs strewn about the map, either. I dont miss them and neither will you. The Champions are interesting and well thought out, as well.  As for the maps, they are well designed, have a dynamic flow to them and allow for different approaches to how they are played.

If you like team base, objective driven FPS games, you should definitely give this a try. I definitely dont regret going against the popular (and incorrect) characterization of it being Overwatch if you bought it on Wish. Im certainly you wont either."

Also if your texture quality is below ""very high"" textures don't load up properly and it's pretty awful to look at. Other than that,  cool game :)"

I've played this game on and off since the beta and while it's had it's rough patches in the past, I still love it.

Also the characters remind me of bargain bin Pixar rejects, which is pretty funny. :)"
18396,"i started on console wasent the best, now that im on pc im winning almost every match, this game is great xD"
18397,"A great game to play when you have a five man of frenids to game with, support/tank main so i get wanked off by the boys, W in every way possible lets go! 100 emoji."
18398,This game is fun and all but you should spend your time playing Team fortress 2 instead of this game.
18399,"Free Overwatch. Pretty alright, but I would recommend Overwatch over this"
18400,:)
18401,"Game can be buggy at times, but the mechanics of building decks is unique and can completely change how you play a champion. Playing with friends is definitely more enjoyable as you can just laugh off the bugs that loves to pop up every now and then :)"
18402,literally just better overwatch
18403,GOOD
18404,this is amazing
18405,Horrible players..
18406,noice
18407,It's good
18408,"It is a fun game, but some characters could look better in my opinion. I like the fact that it is less complex than some other games and you can just start to play it right away!"
18409,free Overwatch
18410,"this game could lose u some frends and your mental health ,but u should try it becouse this game makes me want  kms every time i play it ,i hope this was usefull"
18411,One of the most chill and fun games I played.
18412,I brought this cuz i'm too poor to buy overwatch lol
18413,"The system of Loadouts is unique which makes it different from other games according to me. Besides, its not a game where you find guns everywhere but varieties of stuffs depending on champions which is again my choice."
18414,gun
18415,MANT YOU WANT SEGGS?

18419,I'm yer Dah
18420,bad ripoff of overwatch
18421,"Better than overwatch, at least"
18422,Matchmaking is complete dogshit. Game would not allow you to queue ranked before level 15 to match you with players within your skill level so you'll be playing normal games for a while. I'm an actual newbie and this game will match you with 2-3 year players along with 3 other newbies and maybe 1 veteran player. I'm uninstalling this garbage.
18423,epic game if u dont have overwatch
18424,"wiped all of my saved data, not worth it"
18425,nigga this game is good
18426,Pretty fun so far
18427,The female characters have very good personalities ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
18428,"I used to play this game so much. I still play it today but pretty rarely, in my opinion it is a super good game!! I would really recommend you get it :)"
18429,"A fun, free alternative to Overwatch, and a great way to scratch the squad-based-FPS itch in a unique manner."
18430,"This game is much simpler in mechanics than other shooters but that works to its advantage. The matches are fast but do need some planning if you want to succeed. But for as long as I've played this game, I've never grown tired of it and will hop in from time to time."
18431,the game make me smile
18432,"Great, fast paced game with awesome graphics and concepts, love it"
18433,da
18434,"This game has too much of the so called ""social justice"" implemented in every nook and cranny. Developers would do better to fix the issues with their games. Instead they care about someone who supposedly doesn't feel represented because they cant display their sexuality on their profile."
18435,its...
18436,"I met my wife on this game. She was the most beautiful woman I’ve ever met.
After dating on and off for 4 years, we decided to get married.

We eventually decided to adopt a child because she couldn’t get pregnant,
his name was Jamie. But then things changed for the worst, she started getting sick.

I started to panic, I became angry and confused, but she told me everything is going to be fine, that’s just how she was. She started getting worse and worse everyday, but she kept a brave and positive attitude, I don’t know how she did it.

After she died I was lost for a long time, my son also stopped paying attention at school.
The teachers understood, at first. But after a while they got more and more angry, they called me many times, but I was wrapped up in my own sadness to do anything about it.

As soon as he turned 18 he decided to drop out of school, I understood why he did it, although I encouraged him to stay. At this point I had quite a bit of money saved, so I decided to travel the world with him for a year, It was what we needed both.
He now lives in London with his boyfriend, and I couldn't be more proud.

I haven’t booted up this game in a long time, but after sitting in my apartment without really doing anything since I retired I decided to play it one more time.
And then the tears came rolling, they just couldn't stop coming. My father always told me that crying is for the weak, so I never really let it all out. But I am so glad I did.

She was an Angel. I never fell in love with anyone after her death, because I didn’t need to.

Thank you for creating this game Chris Shanas, it defined my life and who I am as a person."

18505,"[h1] Should you try playing paladins? [/h1]
Personaly I would recomend this game if you want something diffrent from all the others.Many say It's a free version of Overwatch and I my opinion that not very true.I have overwatch too but for some reason I liked Paladins better.
[u] A list of things I like about this game [/u]
[list]
    [*]You don't have to wait for a game,It only takes a couple of seconds to find a match
    [*]All the champios are equaly balanced.
    [*]The game doesn't require a buffy computer and Isn't very resurce taking
    [*]It has very good graphics and It's optimisation is amazing
    [*]It's very fun to play with friends,trust me.
[/list]
From what I have experieced plaing this game for years, It isn't what it used to be.There aren't as much players as before , but i don't think the game is dieing.It get updates every now and then and balance updates and bug fixes very often.
So to answere the question.yes this game is worth playing especially with friends.

Its my frist review ever and I'm not native in english so sorry for the misspells.I hope you'll enjoy your time playing.
Good Luck my friends."

18513,Lots of Fun
18514,"I started playing Paladins somewhere around update 9 or so. This game has evolved and grown and changed so much since I started playing it that I can hardly believe how much fun it is.

It often gets compared to the competition, but honestly I find I spend more time with this game than the other one.

The pace is more hectic and frantic, playing support roles or tank roles don't feel like a drag because their skill sets and the card/buy systems allow you to pitch your roles into a direction that better suits your play styles.

The art, character design, their kits & skills, and misc other balance changes have come light years since I first played.

If you're still on the fence on this one or you avoid it because you ""heard it was a knock off"" of OW, then you're cheating yourself out of one of the most fun competitive multi-player games on the market right now."
18515,"Is it an overwatch clone? Kinda. Sure, the hero abilities are overwatch hero abilities that are ramshackled together, but the loadout system allows you to play whatever character you want without having to follow a specific team comp/meta (though this is not an incentive to just ignore the warnings of ""No healer"" or ""No front line""). I'm having fun with it, just don't get your hopes up when you're crushing in the first 5 matches cause those are bots."
18516,fun

18518,FUNNNNNN!!!!
18519,"[b] [h1] I'm conflicted on this review and heres why! [/h1] [/b]


[h1] First the bad ugly truth [/h1]

Honestly i didnt want to start with the bad but it needs to be pointed out first so people get the general idea.
In my 215+ hours (at review time) it has become very apparent that the devs base the updates and fixes off of console play more than they do for PC.  At first i didnt see it after my friend mentioned it but after the huge update where they buffed everyone that really didnt need it it was so in your face saying ""hey the meta is different on console than it is on PC because we buffed koga and seris"" after that i was hit with confusion and just had to at that point come to terms with the idea that they base the changes on console play exclusively.

With that being said its still playable even with the buffs and changes but still there are people that need a nerf on PC and possibly console.

Another huge issue i have with Paladins is it seems they havent really given it the attention it needs/deserves with bug fixes. i know they addressed that they were going to update more often recently so it does give me more hope on this matter. but still there are a lot of small graphical issues and bugs that are minor and not game breaking that should have been scrubbed out months ago like At match end when you level up a season pass and click ""close"" and it replays the audio and pops the screen up again or like the small void/hole in the default Seris skin in her chest or my favorite when you earn rewards in a pop up screen for you to equip and nothing you do works so you have to sometimes close out of the game and restart it.

The Bounty tokens never worked for me so i reached out to them via twitter and got no response but instead was shocked to see they instead made an event for tokens a couple days after i reached out. On their twitter update everyone complained saying it doesnt work for them and if it does work the skins they bought just get taken away randomly. I recently was able to finally get tokens but now they are revamping it which is good. However they seem to not be aware it never really worked because they think everyone loves it when it never really worked on PC to begin with for me or a few friends. 

Proof other people had my issues and some worse like losing all acquired bounty tokens: https://twitter.com/PaladinsGame/status/1344674801793835012


[h1] The Good! [/h1]

Honestly i do like Paladins i really do. Paladins has a lot of potential and a really nice range of different characters. I see this game only getting better with more updates/changes. i personally prefer this instead of its ""competitor"" and will continue playing this often. im really looking forward to see what kind of direction Paladins will take."
18520,The game good but the randoms mad bogus and bring the top play back plz
18521,Its like another game minus the paywall and all the trashtalking over mains

18529,"All this game serves to be is a ""I don't wanna pay for overwatch"" In reality it isn't really better. All the problems of this game will never, ever be fixed. Because in the end this game will continue to be nothing but a clone. It has that issue of constantly adding characters when it could be better off just taking a season to actually fix the game. I hope this game never does go to anything beyond just a free overwatch, cause that's all it really is. Now having to pay 60 dollars to actually have every character in the game instantly, and not even having the ability to have every character onward. Just cough up the 20 dollars and play overwatch. Better lore, better characters, better mechanics, better everything. Genuinely hate this fucking game now."

18557,"Let me tell you about the infinite monkey theorum. The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.

Now, understanding the infinite monkey theorum, let me explain its application here. This game was made purely by chance of a bunch of monkeys slamming on a keyboard. Bugs that have existed since day 1 still exist. Every time an update is coming out, all they do is just consult the monkeys for their newest brilliant idea and then give them keyboards. Repeat the cycle."

<:"
18563,"I installed this game in March of 2017 on PS4 but it is basically the same nothing changes apart from the controls of course. I've had tons of fun and i must say that it is NOT an Overwatch clone. I have played both games for a decent amount of time especially Paladins (800+ hours). This is in my opinion a more ''casual'' game than Overwatch which is/was among the most popular games in the e-sports industry. Now, let's not drift away from the topic of review and actually talk about Paladins itself. Where can I start from? It gives players unlimited possibilities i.e. creating your card loadout and that is what makes this game WAY different from OW. There are literally so many ways to play a certain Champion by playing a bit with their cards. You can have 5 unique cards per loadout and each prioritize one aspect of a champion's arsenal (cooldown reduction, shields, health, crowd control). For instance you can play a Tank that is supposed to capture and stay at the point as a FLANKER. Let's take for example Fernando and his flamethrower. He has a huge ass shield that can absorb a lot of damage and that obviously makes him ideal for holding enemies off the capture point. However, some people prefer to play him as a flanker and rather focus on kills than being the actual frontline of the team. This applies to every champion of course and there are unlimited ways to play around them. This aspect of the game is what made me fall in love with it and play non-stop for a whole year. This was until OB64 came out and absolutely ruined the card system we all loved. I'm not gonna get into detail of what it did as it happened 3 years ago and I have a very long time to play Paladins (you can find about the infamous OB64 with a simple search). Anyways, I've had a shit ton of good memories playing this title with my buddies. Eventhough its may be seen as a less-polished version of OW with a card system to some peoples' eyes it will definitely spark your interest if you at least give it a try :)"
18564,fuck you jeremy
18565,hentai simulator
18566,only good if you dont have enough money for overwatch
18567,i love this game and it can be good but as long as the developers dont put all the love they can into it i cant recommend it to anyone. there is just to many bug and too much lag for the game to be considered playable. i will still play it in hopes that it will improve but i can never tell anyone else that they should play it

New accounts are able to play ranked, so the matchmaking is really bad and the games are not enjoyable at all. It will match Golds with Grand Masters, people dodge games all the time, and sometimes you have multiple hackers in one match. It also allows for everyone to have a smurf in ranked which creates an imbalance in the teams."

SKYE´s butt. her ravishing curvy and elegant lines elegantly and move as she explores the vast land. she dazzles like a star in the night. her stunning features brighten any room. she is the choosen one. i highly recommend this game.

18618,"This is the type of game you play to laugh at the jank, your character going off the ground, and casually play while chatting about random things such as the history of the Iberian Sausage, or how Sophos Safeguard may conflict with Adobe Acrobat's Asynchronous I/O routines needing a registry hack to disable that, or how the Energía / Buran stack would have mopped the floor with the American Space Shuttle, and Energía alone was powerful enough to send materials and crew back to the moon by the early 90's. Since nobody plays anything over than Siege Mode, really, this is a game you play to pass the time while chatting about random stuff.

3/10, would re-tell the history of the Buran Programme again."

18680,"Want to play a certain Hero Shooter but cannot afford the initial price-tag? Well you are in luck, because Paladins is here!
To be fair it has a lot to be desired but the gameplay-feel is certainly there even if I own other certain Hero Shooters, I would still come back to this one for some fun-time.
They overall did most things right except from a few small issues which honestly can be overlooked in favor of the good time, it is all a mindset on how someone can come in the game and either like it or not like it as much.
Either way if one is open to the experience they can certainly bring the value out of the game.
Recommended!"
18681,"The developers have no sense of balance, they'd literally fall over if they stood still. Most updates are just skins for the devs' favorite characters, and many of the skins look like 'lolies', it's rather disgusting

I don't support the domestic terrorist ORG Black Lives Matter nor do I support Transgenderism. This is the reason why i cannot recommend this game or play it anymore. Between multiple accounts across different platforms and hundreds of hours spent on this game.

18717,The game Overwatch wishes to be. Although I love D.va the most :c Paladins needs to buy D.va or something.
18718,kind of like among us but not really
18719,"As a supporter of this title since the Closed Alpha, I've loved this game. Before I ever was able to play Overwatch and sink too much time into it, I spent so much time on Paladins as a Founder. It has grown and changed a lot since then, but one thing always rings true; The Devs are Persistent in constantly making this game greater and greater. About every champion feels unique, and those that don't are normally a combination of your favourite abilities from multiple heroes from other games (like combining two Overwatch Heroes for example). Bugs aren't too common, and the gameplay loop in enjoyable.

IF I had to state any negatives, it's that the Anti-Cheat could use a little more work. It gets the job done, but every 50 or so matches, you may find someone who is blatantly using aimbot on someone like Viktor. Another downside would be the fact that there can be quite a long bootup time with that EasyAntiCheat. And Finally? Just not enough people use Comms. The Best way to play and enjoy this game is with Friends, and that is fairly easy with the Devs dedication to Cross-play and Cross-Progression (Thank god for my old Xbox One Founders Pass :P)

If you enjoy Team Based Hero Shooters, Paladins is a great and free entry point which you can easily pick up and play with friends, no matter their platform (and I really mean that, the Switch, PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game all run smoothly, and boot faster lol). If you enjoy a character who is on the free rotation, a lil' grinding and bam, go unlock them. But if you choose to support the devs and get the Founders Pack, all current AND future Champions are yours to keep and enjoy, and honestly, if you enjoy the game enough, it's cheaper than buying Overwatch and Worth It. But hey, I play and Enjoy both, and I hope you do too!~ <3

**UPDATE** After even more time, Cheating is seen alot less and the Bootup time with Anti-Cheat is alot faster now :3 New champions are really dynamic and alot of Fun, and even between Overwatch and Halo Infinite, I still find myself coming back to Paladins when I want to change it up a little. Still a high recommendation!"
18720,"Good game overall, but very annoying at times (especially the long cooldowns)"
18721,"It is not just an Overwatch clone, while it does have similar Abilityies and concepts, it takes whats good from the games around it and mixes it all together"
18722,"this game is dead and my teammates are shit, but game still go brrr"
18723,"POM,G 7UAES T HIS GAME SO GOOD LMAOOOO"
18724,uma m.e.r.d.a.
18725,very good
18726,"It's a fun game, I just wish they would fix some of the bugs that have been in the game for a while instead of making so many paid skins.

I had an issue where I linked my steam account, when I went to login the game wanted me to create a character name. I thought my progress had been deleted so I contacted customer support. They told me they gave everyone a free (optional) name change for linking to steam."
18727,"good game
yes yes
good"
18728,OVERWATCH 2 IS FINALLY OUT!!!
18729,e
18730,it is very fun and it is like overwatch but free 10/10 should play
18731,"Really AWFUL Gameplay the 3D models are really bad too. i cant even enjoy the gamemode at all....
can't recommend unless for your children maybe..... O_o"
18732,"fun game, although i was cheated out of my money i purchased deluxe edition and never recieved it"
18733,"Don't get me wrong, I love paladins. The maps are unique and there is a wide variety of playable champions. Not to mention its great concept that is pulled of quit well. However there are a number of serious flaws to the game. Some champions are stupidly unbalanced such as Lian with all of her abilities that deal damage and can easily be used to barrage and destroy single targets in a single second (unless its a front line), the new Lex rework allows players to melt enemies more easily than before and Zhin is just plain OP as a champion. There are also other problems with the game such as server lags and crashes where players may have to close and re-open the game while attempting to join a match. there are bugs even after the game has finished, where the game black screens and requires a restart once the match is over. I believe that the game devs should balance certian champs and fix these bugs before releasing more content. Since the release of the new (slightly unbalanced) champion, yagorath, they have already worked on and almost finished the next champion, Octavia, and another battle pass. The devs need to fix bugs with the current version of the game before adding more potential problems to the game.
This review isn't intended to come across as a hate comment, I have simply written this to provide constructive criticism for the developers.
if the developers can fix these bugs and balance the champions that require balancing, then i would totally recommend this game to others."
18734,its just free overwatch
18735,I played 3 hours. Was fun but than deleted it

18756,yes
18757,"I love this game, it makes overwatch seem boring.

BUT 

Horrible stability issues. The game crashes SO MUCH it's not even funny. 
When it's not an unreal engine crash it's just general server lag. 
They've been around for so long you would think stability would no longer be an issue, but nothing sucks more than crashing 4 times in a row trying to reconnect to a game you crashed out of. 

Game 10/10
Engine 2/10

18758,it is super fun

18772,cool game
18773,Rank is dead hackers are almost in every rank game. Rank matchmaking is unfair is not even close to picking same rank players u can even get grand master on the enemy team when u are in qualifications for ranks. There are a lot of trolls in the game so people derank on purpose because of them. After almost 500 h in the game is not fun on amusing to play anymore because of all those hackers and trolls. I banned at least 60 players on my account in the last 2 years. Some players have even there name hidden at the and of the match so u cant even report them on the official side. Some hackers accounts are not even found on the paladins guru or paladins-tracker.de its says theres no accout under that name and hi rez dosent care about that.
18774,"pretty fun
"
18775,Shit
18776,This game is so dead. Hackers in ranked. Toxic idiots in casual. No balance in casual. enemy players are 4 master 1 diamond and my teammates are 3 silver 1 gold. This game made me cancer. FUCK THIS GAME but not that much

18781,love this game but cant play on Linux so no more paladins for me
18782,creamy pasta
18783,OK
18784,"For being a free to play game it is full functional and completely playable without spending a penny. You  get gold at a decent rate and like most games like this there is a rotating roster so you always have new heroes to learn. Updates are frequent enough where things stay fresh. Some heroes seem a little under powered but for the most part the game seems well balanced. The games are short enough where you dont get burnt out on a single game. The longest game I had was around 25 minutes. A very good free to play game.

Edit: I have many more hours in the ps4 version but when I learned I couldnt do cross saves with ps4 I switched to pc."

18802,"Lots of customisation options for champions, and many different ways to play the game. I love the drafting system and how many different team compositions can work, along with having to stick with the champion you choose and not change mid-game. Only downsides are the lack of polish and persistent bugs, otherwise this is an amazing game."
18803,They Deleted my old account and I bought all the characters. I used to love this game.
18804,only paladins (sometimes fortnite)

18860,"fun game. I like the competetive aspect of it. But I have recently been having a lot of casual fun. I like how you can customize loadouts. Simple enough, but can get as complex as I wish for. The devs seem cool. I appreciate the transparancy. The game isn't perfect, but its still awesome in my opinion."
18861,good
18862,i love it when i get deserter
18863,"Nice game IG, played it a bit, not my cup of tea but you might like it"
18864,"I can't in all honesty recommend this game, I have some time in the game and the content, matchmaking, bugs, none of it is getting improved or fixed. It could be a great game but its just getting stale and ignored in place for whatever else they're working on."
18865,"Are there broken champions? Yes, a lot of them, however I think a good amount of this game's balance comes from the fact that are a lot of broken champions and compositions, allowing players to counter each other not by technicality but instead by skill and character power. Is the community toxic? Besides spamming quickchat, I don't really think so. Not a lot of people stop playing after 1 minute and start just harassing their team like in Overwatch, where you have a quitter every game. I will say the biggest glaring issue is probably the lack of skill based matchmaking. Yeah quickmatch is quickmatch but occasionally in ranked it'll throw a Gold 2 with a Silver 5, against a team with A Bronze 1 and a Silver 1, but 2 Gold 3's. I think players who consistently get high numbers per minute should be matched with players who do the same. Then people will pick characters that the haven't used before, which is fine in principal but there is no switching during matches. like don't pick a healer if you are only gonna get 5k healing in 12 minutes (this game deals in thousands not hundreds so that is inexcusably bad) especially when the dps have 90k dmg. Or vice versa people will quick lock dps roles and only deal 35k dmg in 12 mins."

18887,"THE GAME BROKE

Edit: the game still broke and hotboxes are getting even worse but they are trying their hardest to fix it which is fair enough still wouldn't  recommend playing it, as it is still plagued with smurfs"
18888,"Its alot more fun on console, for some reason it ed on my $2k laptop. I game with a controller and it wont let me select a champion at times i can do just about everything but that. I hold down A and it looks as tho I've selected my champ but when i release the button i get nothing"

18892,This is basically overwatch but alot easier. This game has alot of content and it is extremely fun to level up and get new character and customize them! 10/10 RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE WHO LIKE GAMES LIKE TF2 AND OVERWATCH ETC!!
18893,fun :)
18894,"pros: active discord & community, queue times are almost non-existant. better than overwatch

cons: it's not team fortress 2"
18895,"it is a nice game, but the removal of game modes, server problems, matchmaking, no longer showing other players ranks, only updating to add a new hero (no maps or modes for a long time), real money skins and battle passes makes the game very crap. it was fun when we had the 2 turns mode, where we had to go from a base to another with the payload, but that's gone. we can't test maps either. some heroes are stupid broken (cassie melting everything, koga can barely be catched, just as evie). not enough balance. it no longer is as fun as it used to be. also, for some reason you only have party chat, no all chat which is stupid. let the players flame the other team, not be mean to themselves and not wanting to play/go afk over an argument. it used to be more fun"

18904,the game became a huge disappointment when it went out of beta
18905,"MMR appears to be non-existent. So far, each game has been a steam-roll win or loss."
18906,game go brrrrrrrr
18907,I didnt expect paladins to be this good. I prefer it over overwatch.
18908,"cool maps and characters
"
18909,"Its a fun game to play
"
18910,"My honest opinion on Paladins,

The game has a lot of things going its way, mainly its addictive gamplay loop and in depth mechanics.
It has a few bugs here and there and it could always be better, but it is such a nice game to play, the experience is absolutely amazing.

It shouldn't be seen as an alternative to a paid game like overwatch, paladins is free and lets hope they keep it like that. It's an amazing game to play.

All and all, the game is great. Should check it out a solid 8/10 from me."
18911,"it feels like old overwatch
guns actualy damage"
18912,dragon go brrr

"
18914,like overwatch but you're allowed to have fun
18915,"Fun to play with friends and a lot of cool people to use. If you want another game to play aside from your usual rotation, Paladins is a good choice."
18916,"Amazingly fun game, but matchmaking is algorithmic and not random. Needs a more balanced approach. You either ""pwn"" the other team, or get pwned. When you do get a fair match, it's hella fun, but rare."
18917,no
18918,Fun!
18919,It's 130 hours good so far
18920,Trash and laggy servers were never fixed feels like just another milking game that parodies overwatch

18922,"always clowned on my nephews playing it. I gave it a shot with my 7yr old son and my wife and it has been fantastic, and brought us together in the murder of our enemies. 10/10"
18923,free overwatch
18924,Paladin's it's the best game
18925,"I miss this game. :( I used to love it so much to the point that i bought all the skins available at that time. Its been years since i quit. I forgot which update made the players quit which has led to the game being unplayable for solo players. (I mean you still can, you either just have to carry hard or keep losing) It doesn't have enough players to be balanced anymore. You'll get matched against organized high-ranking duos/trios/squads while you get randoms. If there was a neutral option, id pick it. The game is still decent but the playerbase is lacking."

18980,no
18981,"Paladins can definitely be fun, but also frustrating for sure. Some things are definitely unbalanced in this game, and the players aren't really the nicest either. But there are definitely good moments too. It's a game I got addicted too quickly because of the diverse roster of champions, and I've grown a liking to a lot of them. They are definitely working on making their game much better, but one thing that also bugs me are the chests in-game. I swear, everytime I want a certain skin from a chest it's always the last skin I get, and I don't know if that's just bad luck, or if the game just knows, but it always ends in me spending more money to get crystals just for the skin I want. Bugs are also a problem in this game, but for a while I'm not really experiencing them that much so they're not a problem for me. Other than that, the game is fine. :)"
18982,"Listen, I have 600+ hours in Paladins. I don't buy heroes with crystals because I've earned them slowly over years using the free earnable credits.
[b] The characters I'm now saving for are: [/b]
Octavia, Bomb Queen, Saati
VII, Vatu, Vora,
Azaan,
Rei, Damba, and now Lilith.

[b] My gripes with the game are: [/b]
[i]
-The game needs a sequel by now. Its old. The progression. The new gamemodes they made;
-There's too many furry heroes;
-There's lots LOTS (can be good, can also feel pointless) of heroes. Some feel like copy-pastas that only offer qol points on top of their older versions(old v new sniper heroes). Why grind forever when you own all roles as playable options. Owning all heroes isnt worth it.
-Ranked placements, from what I've heard for years, is totally pointless (because the ranked community died for a time causing mm to pick RANDOM players for teams at times);
-and the game's still a crashing, buggy mess for many people. [/i]


It's a painful situation to become a viral alternative to OW for a year or so, then slowly become forgotten because the devs didn't capitalize on innovating the game. It's a fun game, but mistakes were made. Mistakes were made... they weren't addressed. They weren't addressed. Where does the game go from here than a game that addresses issues which also restores our hope in an expanded Paladins universe.

[i]
I mean... AT LEAST ITS NOT LIKE OW2. [b] *LMAO [/b]
sigh... 
because hi-rez hasnt done much on a sequel yet. Hi-Rez, please, just make a newer, more stable, sequel to Paladins. The old community would love to return to this franchise. [/i]"

19029,"So, you want my honest review of paladins?
Well ive been here for a while and followed this game through good times and bad times.
Ive known Paladins since 2016, and 5 years later i still love this game.
But this game is not flawless, so if you plan on playing the game im not going to advice you, or not.
Instead ill give you the good points and bad points about this game so you can formulate your own opinions.

Good Points:
[list]
    [*]This game provides a ranged variaty of play styles so you can change your role in game even if you are using only 1 character
    [*]All characters played effectively can either control the battlefield or have the biggest impact in game, so it dosent matter who you main, it will always have an impact
    [*]Useless characters is something this game knows very little about, since all characters lack a playstyle, giving YOU, the player, the option to play it as you want
    [*]All characters feel smooth when playing them, and most importantly all ultimates are FAIR. Since after you ult, the enemy has 2 seconds to react to your ultimate making escapes easier and not feel like a ""win the game button"" 
    [*]The Game rewards gameplay mechanics over lone wolfers, since you only have 5 players in a team and there are 4 class's in the game, eventually you'll realize that if you want to win you need to adapt making the game feel way to third dimensional and open to different playstyles
    [*]All Maps are perfectly symetrical so the player can guarrentee a free push if they know the map well enough, making counterplays easier since all of the map works as a single point with a payload
    [*]The System of cards Unbound is by far the biggest and most important part of the gameplay, a system that allows, you the player, to costumize your character with a hide spectrum of choices making you able to play the game as you want, not as you are told
    [*]Playing the game and getting better at it its crucial to more wins, but for the low average player the game has you squared, the game queues you in bot matchs for you learn the mechanics, but even after that if you feel like you want to learn more characters, the game still gives you the option to go for bot matchs until you are ready for the main game, making the game EXTREMELY GOOD for new-commers
    [*]The Game offers you a spectrum of champions to fill your every desire, and every 3 months a new char comes along.

Bad Points:
[/list]
[list]
    [*]This game's servers are a mess, usually you'll have your internet completly ok and be sliding in and out of combat.
    [*]The Hitboxes are squared much like unreal tournament and quake's, and the game offers you auto aiming abilities, and its pretty annoying some times
    [*]Remember how i said ""The game dosent know useless characters?"" well but it does know overpowered characters, and depending on your skill you might disagree with me, but arguably Vivian and Moji will most likely be your biggest problems since both have way to busted kits making them killing machines at basicly any range.   
    [*]This game suffers from microtransactions, since you can technically buy your way into a primed account with barelly any effort and getting in 50$ what you would normaly need 500+ hours of gameplay to get.
    [*]Some systems that the game provides you are incredibly flawed sometimes, and this is specially true when it comes to AI. When your teammates leave the player will get replaced by an AI but the AI, is coded that if it hits a wall it will still move against the wall until 5 seconds later it changes to a new wall acomplishing nothing in the process
    [*]The Entire Ranked System has a huge flaw that makes ranked grinding tedious and really unfunny, since you can be a platnium player trying to have fun and getting queued against a duo of grandmasters and get demolished
    [*]Yes, skins, the problem isnt actually the skins, is the amount of skins each character recieves compared to anothers, Let's look at Maeve for example, she owns more than 12 skins while characters like Evie have 3 tops, so the devs clearly have biased opinions towards which champs deserve more than others.
    [*]90% of the community tent on giving this very bad feeling in game, mostly for the toxicity.
    [*]This game is a mess when it comes down to player skill levels, since there isnt an Match Making lvl it can pair you up with people that have been playing for 2 days with people that have been playing since Alpha.
[/list]

Now i do have to mention the elephant in the room, YES it is a f2p game, but because of the micro-transactions i cant fully acknowledge it as a F2P Game.
Now about my honest opinion in the long term.
Yes the game does become very stale after a couple of weeks/months HOWEVER, the game lets you choose how to handle the gameplay through Cards Unbound System.

So? What do i, Syrex think of this game? 8/10 for new players and then a 6/10 for old players or veterens. but what do you think? let me know in the comments.

19054,"though i have paid money for this game and have no idea about the slow progression of gaining champions, i can say this game is one of my favorites. The loadout and card system allow for a wide range of different playstyles on one champion, let alone on all the different ones. I just love the gameplay. I personally have trouble finding toxicity in the community as well. Experiences can differ, but from my personal experience, the game is just fun."

19082,Very entertaining
19083,"Think this...Rogue Company meets Smite. Pretty much. Has a battle pass system. I've gotten it less than a week ago, and easily keeps me interested. Very fun."
19084,Nice game
19085,I had written a whole essay about this game but it was kinda cringe especially since people don't read reviews for free to play games. If this game wasn't free to play I would have never played it.  It was great to begin with but slowly fell off. I would recommend it for people wanting to play a game that scratches the same itch as overwatch but I wouldn't get too serious about it.

19092,"If what matters to you is having fun playing a game like me, then I would definitely recommend Paladins. Less Toxicity and highly enjoyable compared to League of Legends which is so damn stressful and you can't survive playing solo there unless you're a pro."
19093,Used to waste my time a lot here.
19094,yeah rip my eyes
19095,Pretty good game! I really like it!
19096,"Pros : It's free. A lot of players too so easy to find a match. The game also fun with a lot of champions to play with.

Cons : It took long enough for a new champion to come in to the game (I believe it almost like 1 champion in a year). It's so hard to unlock a champion because it costs a lot. Also lack of new map, its boring to play a little map pool."
19097,I liked the gameplay.
19098,"If you ever played Overwatch or would like to get into a game like overwatch (but for free) this is the perfect game for you. It has a similar gameplay and heroes, but with the added legendary and item mechanics, I think the game adds a great layer to this type of game. 

Since it is free-to-play, there's a lot of stuff you can purchase (cosmetic only). The only thing I can say about this is that I wish the items were less expensive... Like, if they were, I would invest money, but I don't see myself paying that much for just one (or 2) cosmetic items."
19099,Very fun to play with friends
19100,gg
19101,reminds me of my 8th grade times
19102,I recommend this game for people who just got a pc and can't find any games. I have been playing this game a lot when this game came out on switch and got it on pc to try it out. Its fun just to play when you dont have any game to play on your steam library.
19103,this game is awful
19104,It is kool
19105,:)
19106,"The game really isn't just an Overwatch clone. There are so many little effects that make the games fundamentally feel different that I'd still suggest people to try it out even if they're skeptical. After all, what is there to lose? It's free."

19114,Game is fun
19115,"They ban your account with no reason, i haven't been playing for a while and tried to come back but my account was banned. I have paid money for some packs and did nothing in game to deserve a ban. 

Never spend a penny in this game is my greatest advice to any player who wants to play this because for no reason you will feel scammed and stolen.

It feels so wrong the society we are growing with and that i have to write a review in here with no notice of why my account was banned while i was away."
19116,pretty good.
19117,It's like Overwatch except they didn't f*ck up the game
19118,:D
19119,"I played almost 50 hours of the game, just to find out that you can't do your ranked placements with more than 2 people, and if you reach diamond or above you can only have parties of 2. It ruins any incentive of playing with friends as there is no point of trying to climb in ranked only to not be able to play with your friends when you get in the higher ranks."

19134,"There is a problem with cheaters, but it's not absolutely game-breaking.  The game is fun and well made, and runs on any number of older and newer machines.  Not a bad experience altogether.  I wish I could give the game a thumb-sideways.  It's good, but the cheaters threaten to ruin the experience every single day.  Aimbots and wallhacks are just too normalized.  I can't be a part of such a careless system.  They don't even have an option for reporting cheaters.  That's how carefree they are about the problem...

The problem is so bad lately, that I waited 20 minutes to enter a game with 2 aimbots on the enemy team.  Impossible levels of tracking and headshot frequency.  The game is dying, and the developers do not seem to care."
19135,"a lot of champions (characters)

19144,Great game to download for free and mess around of have fun. Has options were you can pay to unlock characters but it also is not hard to unlock characters just by playing the game.

19183,Paladins is a great and fun game to pass time and to take seriously. It is distinct and different enough to other games with the same premise so the comparisons shouldn't be taken into account while playing this game.
19184,once you figure out what in sam hell your doing its a pretty fun thing
19185,Game full of lesbians
19186,good
19187,"Paladins is truly a game i would forever remember:

Some matches you would win easy while other matches you could loose hard its really a 50/50 change winrate tipe of game. If your the tipe who is looking for a shooter game to enjoy i'll recomment this game. Yes it has its pro and cons but at the end all games has its own problem. they struggle with bugs every patch but they work hard into fixing it as fast as they can. Ive been playing this game for years and ive never seen a hacker on this game ever only really skilled people. No one plays  the characters the same that keeps the game unique your either really good balanced or bad at a character  so you would have characters you love playing and some you never play. 

Its that tipe of game that every match is not played the same. How this game works is you have a point to capture (circle in the middle) which you have to contest for to earn the payload (a cart full of explosives) that you must push to the enemies team point circle near there spawn. First one to 4 points win the match wins and its called Siege.

There are 3 other game modes Tmd,Onslaught where Onslaught have two modes a 
King of the hill: where the point stays one place
Normal Onslaught: where the point change potition every few minutes to be recaptured. 
Team Death Match aka Tdm is just a deathmatch where the winning team wins after they get 40 kills first but Onslaught uses point up to 400 you can get points by killing an apponent or by just capturing the point.

There are 4 tiers of character groups:
Tank
Dmg
Flank
Healer

its very important to have a character in each tier on your team to have a balance team and have a high winrate chance. there are 5 in each team so you can have all the tiers in your team and have a second slot for a exstra tier like if you want 2 healers to keep your team viable or in most casses 2 tanks for one on point and one off point to help other tiers to defeat there opponent. 

There servers are always stable and works good internationally so if you have good wifi it will feel like a breeze. Always a fun game and have its funny moments its only rank where people get toxic so i recommend finding friends to party up with that you know how they play and what they're are good at and what not.

Lovely skins for each character and they did a pretty good job on the new maps revamps it looks amazing. It may be the same gamestyle everytime but it wont be the same gameplay everytime i wish they could just bring back the end screen for the mvp it really boosted people's will to do better to get that spot filled its hard to tell your team you got quadra, penta or hexa kill if they cant even see it for them selfs. I enjoyed it so much when my fav character pops up and its me if i did something really amazing. 

The new system always highlights the boring stuff and does'nt  even show the WOW stuff you did pretty good in a match. Atleast highlight or recolor the multi kills and instead of calling it multi kills and a number say that this person had a for example: dubble, triple, quadra, penta, hexa -kill where hexa can be in a gold color or like a diamond color form so that it stands out.

I would recomment them to add the ability to be able to download your previous match so you can see how you played or be able to clip a funny moment or a well played match that your team or you did. i really would loved to see such moments again or be able to stream my demo to friends and show off my recent matches i did something good or hilarious. 

overall ill rate this game a 4,5/5 star cause the Hi-Rez and Evil Mojo staff really put efford in paladins and i hope it will be with us for many more years :)

19188,"good game,it`s not just a version of overwatch it is a great game,great champions"

19190,I've played this game on this pc and xbox and it is so fun i just wish skill based matchmaking wasnt so broken
19191,"my strix alays bugging, he cant move forard and every scoping is freezing, cant move anything"
19192,"Actually a pretty nice game, only flaw would be that there's always a guy who's AFK in your lobby when you launch a game but that's not the fault of the game."
19193,gud but very much inspired by Overwatch. THink the art is much better
19194,nice game
19195,"this is a really good game
"
19196,.
19197,"They release a new champion every 3 minutes, and fix no bugs... They will legit have no more character ideas soon, they are already at that point they just reskin and rename the skills of the new champions from ones they already have. By middle of the year they will have 4,500 champions and no new maps or bug fixes... Game was so good in beta, complete dog $hit now. Super sad to see, the devs dont give a crapppppppppola"
19198,the game is so cool
19199,gud game
19200,"Great game,"
19201,best game eva

19203,"No its awful seriously I really enjoy it but mainly to laugh at how awfully shit this dumpster fire cover up for a ""game"" this is.

haha it just gets worse"
19204,"Yeah, we're still in 2021 and this game has 0 support for Linux, so.... don't waste ~20gigs of storage on your hdd trying to play this unless you're willing to dual boot Windows (ew)"
19205,VEREE nike gAM
19206,Dead Game
19207,"There's nothing in the game market that really feels like Paladins. 

I have bought Overwatch and have some fair play time there too, and i can say, for all the faults of Paladins, I still think Paladins is a better and more fun game.

Everyone here can carry a game, you are not locked as healer/utility/tank only champion. The improvement of skills, mastery system and items give the characters much diversability, changing them in the some way, you can make a healer a better healer or make him a carry or flank. Funny to see.

The developers almost killed the game sometime ago with bad changes, but they reverted it. Let's hope they don't any major mistakes again, because it was very hard to recover from that. This is the best hi-rez game i have played.

Some champions visual design are kind generic, but the majority of them have a nice and fun gameplay. Overall is a good game."
19208,"Fun game, easier version of Overwatch but it has taken the number 1 spot over OW for me. Blast to play with friends, skill based sometimes feels unbalanced but nothing a little alcohol doesn't fix."
19209,Fun game
19210,"This game is fun, and boy, I like fun!"
19211,"its a good game and in my opinion its better then overwatch the main reason why is the community in paladins isn't salty and my only gripe with paladins is how long it takes to unlock characters but that's no reason not to play the game. and the graphics they aren't the best but they are playable, and the requirements fore running the game are extremely small so a literal potato could play this game well on minimal graphics of course. but basicly the games good and i think anyone whos looking for a team based first person shooter should try it you don't have to like i'm just saying give it a try."

19216,"Help, I can't stop playing it, noooo..."
19217,"This game is not playable anymore. Dozens of bugs, shit matchmaking (queuing you with lvls 30, while enemy have grandmasters), you don't even need aim because of these crap hitboxes, balance is trash as well. Instead of fixing the game developers just make another furry skins"
19218,Good game to play with friends. And it's f2p. Perfect !

19232,it is a very good game.
19233,it stop working for me which it  is sad due to some missing program and steam was no help and trying to fix it by myself was not working but my time playing it was good am just sad I cant play it anymore.
19234,"When my grandfather passed away last year, I lost all hope and fell into a deep troublesome depression that consumed my entire life. My wife left. I lost my job. I lost everything. Everything except for Paladins. 10/10 
Will recommend to friends if i ever make any!"
19235,ttttt
19236,"Game is alright and fun, or at least it would be if certain characters weren't horribly unbalanced. These OP characters are the meta that you will see in almost every match and so the game gets boring since you will only really be fighting the same few characters such as Lex, Io, and Kinessa. Io is a huge offender in being unbalanced with DPS that rivals damage classes and a healing summon that is way too durable, on top of that, Io can use the summon as an extra life to negate any attack, including ults. 

Imbalances like this just make the game feel unfun as most deaths you get aren't even because of something you did. It is usually just you get random insta-killed by a character you can't even react to.

And that isn't even getting to the amount of hackers in the game. People who (after doing calculations) were doing more than 4 times the DPS their character was capable of.

All of this boils down to a half-assed competitive game that whilst fun at times, Leaves very little room for skill or fun when played. Even with friends, most matches just come down to a halt of ""Well great, they are using THAT character, guess we lose""

And to top it off, Half of the teammates you get stuck with are just bots or trolls that sit at spawn, purchase no items, and do nothing to help the team."
19237,"toxic playerbase, unbalanced characters"

19276,it is a very good and fast action pact game
19277,Moji
19278,Very balanced and fun to play even alone.
19279,i accidentally spent €10 on this game and i couldn't get it back
19280,"Insane game, so amazing wow. Stopped playing this game when i got overwatch. Came back to it as a meme. TBH this game bops. Play bomb king for free win."
19281,.
19282,"best FREE first person shooter
better than TF2 in fact, 10x better

graphics: 9.7/10

gameplay: i play almost every day

fps i get: about 40 on max with my decent computer

downsides:
nerf yagorath please he is op

pay 2 win:
not really just gems that are really expensive that can get you more champions and skins

pc requirements:
decent

note: turn off voice chat because it can be annoying with people screaming, other than that great game but it takes up a lot of space(worth it) best character that is 30,000 coins is probably drogoz or fernando
best 60,000 coin: yagorath he op"
19283,"Honest Review from someone whose clocked thousands of hours on FPS Games over the past 17 years.

The only thing this game has in common with Overwatch is that they both brought about a new Category of First Person Shooter. The closest you'd get to this once upon a time was on CS:S on the Surf RPG Maps.

I like Paladin's, its characters are fun and the mechanics are interesting.

But I cant recommend it because to fully enjoy the game with Battle Passes you need to spend €60 as most of the characters are hidden behind that big Pay Wall. Now, I'm an adult whose had his own company, I get it. You need to make money but the reason company's charged €60 in the first place was because you were getting a physical Cartridge/disc, a case, a manual and sometimes a map or a poster too.

Overwatch is similar and costs a fraction of the price to enjoy fully.

You do the math."
19284,great game!
19285,It's very gay

i've been around for the ups and downs, including OB64. 

I'm still here. This game could be so much better if the devs got more funding from the publisher. Please support."

19329,Fun game but a bit pay to win
19330,.
19331,"It's a pretty fun game. Pretty much kind of like a broke boi Overwatch. It's fun though. I played Vivian, and it was SOOOO FUN. Her alt is insane and it's a grind."
19332,Fun! Especially with friends!
19333,e
19334,I liked how chill and fun the game is. No need to go sweaty every time you play. Can if you want to though and its a game for anyone and everyone. 10/10 with friends
19335,"Fun and complex 5v5 hero shooter, loadouts are fun and funky way to get the competitive spectrum more interesting. The anti-cheat is either really good or no one bothers to hack in the which I see as a win anyway, 10/10 would recommend."
19336,"I would recommend this game since it is fun to play a lot of the characters. However, if you plan on playing ranked I strongly recommend playing in a full squad since 90% of the player base is hard to queue with and the match making is not skill based. This means that you have a higher chance of queuing against higher ranking people or lower ranking team mates that should not be in your game. From personal experience, I was grinding out of platinum and my team's average in terms of ranking is gold since we had 1 person in bronze and 1 person in silver. TLDR; I lost that game and it caused me to stick to casuals due to that kind of match making.  Overall, a good alteration to OverWatch with a lot more strategic approach to payload.

Just a little FYI, do not unlink your steam account for paladins since you run the risk of losing your account and starting over again."
19337,ok
19338,BESR GAME EVR AMNEME
19339,very gud game

19376,"very entertaining, if you are looking for a slower passed overwatch that lets you have fun this us it!"
19377,"Good to play with friends, needs improvement in balancing and in team-banning. You have 40-50+ champions and only 2 bans? like when you expect to increase the bannings? Also any game with 40-50-100+ classes/champions Is unbalanced, always. But generally awesome game, I barely encounter toxic people but/when/if I do.. I just mute them and report them for harassment. This game is too good and fun to play to have toxicity."
19378,"Its a different paced game than Smite with some different objectives to play. It's a game to jump between both of when one becomes to repetitive. Overall, it's fun to play, especially with friends."

19397,VERY FUNNY HAHAHAHHA
19398,"Welcome to the game where you're expected to fill in the tank or healer spots, all the dps have instantly locked in their choice and are spamming you to tank/heal.
Enjoy the next few hours of this on repeat, watching as your dps don't even know what end of their weapon to point at the enemy.
Eventually you'll get a match, both teams are even, no one has chosen any of the bullshit overpowered premium champions. You'll have fun, lots of it. And now you'll need to slog through the next several hours of unbalanced teams and 5 man automatic doomstacks. to chase that high again.
Don't do this to yourself, go play something more fun."
19399,overwatch cloned this game
19400,gg
19401,"meh meh. its ok ish

still the same opinion. game's got a few bugs and balance issues... but good ish.."

19403,GREAT
19404,like a overwatch fork
19405,good game!
19406,"Its really great and a lot of fun when It doesn't keep crashing on me. Will play it more when It fixes the crashes 

Its ight now *22/09/2021*

Its taken my soul, with some (a lot) of the bugs *13/01/2022*

Its a lot better now, I've managed to get my soul back. Still has a few bugs but knowing how small their team is and limited resources they have. I think they're doing a good job. the game for me is 99% playable, with that sweet 1% chance of it crashing. I really do recommend this game but I do have to say. that a side of the paladins community is starting to get more toxic and more hackers are coming out and about. I do hope Evil Mojo will fix this as well as us the players help them get rid of the hackers and toxicity *25/04/2022*"

19415,"play this game instead of overwatch, its better than overwatch now"
19416,"It is deeply regrettable. In summary, game is unbalanced, it does make a difference if you play as healer or flank, damage is the same for everyone. I tried it as well on switch and it usually crashes, I thought that wouldn't happen on PC, however, same thing. In the end, it's free, that the only reason why people should give it a try I think."
19417,ok game ig

19431,This game used to be fun now it is the most painful game to play starting from the horrible community of people who play. Do yourself a favor and play literally anything else because the people who do play this game will not welcome new people only bring you down.
19432,no
19433,Excellent free to play.  Servers are usually wonky but that's what you get with a free game.
19434,Nice game.
19435,yes
19436,"this game is fun to play with friends, because you can plan the strategies before playing the game and get the best team power. Please give us more maps for more fun game play."
19437,"Very fun. The game has a wide variety of champions, which can be changed with decks for further customization. Love the game, enjoy it a lot more than Overwatch. Plus it's free!"
19438,mantap
19439,the most fun game
19440,"Yes this game does feel like a ""budget Overwatch"" sometimes and Yes many of the characters feel like they have just been copied straight out of Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm, League of Legends and many other favourites.. but! Before you dismiss it: it is Free To Play! And there are some really interesting character build mechanics that allow for very personalised play style. So. It's FREE. Why not give it a go?"
19441,"hmm looks like a nice game

19451,~ Paladins : Toxicity of the Realm ~
19452,"Paladins shouldn’t be seen just as the free alternative to Overwatch but, instead, should be praised as one of the best multiplayers nowadays. A great and addictive game that will surely entertain every kind of player thanks to its accessibility and well-developed mechanics."
19453,IT GUD PLAY NOW
19454,nice
19455,its a good game but its kinda hard to make coins
19456," Paladins is a lot of fun to have if you don't have access to a game like Overwatch, although there are some fun aspects it's basically the same game but with some fun quirks. I'll give it a 6.5/10 because it's not really original but it is pretty fun!"

19461,"I really like the game, but the fact I can't leave a match when I want to to go join a game with my friends is completely IMPOSSIBLE, is complete BS!!! At that point I just quite out the game and stop playing completely, and switch to a game that is more competent in that area..."
19462,Its a free version of overwatch. So if ur cheap and cant buy overwatch then get this.
19463,"Basically a free version of Overwatch, yet somehow pretty high quality. Would definitely recommend to people who can't afford Overwatch or even fans of Overwatch looking for something new."
19464,good game
19465,it good
19466,better than overwatch and free so kinda vibe
19467,Great with friends. Terrible if you don't like bugs. It's F2P Overwatch with no role block and loadouts.
19468,k
19469,"pog
"
19470,"At it's core, this is just an Overwatch clone. It's a good Overwatch clone, mind you, for the most part, except for when new champions are released. Usually the devs temporarily shadow-nerf whatever came before in order to get people to buy the new ones, so don't play outside of bot matches right after updates. For whatever reason the characters with either tits or fur (more often both) are regularly ""rebalanced"" to be more powerful.
If you have Overwatch, don't bother with this. Otherwise, knock yourself out."
19471,its good.

19476,"it's a good game but if the devs would work harder on it than rather abandon it... all would be good, hell they could even come out with a sequel like overwatch since they have similar gameplay"
19477,really fun and free
19478,bring back 3rd personn
19479,Peace of sh*t. With bad graphics and bots on the firsts levels. Better buy overwatch on sale for 9 euros and play good game.

19484,"Gets about 3 heroes in 5 months, Overwatch gets 3 heroes in 5 years. Quit overwatch for this, never looked back, will support the game until its bitter end."
19485,"Warning this games is not for who wants a competive match and even the devlopers are focusing on casual player more than competive. There is ranked to play but the matchmaking and ban system suck ass.
u will find hackers once a week and feeders all game even it high rank like master or diamond u will find feeders and low rank player on your team. The most problem is that  the devs wont do anything to this feeders and they  will only care about your money for the event pass.

If u want a casual experiese than this game is for u. The hitbox is ez for noobs to shoot and some chapion does not even need aim or skill .

19511,"""its alright, I don't play it anymore because of the toxicity of players and it gets old real quick to have ""teammates"" that throw. I'm probably just burnt out from the game being that i have played over 1000 hours on it. Also comparatively to TF2 its meta or get shit on basically. Hence why im on TF2 more cause i can dick around and no one cares 90% of the time. I wouldn't knock it till you try it. I have had genuine fun from it. Also be wary that it is F2P but, all but basic champions are locked behind a paywall of $30 unless you want to grind gold to get all unlocked.""

19588,"been playing this game for EONS now. game has the most toxic community in history. like they flame you for literally everything. ITS WORSE THAN LEAGUE OF MEANIES.

But you should definitely play it if you like deperation/addiction and stress.

+RECOMMENDED!"
19589,"I like this game for the sole reason as it's a time waster, when I have time to kill and want to play a game I'm not heavily invested in, this is the game. 
It's quick pace nature keeps you entertained throughout any situation of boredom, including being locked inside.
To be fair, I wouldn't play this game for any other reason than that, the community can be really toxic for no reason and a lot of people end up throwing. Just play at own risk"

19602,Amazin game better than overwatch best part its free the problem i have is the match making they sometimes let you play with seasoned players when you are a begginer
19603,I highly recommend you to play this game super fun.
19604,"The balancing is outright non-existent, the game loves to favour some characters because they appeal to edgy 13 year-olds, horny weebs and furrries. As much as i have no problem with those people, baiting them to play your game because you can't hold a firm playerbase is pathetic. This not only causes the developers to make some champions completely broken and yet extremely easy to play, it also makes the game uninteresting as you constantly see the same characters in every match, with minimal variety. Matchmaking is even worse.

19620,:)
19621,"Fun and easy to get into for an evening, Overwatch-esque but so far seems a bit closer to TF2. Probably wouldn't play it regularly but free rotation, presets and auto-buy make it easy to get started.

Customization is tied to the character, with three main talents and secondary cards that allow fine-tuning your main abilities.

I'd recommend playing with a few friends so you can make sure there's at least one tank and heal."
19622,maeve gut
19623,"No.
I can take bad balancing but this is just stupid.
You have characters who can hard counter other characters, and you can't do jack about it.
Once you pick your character, you're stuck with it. No wonder this game died off so fast. Who tf wants to sit around getting their ass handed to them with nothing they can do about it?"

19633,"Garbage shit game that is not worth your time,only damage and flank users play this game 
first the matchmaking is suck even if your level 200 u get placed with low level and if your low level u get placed against level 300
second this game is dead trust me,from 47 champions only 10 are playable and if you want damage dealer u only have maeve, andro,lian and vora cuz those 2 are op and ez to play u will see 90% of the time ppl playing those champions and ez win and u can't stop them cuz they just op,they deal damage,escape easily,healback then kill u all in less than 8 seconds 
Third. there's 0 balance between the heroes. either too bad like torvald or too op like maeve
4- this game logic is you have support champion that heal your allies then 90% of your heals get blocked by the enemy,at least give me 30% of it so tanks can survive,and all support heroes are like small fish to enemy damage dealers,they may have abilities to escape but in game they got no chance against flanks and damage. (the truth) 
5.before u start playing casual just check the champions abilities and cards in training and u will see how some of them are 
op, like victor has talent he just need to run and he restore hp,while maeve has talent were she can auto kill u if you at 30% hp. i played many similar games including overwatch which surely require more skills, and i can tell this game needs %10 skill because this game pretty much provide u all the factors to be good in the game u just need to pick one of those 10 playable heroes or pick one of those 4 damage dealers the rest is all up to u picking the right op talents like spam 600 damage per second with andro talent were u get 50 kills per game lol and picking cards that help u with ammo and cooldown and the items for example haven to reduce the damage u take from enemy.
And trust me whoever say there's balance between the champions his clearly in safe sport which means his someone with level 200 androxus or level 150 maeve and these idiots don't give single f about this game cuz they only play one hero and don't care about anything else"

19656,This game is overall a very strong game in all honesty the people who say this is a copy of so and so (most of the time overwatch) are wrong overwatch has a very different style and method of making characters while paladins not only has very very strong design since every character with few exceptions look great and you have skins like raeve maeve the entire remix battle pass the battle byte battle pass is a plus there are a few balance issues but they fixed the egg hitboxes so the game is very fun it has its pros and cons compared to other games of its kind the talents are unique Vora maeve seris ying inara and imani all feel very unique and most if not every character that was once OP was nerfed and jenos and maeve that used to be bottom tier got buffed and they are very fun

19667,Paladins is one of those games you play with your friend and improve your bond and friendship guys lets be real it's fun it's exciting some ups some downs but at the end of the day you come together with your friend(s). my friend and I are returning after a few years and we're hoping to re-kindle our friendship from what it once was. good luck to everyone playing the game and i'll see you in the battle!
19668,Paladins is a fun game but like most their are a few toxic players but only a few the game if free and i enjoy playing

A lot of fun with friends especialy for older players like me and my friends who don't want to invest time to master a more competitive game like apex or call of warzone  which is harder to master and where i personally, as a noob, often die instant after having runned around without meeting a soul for 20min give me a slap try again, die, go making my self a coffe, try again, die, cry, try again, die n' go take a shit, close the computer and go read a book and socialize or something. If you don't want to have to socialize and read any books well, this game is for you.

19676,"it is an amazing game, I've had many hours as you can tell and the game is not pay to win. its play to win. the more you play the more you get. i have all but three champions and i have only spent 5$ on skin packs. great game, great people. much diversity with powers and passives it makes for fun and interesting battles and strategy that is as fun as ever, if you have the people to stratagize with.

19686,"Patch rarely being released making the game feels the same and stale. The only update I've ever seen is bad skins. Instead of nerfing the obviously broken champion, they did so on those that the community never complaints about."
19687,"It's ok. It has some systems that make it feel different than a game like Overwatch, which has a lot of simularities to this one. I kinda prefer this one over that to be honest. I was away for a while and now I have a lot of new playables to mess with, so that makes it even nicer for me."
19688,its just overwatch if it was good
19689,please no
19690,The game doesn't know what balanced mean. sooo every charter kills u in half a second
19691,nice geam
19692,grasty
19693,"It's a hero shooter game with classes which is very similar to Overwatch , but the main difference that makes Paladins better for me is the personalization and the adjustments you can make to a character to match your game style , such as talents and card loadouts. It makes it so you have options and you can play the same character a bunch of different styles. Also you can buy in-game items to help you counter the enemy champions, once again, options!  Also right now there are 47 champions in the game , most of then unique and 27 different maps.Yes you read that right, 27! 
The only downside of the game is that sometimes in can be a little buggy but nothing major. If it wasn't for the blizzard's  hype of Overwatch  , Paladins would be so much more popular. It does everything Overwatch does, but better!"
19694,this game be crashing to much and its filled with bugs
19695,"Played on both console and PC and man I love this game, its great for when I just wanna relax but still play a team shooter"
19696,Everything about this game is fun there are plenty of champions for you to choose from some with really low skill caps and others with high skill caps for the more dedicated players but in the end everything is balanced the game does not require hours of play time to be good the ranked system is also really fun you are always put with players of similar skill and I also love the custom loadouts you can make with the card to give you the advantage in certain situations.
19697,"from the couple hours i've played this game is really fun. if you like that shit stain game called overwatch you will adore this. it's more fun than overwatch in my opinion, the characters are interesting and the abilities are fun to use. i main raum and love tanking everything and living lmao. i recommend this to fans of team-based fps games with moba elements with interesting match types."

19735,"Came out long after Overwatch and there are MANY similarities between the two. I mean even half the characters are practically direct copies of all the skill-sets. There is more than one character that you could say ""inspiration from Overwatch"" would be a massive understatement. So, you wouldn't be totally wrong in thinking that this game is a ripoff of Overwatch. However, as a veteran of Overwatch with hundreds of hours, I can comfortably say that Overwatch largely pales in comparison to how fun Paladins is. Granted, there is an abundance of 12 year olds that just wanna run around an shoot stuff and that's terribly annoying when they cost you the match, but it's worth it since it is so much more fun. Overwatch is built in a way where you NEED to find that character you're compatible with. There is no scraping by with a character, there is no just playing as Genji in Overwatch to just fool around. In Paladins, you can choose any character and after a brief period of learning their skills, you should be able to adapt and play as that character, have some fun and not die every 30 seconds. Paladins is more fun, with more characters, better commentary, better skins, wider variety of characters and character types. In short, uninstall Overwatch, play Paladins!"
19736,Make the servers more stable.
19737,super fun
19738,its okay
19739,Paladins is fun.............
19740,"I don't play this at all on PC so excuse my hours, 

But compared to OW, this is arguably more fun than OW. It's free, so there is no reason that you wouldn't give this a try. It's more fun with friends, and with the introduction to cross play, you can play with your friends from any console. Overall, this doesn't feel like OW, but it's a great FPS MOBA overall."

19764,"i would recommend this.  I like it sort of in a way, tho this is my nitpicks with it, wehere the maps are a bit smaller, and stuff. but this seems about right with 5v5 player matches.  i dont nknow much tho about it yet so far to really say much more.  i think its a little bit bland with the small maps, and one thing Id say is not that great is how you will playthe same map for 3 rounds or so in a row and never move to a next section.  just the same map every time.  but for the 5v5 game players it is, its ok.  havent played it enough to know if i like it.  i kind of get a bit bored with it some, but idk i come back.  i give it a 4/5 or maybe 3.5/5 maybe like 3.8-9/5 so far"
19765,"Already came out of beta, but still got more glitches than Goat Simulator."
19766,"I bought the year long battle pass, because i wanted a year of battle passes, they gave me the furia skin that came with it as well as all the champions for the year but they've been hosting ""Events"" since i bought it and they require a ""event pass"" and any producer that is willing to pull that bullshit is scum of the earth. go ahead and play the game, but if you spend money on it they are gonna fuck you over by giving you a bunch of shit you didn't ask for instead of what you bought"

Makes for a game that strips away the fluff of previous titles (ammo boxes, health pick ups) and focuses only on the fun (unique character designs, rewarding teamplay). Was worried that the heavy customization options available on a per-champion basis would detract from the ability to counter-play others, but all-in-all the system offers rich options for players to play each champ many different ways, and always the way they choose."

19843,nice game
19844,"Its fun and is better balanced than overwatch

19845,nice game i enjoyed it
19846,amzing game been playing since 2016 but the servers are horrible
19847,This game is great. Would recommend to everyone!
19848,"I'd like to recommend this game to people after 400 hours on steam and another 1000+ back when the game used it's own client to launch.

But I just cant.  The gameplay it self is good.  *When it works* which it often doesn't.

Over half a decade old and the game is still severely bogged down by bugs, some of them can be gamebreaking.  Particularly this game's habit of dropping matches and massive plethora of cheaters.  I could overlook this all and not bat an eyelash.

But where the game truly suffers is the community it self.  This is where the game suffers.  Sure you meet some nice people.  But those instances are quickly buried by the fact that Ranked and Casual lobbies are chalk full of toxic people constantly false reporting players, Afking, dropping matches via lagging the lobbies out and just general constant crying about non essential game mechanics. Screaming into mics and other nonsense of that nature.   And this is what truly leads to me not recommending the game.  And this is coming from somebody who's poured thousands of hours into GMOD

I want this game to succeed, I really do.  It has a much more unique feel than Overwatch does and allows more freedom of playstyles while still letting you maintain your roles.  But the playerbase is it's biggest issue.  The same issue that plagues DOTA 2 and League of Legends."
19849,"Great game, very helpful with my accuracy skills"
19850,get it

(Just wish they'd balance out skins a bit.)"
19859,"Its gay
"
19860,"""PLAYER DISCONNECTED""  
For no reason whatsoever game will log you out and perform login again mid match and it always happens mid match. No statement has come from the devs if this is a bug, if they are ever gonna fix it. It has been like this for the past 2 months and there has not even been an acknowledgement of any kind. Feels like the devs are just waiting for the game to die so they can move on."
19861,I like this game people actually pick support lmao
19862,"The game is fun, easy to learn and addicting.
Really sad, behavior is unpunished without limits. ATTENTION PARENTS!
No doubt a lot of content and a profitable game
Many simple polish things are ignored by developers who are VERY lazy.

In general, this game is fascinating both with its cosmetics and its execution. The lack of moderation / prosecution of the community for hooliganism, verbal abuse, racial abuse (hell in the game) - that's why the waiting time in rated PvP is 5-10 minutes, and as you approach death, it should increase.
Playing with others against bots, no matter how boring after many races, is a relaxed way of playing."
19863,very fun
19864,Very good game with a good sense of progression
19865,Game has a great variety of characters most of whom are viable. Easy to pick up and with a lot going on plus very doable as FTP. Really enjoying playing especially with a couple of mates to party up with across a variety of platforms.
19866,"It's a fun game with some cool aspects to it. But the card system used to be better when the game was in beta, and in my opinion Hi-Rez is adding too many champions in too little time. Also some old champs become somewhat unplayable in some circumstances when it comes too all the new ones. I recommend if you arent overwhelmed by constant updates and changes."
19867,"used to play this so much and had so much fun and now that i havent played it for 2 years and came back for a while, the crashes are still as frequent and the game has gotten worse
0/10 would not recommend"
19868,Fun game :)
19869,i liked it
19870,I found this to be a suitable cross between Smite and Overwatch.  It's a refreshing game that's literally quick-play nonstop.  T
19871,Its a fun game
19872,Very good game.
19873,"this game is so epic
movement good"
19874,"Sure, why not - play it! It's free and surprisingly fun. And, really, the only real good alternative to Overwatch. 

Still sometimes buggy and matchmaking can be horrible, especially if crossplay is set on. But all in all I wouldn't have spent over 200 hours in this game if it was garbage."
19875,"This game is like a Brawlhalla crossed with Overwatch. Even though I do not like roster rotations, this game still proves to be fun with how character abilities are utilized with skill sets."
19876,"great game really easy to get used to
"
19877,"best game ever

19883,"people call it a rip off of overwatch, but honestly, to each their own. been playing it for years now and recently came to PC. love the graphics upgrade. great game."
19884,"Overall luv the game, lots of champions to chose from, and each one has their own unique abilities. The rewards are good and it's not a pay to win game. Updates happen often and keep it interesting. Skins are awesome. 

problems:
Find that the game lag often not sure because i live in South Africa, the frame rate and ping goes of the charts some times."
19885,"cool game lol

19900,"What a time to review this game. Yes it's fun and yes it's very fun with friends too. What's not fun is the game breaking bugs and toxicity in the community. Thankfully they're rare and you can just mute them if they make too many noises. Also hirez, buff my boi raum pls."
19901,Easy to learn game. Some characters can be OP. But overall the micro-transactions are fair and if you wait long enough you can get enough crystals from the battle pass for free.

19976,Very pog.
19977,lol
19978,have 300+ hours on xbox. Best game of all time imo nut needs a bigger playerbase. its free. try it out
19979,Great game. I love it😍😍😍
19980,the game is very cool and funny but its very fustrating when you get promised you get 3.400 coins but you only get 100 coins out of it. thats also why i stopt playing it.
19981,A lot of people compare this to Overwatch. I like Paladins over the other game because of the upgrade/card system. You can play your people totally different than the last match you played as that character. With the upgrade system it's harder to cheese
19982,"Cons:
- Hitboxes are the actual size of mountains.
- Heroes are unbalanced.
- Maps are too small.
- Objectives get captured too fast.
- There is little to no counter play.
- Flanking is way too easy.
- Somehow they thought it was a good idea to have an item in the game to counter barriers, but not an item for the other types of tanks. Therefore removing barrier tanks from the actual meta.
- Skins are bad and overpriced.
- Constant bugs and animation breaking.
- Matchmaking is the worst I have ever seen.
- You either roll the enemy team for an easy win or get rolled. There is rarely ever a close game.

Pros:
- The card system is kinda cool.

 I would suggest only playing this game if you are broke and/or bad at shooters."
19983,nice game
19984,"fix the mf stutter, no, FIX THE GAME! 
Edit: NVM it was my DOG SH1T PC XD. The game is dope, Upgrade your engine to UE4 or even UE5. Like honestly hi-rez take some risks. I know you can. You released OB64 LMFAO."
19985,"Working on top of the strong and fairly balanced foundation of a free-to-play hero shooter, Paladins’ capacity for experimentation is its greatest strength. Even after over 100 hours of exhilarating battles and strategic planning, champions continue to find a way to offer new gameplay experiences. Whether it’s the main mode that encapsulates the teamwork aspect or the character designs that immediately flow with creativity, Paladins: Champions of the Realm clearly stands out in the midst of competition.

There are a few odd bugs and graphical problems that appear from time to time. Sometimes weapons like Makoa’s anchor or Torvald’s energy beam will stretch out across the entire map or a HUD overlay that should have disappeared will stay longer than needed. At one point the menu background disappeared and left behind a mess of inverted colours, but it was more of an annoyance than anything that affected gameplay.

As a free-to-play game, it’s always a concern that micro transactions could cause a feeling of unfairness, but Paladins keeps things on the level by not offering any competitive advantage for sale. Gold currency is earned by playing matches and completing quests, and using it to buy locked champions gives you a decent window of time to master a character as you save up for the next purchase. Of course, the entire selection of characters is available for purchase in a pack, and many cool outfits and other cosmetics can be purchased individually so you’re not left waiting for the item you want to drop from a loot box – though you can buy a loot box for a cheaper price if you don’t mind sifting through a handful of emotes and sprays. That’s fine, but it’s disappointing that some of the most impressive outfits can’t be purchased outright and are locked behind a chest. 

There’s nothing quite as satisfying as blasting the entire enemy team off the stage with Torvald’s hyper beam. Reanimating after you die as Terminus and vaporising any opponents too slow to get away never gets old, and seeing Willo’s multiplying seedling attack come your way inspires horror. But the greatest achievement is that Paladins: Champions of the Realm allows you to dictate your play style. Whether it's adding to the knock back of weapons or increasing the duration of your shield, Paladins empowers experimentation and true customisation. Amid the thrilling battles is a diverse five-on-five hero shooter that puts the power of choice front and center. Whether it’s the wonderfully imagined characters, the in-depth card and item customisation systems, or the inoffensive free-to-play model, there are plenty of options that make Paladins a worthy competitor for Overwatch."
19986,"First off free, second good performance, and third better than overwatch"
19987,Good Game
19988,"paul and da worm should not coexist 
"
19989,All the girls have big tits and asses. Perfect game
19990,"I feel like the game feels different than I last played it in 2017 a lot of changes to the game like a lot. There are some positives and negatives to the changes like the graphics, map changes. So the changes that I don't like are the Battle Pass and the removal of daily login rewards, oh and also kill replay and play of the game. I used to be an Androxus main I really loved the character now it's trash the ULT doesn't even feel like an ult I can only kill one player that's LOW HEALTH. Other than that the characters are broken and unbalanced, like unkillable tanks, very op basic attack like the whole team could die in just 20 seconds to the game a new player could dominate the game without any skills."
19991,free to play

20015,"[list]
[*]Game is fun, easy to learn, and a fun to play but sadly and grossly TOXIC community and environment (one of the worst in 30 years doing this)
[*]Toxic and horribly moderated and controlled community and people actually hacking this game which made us pee our pants. Sure go ahead... use a cheat.... for what?
[*]**The worst we have seen in 40 years doing this.
[*]Really sad, behavior is rampant without punishment. PARENTS BEWARE!
[*]Lots of content and a money making game no doubt. It is a GIANT ANAL BLEACHING PARTY!
[*]Many simple ""polishing"" area's ignored on the development side, which is VERY lazy as a clear hint at the direction the game is taking.
[*]Artwork and eye candy 80% of staff to keep sales going and the occasional server guru. Devs are gone, as no developer would be leave hours of hard work with so many issues.

[*]All in all this game is fun with cosmetics, and its execution. That is a credit to the idea and implementation.  The lack of moderating / holding the community accountable for bully, verbal abuse, racial insults (Hell in a game) is why Ranked PvP is 5-10min wait time and should be longer as it approaches dead.
[*]Playing with others vs Bots, however boring after many runs, is the relaxed way to play.

[h1]In closing, if you play Ranked or Unranked PvP, where there is a community of sorts... bring plenty of alcohol, mental health snacks, your choice of hallucinogen and a huge ability to ignore chat.. oh and play with a butt plug(no lube). Then you will feel at home and be able to tolerate the sad, racist, threatening, vile behaviors. One of the most disgusting in 30 years. [/h1]"

20037,"I've enjoyed this game in the time I have put into it. I could obviously pick out some things that I don't enjoy whether it be maybe some champion balances or the competitive rank/queue system and how it puts gold/plat with bronze people, but overall I'd recommend this game and I definitely see myself putting may more hours into it. Also, i'm addicted to cosmetics :)"

20050,.
20051,This game is worst than overwath but its ... free
20052,"fun, not toxic lul"
20053,Very unique game style and different from others. I recommend  Paladins for everyone.
20054,wtf is this

20056,"they give team fortress man very cool paladins, very cool"
20057,I recommend playing this game because it's basically a free version of overwatch and is way more fun than Valorant (Valorant really resembles Paladins)
20058,"decent fam
"
20059,very fun game lmao. a little rough around the edges but still fun
20060,"Legit though Paladins NAILS what Overwatch should have been when it comes to it being a MOBA FPS hybrid. Despite having no hero switching mid match the ways in which you can use heroes are much more versatile and a lot of team comps can work if you're paying attention to what your team can do to get the enemy on edge. Plus building your own loadout is fun, makes it feel like YOUR hero instead of a tool that's restricted to just countering one person. Again sorry for comparing OW to Paladins but I love that the game allows healers to at least hold their own against flankers if they're situationally aware, and tanks FEEL like tanks. 

Anywho on to the negatives, bugs are annoying, due to it being free to play the uuhh community is pretty frustrating. No killcam which sucks hard. REALLLY grindy ways to get even ONE skin and like the bounty store breaks every goddamn two weeks  etc. That and the game takes forever to start, and is really clunky when it comes to alt tabbing in and out of it and random crashes kinda blow. That's about it from me, Great game to play with friends, but please don't spend hours on end playing you'll just frustrate yourself."
20061,its an alright ow clone so if ur broke and cant get ow this is the way to go
20062,no
20063,I recomend this game to everyone
20064,"As a new player you will find a lot of things interesting as how to mechanics works and stuff in the game and with all the different types of characters u can play as, but once u spend around 200+ hours the game gets a little boring coz u know how everything works and the only thing that separates you from the enemy team is the skills of you and your teammates.

The game developers keep the game alive with plenty of bug fixes as well as introducing new characters to the game but its to one point and then that too will be boring to play with. It was a good game to play at the start with your friends and such but eventually it grows on you and you will get sick of how it is the same thing over and over again. 

Skins are a all Pay 2 Get, it is absolutely hard to earn any form of gems in the game as the devs rely on season pass to make money, so unless u will be active for that whole season, it is completely a waste of money to spend money on it to get that one specific skin that you want. Did i also mention that their servers can be really bad sometimes, mid game disconnections and such. Relogging into your game is alot more of a pain in the ass btw. 

The competitive scene of the game is toxic according to my experiences, they do not have room for mistakes, i constantly got nervous to even try to play a competitive game as i dont want to let anyone down haha. Could just be me  idk

Overall it is a good game for a new player, but it grows overtime for a veteran player.."

Multitude of character to choose from so you can find a champion that matches your play style, and unlike games like league of legends there aren't so many champions it feels like wading through a sea in order to find the one you like the most. is also the one PvP game where i'm not absolutely tilted and toxic 90% of the time i'm playing it. C'mon guys it's free, what do you have to lose besides the 10-30 minutes it takes to play a game?"
20099,good game for people who want a shooter but dont have any spare cash. Good grab in general. Give it a shot.

20102,"I've put over 4000 hours into this game and I can honestly say it's a waste of time.   Bugs galore and poor balancing alongside sloppy code that barely functions.  Ranked is a joke and matchmaking is hilarious.   The E-Sports scene is essentially non existent thanks to piss poor management by Hi-Rez studios. 

The game will be dead within a year.  

TL:DR  Game sucks ass and falling onto a pile of thumb tacks would be less painful.   

Fuck this game in the ass.

20141,"So, i like this game, and would very nearly recommend it. But it has some problems that will likely never be fixed, and this irks me as loyal player.

First, the battle passes. There's been good ones, but almost every battle pass since the pirate one more than a year ago now has been awful terrible garbage with arguably 1 good skin at best, with the current pass having not even a single good skin.

Second, the modes. This game used to have 3 modes, now it has 1.5. It has siege, the primary mode, then there's Onslaught/king of the hill(Which are merged queues. This is the .5 in my last sentence, king of the hill is so bad of a mode it makes onslaught worse by proxy), and finally, there's team death match. TDM in this game is so bad and so disliked by the community that i strongly wonder why the devs haven't removed or replaced it yet. Back in the day, there used to be pure payload(which TDM replaced) which was AMAZING. It had some of the strongest map design across all maps, and encouraged objective play, which is where hero shooters shine. Also, king of the hill wasn't there, so onslaught got it's other .5 back.

Third, the bugs. I know the devs are working on this hard now, but this game has been mired in a lagoon of bugs and spaghetti code from day 1. The part that i don't think will ever be fixed is that they are okay with just cutting errant pieces they consider buggy rather than trying to fix them, like third person view."

20152,"Game is good but the meta is repetitive and boring. The few characters who are skill dependent still struggle against the rest of the cast at higher MMR. 

Really fun at low ranks to mess around with friends since no one knows what to do but if you want to grind to the top just know every game becomes ""who chose the meta team?"" 

I'd still recommend because the game IS an enjoyable experience; The issue is the greater your MMR, the more toxicity you'll encounter and the less enjoyable the game becomes. 

If you are going to spend money on the game, get the battlepass before anything else because the gold from it can buy you a good amount of characters."

20193,"i wish i could say that i recommend this game but it seems that the devs hate this game themselves. i WANT to recommend this game, i WANT others to play it cuz the playerbase is rapidly dying and no fugckin crossovers will fix this. 

the devs hate themselves for making this game and they're making it our fault.

every update adds around 14 million bugs, 14 million bugs that they will most likely never fix and just adds on the gold coloured shid that is this game.

this game has a lot of creativity, interesting cool champions, pretty map designs and cool ideas but all that good stuff goes to shid if the game wont even load properly,
if the bounty store wont even work, if the games loads infinitely, the game crashes about 44 times every 3 matches. 

This game has so much potential and since i have been playing its potential has just been rapidly declining, with devs removing features that i/we loved about this game. 

its sad really, seeing it bleed out like this. but i have my hopes, i will play this godforsaken game till i have sucked every last drop of blood en semen out of this game.
I will always hope that the devs stop making this a money grabbing scam but actually a game that is fun to play and actually is recommendable.

Anyways its free, you should try it out, its fun"
20194,nice
20195,"i would recomend this game because it has a very enticing new player experience but sadly this game is ridled with minor and major bugs that can effect the the new player experiance and the veterens of this game feel a lot of preasure as they dont want to see their favourite game die but happly the developers have started to listen to the comunity and i can finaly start being proud of a paladins player
"
20196,"this game is a lot of fun, my son showed it to me and I already have my daughter and husband now playing. So we battle as a team"
20197,very fun pogger wow yes ebic
20198,"Doesn't have anything that sets it apart from anything else, many of the characters are uninspired. 

Most are extremely similar or straight up just the same as other games in the same genre. The few characters and spells that were somewhat unique didnt really do it for me either, I never played a character that i really liked or felt interested in. 

The entire game has a huge copy paste vibe, offering very little to change the game. Only upside to this is if you have played similar games its very easy to pick up. 

everything is really okay at best, theres nothing it really does very well. Gun play is okay, spells are okay etc. There are just other similar titles that have more to offer and feel better to play.

balancing is atrocious, power creep is very real. combine that with having to pay for heroes it can easily ruin your fun if youre a f2p player.

And since its f2p you will have to pay money to buy heroes or grind them out in a competitive multiplayer game, I know many people dont care but personally I can not stand it.

If it was not free to play i would say dont bother, unless you just really love the genre and are burned out on similar titles."

20204,Great game flexible with all playstyles and i love the characters i would try it if i were any of you
20205,"I played this game heavily during quarantine with some friends of mine and it was the most fun I've had in a hero based FPS/OBJ game. I love the insane amount of characters you can choose from, and making specific builds for each of them. 

They have both competitive and casual play, I don't usually do competitive unless it's required for the challenges, I'm more of a laid back person, which is why my friends and I would do bots or quick play instead (but we still like to try our best to win). 

Communication and using combos between players with abilities or ultimates is definitely a must for big pushes or to gain the lead. (Although as a Tank main, using Ash or Inara, I end up messing things up because the enemy gets booped away or walled off.. aha..). 

It's free to play, you just need to buy the champion pack and season pass, which is great because you support the game devs! They deserve it! 

Another thing I love about the game is the stylized art look they went for, in love with it! 

Give it a try 
"
20206,"PROS :

-Overwatch BUT free.
-Few hacker GREAT anti-cheat
-Fast Matchmaking
-Lots of fun
-No bugs at all 
-A lot of great champions that you can chose from
-Thicc Champions

CONS :

-Couldnt find my dad
-Champions need to be unlocked with in-game points a (18k points for each, can take from one hour to a week to make those points)
-Too Many Micro Transactions
-You rarely find ppl with mics in this game
-Kid community (still better than fortnite tho)

OVERALL OPINION 
--Tbh a great free game to kill some time in. LOTS AND LOTS OF FUN XD

20207,soooo gooood
20208,very epik game mane!!!
20209,Fuck the matchmaking and I'll play this game tomorrow.
20210,"Shitty free to play overwatch, not even a good waste of time"
20211,"Having played this game for over two years now.
I can say that Paladins is not an Overwatch clone. What separates Paladins from Overwatch is it's unique card system.
The card system is used to alternate different builds on your champions that can consist of either increasing your health pool,increasing your reload speed, or reducing your ability cooldowns to name a few. This can make for 100s of hrs of play time trying different builds and playstyles on 47 champions each with unique passives and abilities. The downside however to this system, Is that it can result in having broken builds that can be part of the 'Meta'. Which tagged with powerful champions make a powerful composition { Meta comp for short}. The game has an impressive 29 maps in its roster. 14 siege maps, 8 onslaught maps, and 7 team deathmatch maps. The only flaw too this though is that Evil Mojo is a small dev team vs. 29 maps that have certain exploits {or 90% of the time you getting stuck on walls} on top of trying to keep balance over 47 champions. Now the game has 4 main game modes that I'll describe in a short description Siege {lose 1 round and your teammate afks the rest of the match}, Team Deathmatch {Warming up just so that you can get your butt handed to you in siege mode}, Onslaught {10 min queue time}, and Ranked mode {xxxplayerxxx has not made a selection enjoy another 15 min queue time lols}. In short when you start playing this game expect to carry your teammates cuz they wont carry you. Or else you get blamed for the loss. But there are reasons to play this game. For one, if both of your teams are evenly skilled it can lead to some really fun and intense matches that even on a win or loss you still feel like you got a dopamine rush out of it. And playing with trolls decks can be a blast with friends.{recommended for siege mode not ranked just don't blame me if your team spam reports your account to no end and be dmed privately for about 20 mins}. The bugs in this game are so immense it's a surprise that the game servers are still functioning. Although little by little they do fix some of the bugs eventually while others are there permamently due to ""spaghetti code they cant mess with or else it breaks the game even more"". Despite all these problems I do believe this game has a chance to make a better name for itself. And has long has you treat this has a more casual experience. You will ensure you'll have more fun with the game. Anyway, I'll head outta here now. If you read this all the way through thank you for taking your time to do so. Catch ya later"

20279,"A garbage game with derivative concepts and terrible pacing. For some reason, the developers think that being on the receiving end of a blind 100-to-0 insta-pop is good game design and repeated it for several of their blatantly pay-to-win heroes. You either stomp or get stomped. There's no in between. Also, the whole thing is actually based not around gameplay, but about trying to trick you into buying cash shop currency. Even for a free to play game, the community is remarkably antagonistic and loathe to work together. It makes me afraid no small portion of it is here only because they've been banned from the pay to play titles this one is a rip off of."

20315,"Moved over from Overwatch to Paladins due to drought of content and let me tell you, i have never enjoyed a game as soon as I first played it like this one. If you have played Overwatch, TF2, or any teambased objective capturing type of game. I STRONGLY recomend this game to you. It has a huge variety of champions to choose from with load outs that you can customize and fit to your liking. It also has a decent amount of content! (Unlike Overwatch) I started this game 6 or 5 weeks ago and its already one of my favorites. if someone tells you ""Paladins is utter garbage!!"" they are super wrong or haven't tried it. Once again I love this game and I hope you will see this and be inspired to try and hopefully grow the Paladins community! <3"
20316,yes
20317,So many ways to play so many unique characters and no monetization to get in the way of gameplay. A prime example of how all free-to-play games should function.

Koga has righclick and he becomes invincible then he proceeds to put his fat 75"" cock in your ass. Just when you think it couldn't get anyworse comes Maeve.

20390,"This game was great at one point, about two years ago when getting gold did not take weeks to be able to buy champions. I have been playing this game since beta on ps4 and recently swapped to pc. Not only do they not allow you to transfer your account, the pack to get all past future and present champions is no longer available. Hi-Rez has prioritized money over the quality of the game, they force you into a situation where if you don't spend weeks grinding you can't buy a few characters and made them purchasable by gems. The saddest part about the fact that they have made the game so micro-transaction there has still not been any significant performance change. The game still runs like ass but they want you to spend 20 plus dollars on a few characters. The core fun aspects of the game have been tainted by the fact that you can only play a handful of characters before you have to open up your wallet. Until I can transfer my data from ps4, and the characters don't take weeks to get then I don't think I will ever play this game again. For example the characters cost 60,000 coins, and you make around 100 average a game if you win, 200 sometimes if your lucky. That is 600 to 300  matches to acquire one character, that is truly abhorrent. They have killed this once great game, and I truly believe that this game is no longer worth the time. Fix this game so people can actually play without drying out their wallets, fix the micro-transactions and then this game can start on the path to be good again."

20408,"Very buggy, but fun"
20409,"the game used to be good but since 2018 with the game breaking bugs, chaos of a matchmaking in ranked (example: i was in Gold II but my opponents are always Diamonds and Plats while my teammates are Bronze and Silvers like wtf?), unbalanced roster, and most of all the uncaring developers. why bother spend money for every battlepass? the amount of money the players spent for the battle pass is literally more than enough to buy Overwatch. Overwatch right now is in it's best shape since 2017, the roster is balanced, little bugs, matchmaking in Comp is nice and the best one is that Blizzard cares for it very much, they listen to the player's feedback, they always try their best with balancing now and try to not make power creeps like before, although the anti cheat system is a bit crap. Meanwhile Hi-Rez is using Paladins as a cash grab game. They never cared for the game, they never fix any game breaking bugs, their balancing is absolute garbage, they only focuses on making cosmetics and female champions for looks, and worst of all is that the players still sucks the Devs's dicks and won't stop! I mean being loyal is fine, but the Developers are literally sucking the money out of the players like mosquitos sucks blood from humans. i- i- i just can't. I quit back in 2018 but came back and nothing changed. the way Hi-Rez fixes the game is the same as putting a band-aid on a broken arm and they still get money from the players. just buy Overwatch, like seriously just do it."
20410,big boy dum
20411,It was a great game until they got rid of 3rd person view and ruined the game now it sucks
20412,rer
20413,"this game is insane
"
20414,"Better version of Overwatch and it is free,"
20415,it resets my progress and removed any sorts of benefit for buying the founder pack. not recommended even as a nostalgia game.
20416,"If you enjoy hero-shooters in the vein of TF2 and Overwatch, you'll immediately enjoy Paladins! If you haven't or are on the fence about this style of team-oriented hero-based FPS, you should still give it a try because its FREE! What's not to like about that??

While this is a bold statement, I make it on purpose and with full confidence: [b]Paladins is a better game than Overwatch![/b] Here are a few reasons why:

[b][u]Hero Diversity:[/u][/b]
With 50 heroes (or champions) to choose from there's a very good chance you'll end up really enjoying at least a dozen of them. While some are your typical archetypes like ""Old man with an AR"" or ""Little person inside a mech suit"", there is a large amount that are unique to Paladins and make the game really fun!

[b][u]Actual Character Builds:[/u][/b]
Unlike Overwatch, there is a 2-part system in Paladins that allows you to tweak how you play your champion. Talents and Loadouts can majorly change how a support plays, possibly turning them into a DPS hybrid, or making a Tank champion into an off-support, etc. In the beginning of a match you get to pick a Talent and a Loadout for your champion. Talents work as a large playstyle change while Loadouts act more as small changes further honing in on that exact way you want to play. You can create your own custom Loadouts for a champion via a neat card deck system.

[b][u]In-Match Items:[/u][/b]
To offset the fact that you're locked into a champion the whole match once you choose (choices have weight, a plus in my book!), you can buy items while in spawn that can further affect your playstyle. These temporary items can be bought with credits that are awarded for doing things in a match. Getting kills/eliminations, playing the objective, performing role-based tasks like healing, absorbing damage, etc, are all methods to earn them. The items vary in scope from things like life steal, resistance to crowd control, faster movement speed, ability to see cloaked/invisible enemies and everything in between.

Here are a few more pluses that I enjoy about Paladins:

CROSSPLAY
Dedicated servers
Anti-cheat
Ways to earn skins/cosmetics for free
Fair and rewarding seasonal battle pass
Regular updates and balance changes
Bot/Practice matches, Casuals, Ranked modes
Firing/Practice Range

Hopefully something I said above has piqued your interest because you'll quickly discover there's a  surprisingly deep game to be had in Paladins. It's criminally underrated! I know I've been nothing but positive so far, so let me share just a few cons from my personal experience.  I've had random crashes and bugs that can be as harmless as a visual glitch or serious like an ability just plain not working at all.

Playing solo is totally fine, but this game, as with many, is MUCH MUCH more fun with friends, so grab a buddy (or 4) and head on into Paladins and see if you end up enjoying this game as much as I have come to in my 100+ hours so far. I look forward to my next 100 and hopefully beyond!"
20417,this game is great
20418,"This game is almost perfect to me. 10/10 music, 10/10 art, 10/10 gameplay and a good story even though I didn't understand much of it at first. Even though characters for the most part only make short appearances, all of them feel really unique. (And the ones that do make several appearances are really lovable)
At the start of the game, there's a chance you might not be super intrigued by it but I'm 90% sure that you'll love it by the end of the game. Not to mention the game pretty much never ends-
There's so many areas to do and so many side quests/objectives that you'll almost never run out of value. My favorite game of all time. 10/10 experience. Huge thanks to my friend for letting me enjoy this great game.:hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts: this game is so :hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts: good its unbelievable. best story ive ever played through jesus :hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts: christ this game is 100% worth the price please buy and finish it please i beg:hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts: this game is so :hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts: good its unbelievable. best story ive ever played through jesus :hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts::hearts: christ this game is 100% worth the price please buy and finish it please i beg"

20425,Paladins>Overwatch
20426,"I didn't want to write this, in first place but I just feel like it needs to be heard. There's a lot of positive feedback for Paladins on Steam. But they are from people who have like 2-50 hours in the game and let me tell you, it's not enough to get a basic understanding of this game. 
Starting with something not really important, there are many visual bugs that are with us since the beta. There are even new ones, so I'll give you some quick examples. You often get blank messages from the game that you can't close. You can not see the avatars in the queue. Some legendary cards are bugged and you can not see them without moving the mouse. But do not fear, some have been fixed. After 2 years. I understand that visual bugs are not that game breaking, but they are still disgusting for me and can be to some new players.
Next up, we have new/reworked maps. They are really beautiful but the main problem is optimization. While on an old maps you can have around 100fps on baazar you get 20-40fps. After this, there come hitboxes. The best example of this is Frozen Guards, where the hitboxes are bigger than the textures and you often get stuck on them, dying for no reason. Also, there are places where you can hit but not get hitted, or you can stay under the map for the whole round. Skyboxes are non-existent and some textures are too short, making them just unpleasant to look at. New timber mill is no better than this one. You can also kill yourself on spawn too.
Time for something serious. Matchmaking. The worst thing in this whole game. Mostly when you join the casual queue, you pretty much do not care about ranks or levels on the opposing team, and I can totally understand that. But when you start playing ranked games, you often see unbalanced teams. As a master player, I can tell you that season 3 was the worst I have seen. Masters/diamonds playing with golds/platinums in the lobby. It was very stressful for both sides. Masters were mad at the low elo players and the golds were stressed because they just didn't know what to do yet. They should have been studying the game at their level and not being carried by better players. But season 4 got me. Evil Mojo announced bigger reset for the new season and guess what. Ex masters/diamonds with 2-3, sometimes even 0-5, qualifiers got diamonds. That's not what the reset was supposed to be about and it's so wrong in every way. Most master/diamond players are boosted, throwing other matches and making game experience horrible. They are not banned from the game or matched up with weaker players.
The game servers are no joke - lags are everywhere. And they can even say that's your fault. I have a ping of over 15 in every single game, yet Paladins is the only one where I have lags with a ping like that. I get kicked out of matches more often than I get into them. Sometimes the game even crashes on its own or I get disconnected in the middle of a match for no reason. Even delay is back. It's like you need a computer from NASA, to play it, even on low graphics.
And that's where we go to Paladins dead-sport. Evil Mojo has informed us that there will be no e-sport for Paladins in 2021. The devs are killing their own child with this. Without a competitive scene, most long-term players will just move to new games where they can actually achieve something and use their skills. And without it, there will most likely be no streamers and no new viewers interested in the game to try it out for themselves. Casual players can not make this game come alive. They have nothing to make them stick around longer, as the pro players they favour will just disappear. They will get bored and move on to something new.
And as for casual players, parties are also bugged so you have to restart the game to invite someone again. And even if you get in queue, there is a high chance that only one of u will get into the lobby and the other one will get desertered.
Also, Evil Mojo does not care about hackers or drop hackers. The game has no valid way to prevent cheating, and the developers do not try to ban them. Even after emails or tickets, most players are free to roam around the game.
As for balance, it's not perfect and the devs clearly do not understand their game and way they should operate with legendaries, cards, and cooldowns. They nerf things that are perfectly fine the way they are, but leave overpowered things untouched.
To make everything clear, this game gets worse every year. But thanks to it, I have met amazing people and made some pretty good friends. Over time, I feel like I need to move on from it. It stresses me out too often and I can not watch devs destroy my good memories. I definitely do not recommend playing it, alone or with friends. Try other games instead.

20433,"This game has more bugs and crashes than good gameplay. For anyone who wants to start playing Paladins, just don't do it."
20434,Really fun to play with friends! Just wish Hi-Rez poured more resources into Evil Mojo so they can fully tap into their ideas for the game.
20435,"Hi. An old paladins' player here and I want to type few words to people who think about starting adventure in this game.
DON'T DO THAT.
Game is outdated. Customs and training room lacks features (in custom game you can practically play only 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2 etc.)
Game also has really small player base. In ranked (in casual too) you can be queued with top100 gms or masters while being new player. In higher ranks you will play with practically the same people all the time.
Players are often toxic (leaving, huge ego, in ranked mode troll picks).
Servers has less than 30 tickrate and are hardly secured, a lot of matches ends with player drophacking.
Game is also very bugged, you can get a crash for no reason, you can end up in infinity loop after getting a new skin. And it's only beginning of list...
Hi-rez also resigned from e-sport scene, which is a bad signal for a game.
Respect yourself  and your time guys. Don't play that game."
20436,A good shooter alternative to overwatch. It is balanced pretty evenly and has great mechanics. Some complain about bugs but I personally never had a problem. The dev team is very active and works with the community.
20437,"Went in wanting a break from overwatch, and I think it's replacing it for me. I get games within 2 minutes which you DO NOT get in overwatch, and playing Healers is actually fun. Prices seem really steep for everything, but I guess that's the cost of F2P games.

I dislike the starting characters though, and feel like you should get at least 3 for each role or maybe get to make a few choices."
20438,GOOD GAME
20439,Overall a fun game. The card/talent system lets you customize champions to your favorite play style. It is the main reason I keep coming back.
20440,Game keep Crashing
20441,great
20442,"This game has gone downhill over the years. I have never complained until the recent update. The complaints have to do with their recent worm player update. Complaining about such ended in their mods muting me in discord. It's really sad how badly this game has gone. Say goodbye to your healers.
EDIT: It's so bad, they've disabled comments on this review! Look for a different game!"
20443,"Hi I'm not a new player , I was playing Paladins with my ps4 about 4 years ago . 
Game Systems are nice Graphics are nice too , Character designs are insane , Voice actors are good too but something really bothers me . There are some champions such as Skye , Koga , Maeve , Victor and any champion who just Spray And Pray for kills without fair balance . For example Skye ; Skye is an OP champion but why ? Cuz she is lethal in close range , She Spray you (Single Shot players like me who use io would understand) , Fast movement speed (Thats fair cuz she's and assassin anyways) but the smoke bomb every time she kills some-one she uses smoke bomb and no-one can really track her (except io cuz of Luna) She is very OP in many ways . I always tried to counter her with Luna (The blue Celestial Fox who tracks enemies nearby) but she always killed Luna in a Second !
Now Maeve (I was a Maeve User back there but i didn't want unfair advantages) Maeve is less OPer but still an OP , First cuz she's very fast , Second cuz of movement speed you really can't defeat her with single shot champions (Such as Casie , io and other single shot champions) Every time i try to counter her she just kill me real quick . Her Skills are a bit fair cuz you still can see her (If we unseen her Ult) 
Viktor (ik Viktor is a Default Champion) Viktor reload speed is very fast and can Spray you and then Sprint and regain health then Spray you again , (His attack damage is a bit low but his magazine size is 30 anyways) 
Koga is the easiest one among these champions who spray cuz he doesn't have these kind of OP abilities .
Some champions are ""Over Used !"" Like Viktor , Koga , Maeve , Skye , Lex , Androxus , Barik , Kinessa , Ruckus , Evie , Willo , Casie , Tyra , Raume and Imani and the others are just like they don't really exist in game .
And now the matchmaking system , 
This unfair that sometimes enemy team is really Strong and yours are some newbies starting the game , at least try to improve the matchmaking system such as KD ratio , If a group of 10 players in a server with the same or a bit higher or lower KD ratio play with each other , I promise non of these Problems could really happen .
Ty For your time and please read this comment !"

20454,"Free to play first person with a vast variety of champions to play, each with their own and unique play style. Very rewarding grinding for coins to unlock new characters, But has a few share of bugs and with the removal of the top play feature. The rewarding factor of getting top played is now gone."

20460,"Hi there, i am a sea player having close to 1.5k hours gameplay on paladins. I will be focusing more on the bad side  / the unfun side of this game instead of going for the positive ones, and believe me, this game is hella fun and is a must play in the genre of free to play steam games. There are 47 champions in this game as of 01/21. And balancing every champion is really hard.  So there might be a unbalanced champ everytime one major update goes off. But we can ban that particular champ while we are going for ranked match. This game has potential, really fun to play with friends and runs easily on most of the low end gpus. The match making sometimes can make you question urself why did you even install this game. The MM is horrible sometimes. So you wont be having a pleasant game every game even if you are a grandmaster. The amount of hackers arent that bad. I haven't encountered myself one for a couple of days. Ratio of getting a hacker is probably like 20:1 for me. Note that im playing on sea server, i dont know what's going on in the other servers. The server lags are the worst thing to happen, the game will not be playable at all, even tho the ping is fine. But the game is constantly getting updates and fixes. The game is getting better and better. To end the summary, you wont be getting bored anytime soon because of the amount of champions and amount of talents and the amount of styles you can play with a particular champ."
20461,Fun
20462,nice

20466,"If you have a low end system, this will be a good game to play. This game is free and easy to get skins and stuff without spending too much money. You could get a battle pass just from grinding 1 and a half battle passes. And sometimes, they added some challenge that gives you free crystals. Recently, they just added bounty store that sell skins just from completing daily challenges without using any crystals. You could join the games community like discord, to get all the information you need about the game."

20478,Pls nerf the fucking new champ disgusting

20480,"Game is okay, but if you got $20... just buy overwatch mang. Way better

7/10, im being generous because i used to love this game, then i got overwatch and stopped playing paladins."
20481,"I used to love Paladins because of its option for third person view. This option has since been removed in a patch, which ruined my enjoyment of the game. I much prefer third person shooters to first person shooters, and for this reason I can not recommend Paladins anymore."

The champions are so fun to play, my favorites are Drogoz, and Bomb king. Drogoz hovers around with a jet pack because he was born without wings unlike his dragon family :(. But his jet pack is dope and he has a friggin rocket launcher to accompany it. super fun to play. Bomb King lobs bombs at people and explodes them at the same time, able to kill people in single well planned attacks. Besidesthese characters there are at least 35 others, which is crazy for an ability based shooter!! yup lov it"

20529,"While compared to Overwatch many times in the past, there has been a wide divergence from the game it was once in beta and the game it came out to be now. 
A strategic hero-shooter updated frequently with new champions (over 50 at the time of this review), each with select sets of abilities that are easy to understand and fun to master. The gameplay is quick, yet methodical as the time to kill for each champion varies, but this allows for a chance to react to getting shot at most of the time.
While cover certainly helps, you won't find yourself stuck under it the whole game as it plays a lot like a run and gun. As stated before, there are over 50 champions to unlock, with a select amount on rotation at a given time and some given at the start. The champions pack is available to purchase for a limited time, so if you're interested in the whole game experience then I would pick it up ASAP.
With customization options ranging from loadouts to change the nuances of the abilities, to highly detailed skins with custom voice actors, there is a lot of freedom of expression to be found in this game that is not found in others.
If you are still wondering if this is a game worth sinking time (and/or money into), just look at my hours. This is a fun one for sure."

20539,soo good
20540,"I would say its better than Overwatch, plus its free and not as toxic."
20541,This game was great until i got a pc that could run Overwatch.
20542,"//As for someone who ones both this and paid paladins, I have clocked more hours and came back more to this game than that dusty game sitting in my hard drive could ever dream. Though the fantasy angle with the game as well as the rough edges the game has with it's bug could be a hard pill to swallow down to it, it's a fun a game to enjoy. As well Evil Mojo having got it's act together with it's communication with the community of this game since recent years. //

With baffling new changes and questionable newer champions pretty much leaving old champions, I can't really recommend this game anymore. The people working on this game really need to reevaluate now or else this game is gonna start bleeding players."
20543,it is pretty fun if you figure out the champions
20544,its a fun free to play game that is a good starter game for learning mouse and key

We put up with all that crap. It's good."

20561,where is my team
20562,Very good game! I enjoy it a lot. Only thing missing is role-que.
20563,its super like overwatch maybe even better
20564,no
20565,"It looks a lot like an Overwatch rip off, and largely it is, but if you can look past the very obvious ""inspiration"" it takes from Overwatch, it has a very unique blend of first person shooter and League of Legends build crafting in an arena setting. The loadouts system is genuinely really well thought out and the mechanics of gameplay are much tighter than you would expect from a rip-off game. I have around 200 hours in Overwatch, and I might even like Paladins more."
20566,"I do really recommend it, for a ""Casual"" player that just play games for fun (How it suppose to be) its really a good game, even tho you might see a lot of thing from other games, what game right now doesnt have things from other games?

20590,help i cant play anything slow paced now
20591,"This game is inferior to overwatch in pretty much every single way, i cannot think of a single thing this game does better than overwatch. The game can be fun but it depends on if you get the team with all the players who only play this game on your team, because more likely than not, you will be placed on a team of all new players against players with character mastery 15+ all on the enemy team. They seem to have gone the smite route with the matchmaking and just throwing all the new players against the players who exclusively play this game. Though who can blame them, they aren't getting many new players, just drip feeding recurring players just like smite. Do yourself a favor and just buy overwatch instead of playing this sad clone."
20592,Play and have fun that's all
20593,better than overwatch tbh

No longer balanced, and buggy. half the time when pushing in Siege, one or two players will be on the point and the game will still end the overtime push saying no players are on the point. again in its prime i put hundreds of hours in this game and plenty of gems for skins. with multiple changes and updates the game became unbalanced and inconsistent match making."

20651,"Bugsnax is a light-lifting puzzle adventure that is elevated by its strong story and characters that I enjoyed until the very end. Despite some simple mechanics, the laughs outnumbered the groans significantly as I found myself surprisingly invested in the events of the island and its inhabitants. With over 100 Bugsnax to discover and catch there’s plenty here to entertain the completionists, alongside those just looking for a well-told six-hour mystery that will keep you guessing until after the credits roll. All of this while making you feel emotionally connected to the characters, something you previously might have thought sounded impossible. Until you saw a carrot crawl, that is."

20717,"I recommed this game, it's very fun and pretty well-balanced so to speak. However, if it keeps having the p2w format it's going to right now. The game won't live for long. And there should be more updates focusing on actual issues, and not minor bugs and glitches."
20718,"play this if you can't afford Overwatch.
Otherwise Don't!"
20719,e bun
20720,The game would be great if not for a bug that freezes you in some matches. You cant move or shoot till its fixed I would stay clear of the game.
20721,"You ever read the Hentai manga Emergence Metamorphosis? Yes the one by Shindo L. If you ever decide to play a ranked game in this; prepare to feel like the MC in that manga. Not only will you get spit roasted, picked on and raped so hard by both your teamates and the enemy team, but you'll also end up wanting to hit up drugs and booze just to try to forget the experience you had.

Anyway, the game is fun but some people are very toxic. I'm new and I tried playing a ranked game and all I got were people putting me off thinking I'm supposed to be a pro in this game. Why are there level 200's in a level 15 new player's ranked game anyway? 

If you want to enjoy the game, just play casuals but if you have a masochistic fetish, try ranked; You'll be spit roasted by high level people who do nothing but diss you for just being new to the game."
20722,Its a good knock off of overwatch and u can't go wrong with it its free!!!
20723,"good

20724,"Skill-wise, this feels like Overwatch-lite. It adds the additional element of basic level items, cards, and custom load-outs which add a nice variety to the game and allows you to tweak each hero to your play style."

20726,This game fucking sucks.
20727,"This game is quite great, It has a few bugs and I'm currently dealing with a crashing problem but beside that it's a great game!"
20728,A very good game despite the bugs that still exist now and weren't patch in beta
20729,"Originally I did think it was going to be a shit Overwatch clone but its actually a lot of fun. More chill and just all around feels better to play, much to my surprise."
20730,"for me after 4 hours playing this game it's fun but if you want to keep playing it's all about luck, there is no skill involved for 70% of the matches. You can frag and still lose because there is no way to get good teammates through matchmaking unless you are super lucky."
20731,"overwatch ripoff but still a very fun game despite its bugs
been playing it for 3 years now, does not disappoint"
20732,haha
20733,"Addictive yet for the wrong reasons. Matchmaking just isn't there. You want to keep playing but it's all about luck, there is no skill involved for 70% of the matches. You can frag and still lose because there is no way to get good teammates through matchmaking unless you are super lucky. Either carry or lose... if you're still playing, you're in a good spot I suppose but if you want to start playing, I'd advise against it."

20747,"Many people call Paladins ""Overwatch Clone"" or ""F2P Overwatch"". But I wouldn't call it like that. Paladins is a very good game and in my opinion much better than Overwatch. I really like the Gameplay and Graphic style. Well, there are some bugs and stuff, but they're not really annoying. The bad thing about this game and the reason I ""only"" gave Paladins 9 points is, that the Developers aka Hi-Rez Studios don't listen to the community. Unfortunately, Paladins is dying. Collapse"

20751,"Well as someone who has sunk a solid chunk of time into both Overwatch and Paladins, I feel i can safely say this game is no Overwatch clones as some might say.  Paladins is a fun game with frequent updates and is for certain worth the price of free. What it is not how ever is balanced or simple. I've never read the patch notes nor seen them for that matter so i have no way of knowing if any nerfs or buffs have ever occurred, but in the time ive played it certainly doesnt feel like it. It does feel like the devs just made some characters op and some not and pitched them against each other anyway. BUT this isn't always a bad thing because it can make for some interesting and sometimes satisfying moments in game I.e. using a weaker character and just wrecking someone who should've melted you. So in that way the game is unbalanced. Paladins is NOT simple due to character loadouts you have to create before game, this however is NOT a bad thing. It allows each player to create unique and individualized loadouts for EVERY character with 6 slots for SIX different loadouts for EACH character. This Overwatch does not have. Paladins also has items to purchase mid match to increase or decrease different things for your character i.e. ability cool downs, movement speed, and more. Overwatch DOES NOT have this and those things alone separate the two games to me.

My only real complaints about Paladins are some characters and some maps. Some characters are blatant rip offs of Overwatch characters Khan and Rein being the most obvious. A few characters have even been changed because of this. Next there are a few maps that are simply poorly designed. For example there is a winter map (i cant remember the name) that is god awfully long, if you have to push the point to the end of this map and die near the end point it takes so damn long to get to the other side you could lose if you only have a short amount of time left. Those are my biggest complaints about Paladins. New players may have complaints about having to unlock Champions but at the time of writing this there is a Champions pack to unlock all present and future Champions. I did this and I recommend that you do too.

On the subject of in game transactions Paladins has those as well, there are cosmetics ranging from emotes, character skins, mount skins, voice lines, and more that can be purchased or unlocked through loot boxes. Some loots boxes are holiday/season based and rotate through the year some cosmetics are limited and earned through events/challenges or through the battle pass(es). There are also skins based on character mastery.

All in all Paladins can be a very fun game and you cannot beat the price of free its also nothing like Overwatch so if the claims that it was a clone made you hesitant dont let it lead you astray this game only shares minor likeness with Overwatch and is worth playing. 8/10 because its not perfect."
20752,"F*** this game and the toxic relationship I have with it
It keeps making me depressed, but I keep coming back for more..."
20753,"Fairly easy to get a grasp of basics, and super fun pvp mode. Some glitches though, and game totally froze when I finished my first loadout making session."

Please... we don't need high refresh rate in the lobby
Sometimes we spawn without a horse and need to be shot at to be able to do anything.
it fails a lot at match making and doesn't keep the player in the queue it just stops searching if it fails ( at this patch at least)
changing the level of Gama in the display options will get reset after reach restart of the game.
Please add a choice for Auto Boost at champion selection, player with highest number of boosts automatically on choice.
If possible, instead of /r playername let us right click the player's names in the Tab Menu in game and reply to them.
Between the points while waiting for 50 seconds at spawn, please give us the choice  to make it shorter if everyone agrees to shortening the time, sometimes it's too much time to spend
and the typical community requests, please bring back the death cam... since it didn't fix anything, we don't like the customer death stickers idea it's too useful to be removed and it is pretty enjoyable."

20805,"Great, fun, fast-paced game"
20806,"Don't. Every Paladins player secretly hates it. Just don't.
Okay now that we have that aside, heres an actual review:
The game is very fun but also very toxic. I personally think it's only fun when playing with a friend. Alone the game isn't that great 'cause you just get shit-talked by every teammate. Of course you can just mute them but it still affects you/the person who gets shit-talked. For example when playing healer (coming from a support main) you get flamed for 'not healing enough' and it just affects the way you play. Some people might be able to ignore it but other people (myself included) feel bad and try to heal that person more but that results in the other teammates dying. Fact is: the community is trash. 
The game itsself is a joke. There's bugs everywhere and sometimes you literally just slide through the ground or walls which then results in death. Also hirez doesnt do anything about it. Many bugs get reported but they either make skins instead of fixing bugs or they answer with ""I'm sorry, but it's a wifi problem, not a game problem"" (This happened to many people, for example itsAdrix.)
Another big issue is the tutorial. Personally after first playing the tutorial I still didn't understand. 1. They only show you Viktor and they literally don't show you how to play different classes (Frontline, damage, flank, support) 2. It doesn't show a lot of things, just how to cap and push. I didn't know how to buy items for a long time because I didn't get what they're for. (This is just my personal opinion)
A problem that always accurs is the bad matchmaking. I mean, level 50 and 30 playing against 200 and 300+? That's a joke. Sometimes I can't even enjoy the game because I have level 100 people in my team and we are playing against level 500-900 players. Big yikes.
It's a great game for people who don't care what others think and who just play for fun. If you get affected by what others say or if you play to win then you shouldnt get it."
20807,"If you love games like overwatch but you stopped playing because it had gotten too competitive or just couldn't keep up with the meta then you will love this game, since it is the same kind of concept as overwatch however it isn't as competitive or that hard of a game to keep up with the meta, id also recommend this to those are interested in overwatch but didn't get into it for it's competitiveness."
20808,haha funney overwatch copey
20809,"I really was into this game some years ago and I'm having a great time playing it again. I actually have much more hours than the amount that steam says because I was used to play on the launcher, which could be found from the game's site and which had nothing to do with Steam. Then the launcher was deleted and the only way to play was with steam (now it's on Epic Games store too) and I couldn't have steam on my pc, so I stopped playing Paladins (also I had bought Overwatch). I'm happy to see that the game it's still being updated with new characters and events.
Now let's talk about the game. It's fun! The characters (even if some are very... let's say ""inspired"" by Overwatch characters) have all unique and memorable designs and voice lines and the maps are well designed and different from each other. The powers are fun to use and well balanced. The card system is very interesting and can really change the gameplay of a champion, letting players that have different styles of playing to make the champion more comfortable and easier to play. The item moba style system is very interesting too and, like in mobas, buying the right items is very important. 
When I started playing years ago I had bought the champions pack and I don't regret my decision at all, because having all the roster of characters just makes the experience more fun and less repetitive.
The major negative things that I don't like are the loot boxes (I'm always against them, even if it's only about cosmetics, as this game since it's not a pay to win) and the fact that you have to pay a lot of in-game currency (I don't remember how it's called, but let's say it's like the CoD points) to change the name.
Oh and thanks for the horses."

20833,"[h1]Tagging this review an overall negative one is extremely difficult to do, because I really love this game at its core.[/h1]

To get it out of the way, no. It's not a clone of you-know-what and I hate that I even have to mention that. There are similarities between any game and any other one. This one just happened to come out in a similar time frame as a AAA title of the same genre.
Paladins is a class-based FPS ""hero shooter"" that is influenced highly by MOBA style games. There's an in-game item shop, for example, where you can purchase upgrades throughout the match. Another feature that sets this game apart from most is the champion loadout creator, which can either make or break a champion and allows for customization ranging from specialized builds, to hybrids, to flat-out memes. These features make the gameplay interactive not only in a match, but in the menu between games where you can hone them to suit your needs. The game features a huge cast of playable characters (pushing 50 at the time of writing) and has everything from unbreakable tanks to high-octane glass cannons. There are unique aesthetics and themes featured in every character and map, with plenty of skins, emotes, and more depending on your taste. 

I've played this game since the beta in 2016, though, and it's had the same problems all this time. Firstly and perhaps most obviously, [b]bugs.[/b] The amount of glitches, crashes, and exploits that have been in the game since launch makes it feel like it never should have escaped beta. There have been multiple champions actually banned in competitive and ranked just because of how unpredictably buggy they are. The spaghetti code that the developers at Evil Mojo have inherited has only snowballed, and I don't entirely blame them for not being able to keep up.
Secondly, the community is extremely polarizing. There are some players who are only here to have fun and are truly pleasant to play with. Unfortunately, it usually only takes one negative person to spoil the whole attitude of the match with their ego. Once that happens, it contaminates the rest of the team and only perpetuates itself more. This can sometimes get to the point where people will actively throw or AFK in matches ([strike]including[/strike] - [i]specifically[/i] in ranked) or even wrongfully report other players out of spite. This whole situation makes the game fatiguing at times, even if you do your best to mute and ignore them. 
The last major problem is balance. There are characters that are picked in almost every match, even in casual, and others that are rarely seen. Of course, this is natural for any game, but the big problem here is that the top-tier champs tend to also be the most annoying to play against. Indestructible shields, permanent reveals, and nigh unavoidable burst damage, just to name a few. These can make the game really annoying to play. Another balance issue is the matchmaking. Ironically, the matchmaking in casual tends to be a bit better than ranked. ELO scores seem arbitrary and can often make it borderline impossible to climb ranks regardless of your performance. I personally had close to a 60% winrate in ranked near the end of Season 1, and was still losing twice as much rank for a loss as I was gaining for a win (still salty I didn't get Masters that season). 
There are other minor problems as well. The store can be money-hungry at times, there are content droughts now and then, and so on. But these are the major points.

However, with all the negative feedback this game receives, I still come back to it. Is it sunk cost? Can I not bear to abandon my waifus? I really don't think so. Again, at its core and while functioning as intended, Paladins is an amazing game. It has a very tight-knit cult following and a group of loving devs (although some might disagree with me on that one). I can tell this game has improved since I started playing, but it simply hasn't gotten to the point where I can recommend it yet. I'm critical of it because I love it and want to see it grow. If you're willing to push through the flaws for an experience that'll have you coming back for the highs, then by all means try it out. Otherwise, pass."

20848,¸ez game
20849,"I'm going to start off this review by saying Paladins is not a bad game, it is simply extremely flawed. (From a free to play player's perspective)

The game itself is fun to play with friends but is really testing at times. Why you ask? Allow me to elaborate. 

It is definitely NOT an Overwatch clone as most people claim however in the developers quest to make this game unique as possible they have spiralled the overall structure of the game out of control.

The matchmaking is really luck based as the game sometimes puts you with people who have no experience in the game, or put with people who have hundreds of hours and the best Champions. 

Now the Champions, to put it simply, this games meta revolves around the Champions, more than other similar games. This is not a positive. You could go into the game, grind up some coins, get the character you like but oh no the enemy team is running Maeve,Skye, Atlas, Khan and Io. Simple answer: you are fucked unless you have a similarly broken team comp on your end. Sure you can buy all characters and resolve this problem but keep in mind this is based off a free to play player's perspective. By doing this the developers have essentially given you a task, not to get your favourite character but essentially a good character who granted you may enjoy but that ruins the freedom of the game does it not? Say you get thrown into a match with 5 Skye mains, how will you go about it then?

In summary: in exchange for a higher skill requirement, the game has become completely unbalanced. 

The maps are quite horrendous too, they give so many options for the broken characters to wreak havoc. 

I know this game's target has been to be casual friendly however it honestly is the opposite of what it strived to be. You need to get wiped and thrown into the dumpster time and time again in order to truly get a grasp of how to play tactfully and how to counter said top tiers. 


This could all be solved by lots of balance patches towards all characters, revamping of the maps and removal of bugs. Also the game should NOT be free to play. This will remove your false sense of promise, I'm going to use Overwatch as an example. Overwatch is quite expensive however has a far more balanced and polished system. Paladins let's you play a base roster and a free rotation, these could be good but you're not going to get the same satisfaction as having access to all of them, by going through this process it eliminates your thought of purchasing the full game. 

""This ladies and gentlemen is what we call S T O N K S marketing!"" - a Paladins dev, maybe. 


This game has so much potential, however as I said at the start, it is extremely flawed.

I'm going to give it a 6/10 rating. 

(Steam really needs to add the option for a mixed review since my thoughts really aren't heavily negative or positive.)

Thx for reading my rant novel. Have a good day."
20850,very good
20851,Good

Characters are off-brand LoL champs and the game feels buggy compared to Overwatch but hey it's free :)"

20862,"This game is absolute trash from technical standpoint. Any time new update rolls out servers stop working, and everyone gets those weird errors. Every single time.

And leaving tech aside, Paladins is degrading in other aspects, too. More furry and lewd skins are getting released every update, and requests of players get ignored, because who cares about other players when horny neckbeards will pay you to get a new skin to fap to. Not even speaking about balancing. Look at patch notes, and then comments. You do the math."

20892,GREAT GAME
20893,it gud and fun
20894,"i love this game
"
20895,"Surprisingly fun team shooter game with roles like damage, healing, tank and sniper. Each character has unique moves they can do, with common control buttons between all characters in any role. I play this game weekly as a team with two friends on voice chat, and am really enjoying the replay value. 

The additional character skins you can unlock are also high quality, often with different voice packs and weapon effects. Some are just fun and silly, like the beach outfits with squirt guns instead of real ones, the monstery champions that turn into big plushies with a custom skin, the mermaid and merman skins, etc. 

If you don't usually play PvP games, this one might be a good one to start with because you get a team of four people to fight alongside you as well. Haven't run into any toxic players yet, the worst has been when teammates have no idea how to play their role (and all newbies don't know 'til they do!) 

Finally, it's free to play with whatever rotation of champions they have for free currently, so you can try it out before committing to buying a pack of champions. I was lucky enough to get the full champions pack as a gift, and it's pretty awesome. Dozens of characters and play styles to choose from. Recommended game. ♥"

20909,yeah
20910,the best free game
20911,Suddenly doubled the $$ price of unlocks while I was evaluating the purchase after just 4hrs of play. Thanks for the free app but you need to give warning about price changes. I was already on the fence about the base price - suddenly doubling it makes me instantly pass on it entirely.
20912,"played this game with my boyfriend and my brother , its a really fun relaxing game , also has a big selection and different play styles for different people"

20932,this game is so shit
20933,"Game overall is quite fun. HOT DOODOO GARBAGE BOTTOM TIER LOWEST OF THE LOW GAME FIXING THOUGH. Been playing for about 3 years now, every now and then just a couple of games, and even after all this times they just keep adding more and more content to the game before even fixing what's already there which makes it even worse at times. Every patch comes with fixes AND new dlc bugs you didn't ask for. But anyway, it's a good time killer, fun game and can be quite addictive with some very unique and interesting character designs. Very bad choice of game if you plan on going competitive though lol"
20934,"Great game. Needs more action pack maps.
"
20935,gayze into the abyss
20936,"Have about 500 hours in this game (I used the stand alone client), This game is a buggy mess with developers who care more about making hot cat girl skins then making the game playable. We haven't gotten a new map since July 17th, 2019. I am sick of this."

Because me and a lot of people lost their accounts because of some retarded 2 factor code, so you want me to remember my email from 2016? Yeah sure thing Evil Mojo, go f yourself.

20996,Please describe what you liked or disliked about this product and whether you recommend it to others. Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines. A description is required to post your recommendation.
20997,Bugadins.
20998,One of my favorite games. Has been for quite some time now! Check it out!
20999,"First thing I ought to say is that my hours are way off. I played this game a ton on the old launcher, especially during the Closed Beta. Now, with that out of the way:

This game is awful. If you're looking for a game that requires some semblance of skill, then you should look elsewhere. if you're looking for a fun, unique experience, you should also look elsewhere. They've stripped this game of most of it's unique, defining features (e.g. Old Siege and Mounting at any point)to bring you a bootleg Overwatch with what seems like slightly better balance (Though that is a very, very low bar). 

This game is fundamentally broken, and is too forgiving to players. Auto aim abilities should not exist, period. You should not be able to completely miss your shot with a sniper rifle and still have it counted. If you think that's an exaggeration, go try someone like Strix in training mode. You can completely miss by a fairly wide margin and still get credit for the shot. In addition, there should never be hard CC. Like Grover can completely shut down a flank member for about a second or two, and it's an instant death sentence. There is very little counterplay to it, unless you want to waste credits on CC resist or avoid trying to target Grover entirely.

The last thing to say, is that there is one reason to play this game in my estimation. And that is simply for the really, really silly builds you can make for some of the characters. Dodge roll Cassie where you leap like 15 ft or -90% gravity IO can be pretty entertaining. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that makes it worth playing though. If they brought back interesting mechanics like mounting at will, or what to me seemed like a huge selling point originally, the Original Siege game mode where you had to lay siege to a building to break down several barricades to get into the vault, then it might be worth playing again. But alas, I think that is that is gone for good and we are stuck with a low-skill, generic game for the rest of eternity."

21022,"First off, this game is a rip off of a bunch of different games. There is no resemblance of anything original here. Second, the game is dumbed down to such a high degree the game has no challenge whatsoever. And third, it preforms horribly, not in terms of framerate, but lag. Even with like 40 ping sometimes you just glitch and end up 20 feet in the opposite direction you were going, and sometimes you jump twice as high for seemingly no reason besides the ping. In short, this game is a piece of shit, don't waste your time."

It's definitely not as balanced as the rival hero shooters, but it is a good time, and each character feels very unique/out there compared to the competition."
21038,boobs
21039,"One of my favorite games that I have played, definitely recommend for those who enjoy FPS games, particularly those that seek to level their own skills as well as their characters!"
21040,"They dont have regional servers
And if someone leaves you get a bot and a loss
Could be a fun game but it seems Hi-rez just wants to put out shiny new skins instead of trying to get people to play"
21041,"THIS GAME IS SO FUCKING TRASH IT CRASHED TWICE IN 1 HOUR AND WHEN I BUY A CHAMPION I GET STUCK IN FAKAKING TIME LOOP. AHAAAAAAA. I CANT PLAY THE GAME BECAUSE OF ALL THE FUCKING CRASHES.

Overall I would say this is an excellent game, and even if it costed a lot of money I would buy it! *better than overwatch

great game also its worth it to buy the champs pack tbh"
21072,"Frankly, it's Overwatch but better, because you can customize your champion and radically alter your playstyle (some champs more so  than others.) Also, it's free to play, and acquiring new champs really isn't that hard. If you like Overwatch, it's hard to imagine you won't like this."
21073,this game i so fun an easy
21074,"I have a personal bond with this game since i started playing as a little kid. It was free, and honestly very bad functioning. Since, the games been getting better and a lot of fun to play. The amount of character customazation available, creates many opportunities to change how you play and i love it."
21075,"absolute garbage. balance your shit or people will keep leaving.

EDIT: Had enough of this game and just remove it from my acc. its the worst game i have ever played in my life. balance is nonexistent."
21076,"It's like Overwatch, but with customization.  You've got your set skills, but it's up to you how to make the champion your own.  There are also items, but only like 12/16 of them, not like League where there's probably 100+.

It's a great game to pick up and play for 20-40 minutes, then go about the rest of your day without having to sink 4 hours into it to learn the new meta every few months."

21095,"[h1] Paladins - 7.2 / 10 [/h1]


Paladins is a hero shooter, much in the likes of Overwatch, but with more pronounced MOBA elements. The cast of numerous characters is colorful and they all have their own personality, even though some of them come off as rushed or not very well thought out. The graphics are serviceable, which means they are not the best but not the worst either; they are colorful and get the job done, allowing the game to run on numerous machines, including the Nintendo Switch, which has become my favorite way to play the game, especially in portable mode.

What makes Paladins special is its unique Card system, which allows you to customize each and every hero with your personal play style. It’s rare that you’ll see two players using a certain hero the same way, and this makes the game less stale overtime than other similar offerings. Because of this, each and every game ends up playing differently, and this is exactly what I love about the game.

The in game economy is based on cosmetic only loot boxes, which means that despite being free to play and not counting individual skill, no player will ever be stronger than another.

The game receives updates, events and new heroes extremely frequently. Even though some bugs and glitches tend to stay longer than necessary at times, they rarely become game breaking or end up taking away from the enjoyment of the game.

Paladins is a free to play title that simply doesn’t feel like one, and this balance is very difficult to achieve nowadays. A well crafted card system, colorful heroes and good shooting mechanics make this game a joy to play, allowing it to stand out among the crowd of otherwise stale titles offered by much more renowned names in the industry."

The game receives updates, events and new heroes extremely frequently. Even though some bugs and glitches tend to stay longer than necessary at times, they rarely become game breaking or end up taking away from the enjoyment of the game.

Paladins is a free to play title that simply doesn’t feel like one, and this balance is very difficult to achieve nowadays. A well crafted card system, colorful heroes and good shooting mechanics make this game a joy to play, allowing it to stand out among the crowd of otherwise stale titles offered by much more renowned names in the industry."

21125,"I don't care what other people say, this game is way more addictive and more fun than Overwatch will every aspire to be. While there may be meta champs in this game, every champ is viable and easy to learn/play.

Really fun game and creative designs/customizations. 

Only gripe with this game is that some of the models are severely outdated and should get remastered as the game continues to develop."

21142,"I barely play it so idk tbh
it's pretty good"
21143,It is a great tf game. The Best Thing About This Game Is Talent And Card Deck Selections. It adds various options to choose from. Best part is trying different things to win.
21144,"The most toxic and unwelcoming  playerbase I have ever seen, and I played LoL for 5 years.
"
21145,"This game...
I started playing in November of 2020. I stopped playing shortly after (~10 hours of playing) because no friends of mine were playing. I picked it back up in late December and launched into a paladins frenzy/addiction, I was hitting 90 hours per two weeks. (Thanks covid!) I burned out of this in mid-may where I slowed down quite a bit, by then I didn't like the event pass (beach bash) nor had any reason to play. When the Gen:lock update show premired I was dragged into the game again. I now have around 15 hours per two weeks (likely to change) (AS of August-November I average about 4 hours)
Now onto the actual game.
Paladins is a hero shooter. If you don't like the aspect of shooter games this game is not for you. The two month gap between update can be troubling since there's not much torwards the end for regular players. (Lack of late update content) If you like grinding games and are willing to put a lot of time into the game this IS the game for you, heres why:
1. Grind gold for champ
2. Put in 40 hours for a golden skin
3. Long battlepass/eventpass
4.Weekly Pull-out-your-hair Trails
If you truly want to become ""the best"" there is competitive play. The climb can be quite vicious (be prepared)
Be ready to play flex (any role), Play meta (best champs/stats), and aimless toxicity.
So why play this game?
If you want a free multiplayer shooter to play with your friends this game is great.
>>Comparison<<
Paladins or Overwatch?
**I have alot more time in paladins so please know this isn't perfect**
Champions? Paladins with 50. (As of gl update) (Going to stop updating this, there is over 50)
Player-base? Both games can be really toxic or great.
Comp? Overwatch has OWL, Plus a better ranked system.
Early Game? OW for sure, you insta-unlock all the heros.
Late Game? Paladins, by a bit. There's more skins, emotes, sprays, titles, and borders. 
Graphics? OW easily has it (beware low-end computers/systems)
Paladins is f2p
Overwatch is 20$
Your choice
Overall, I do love this game and rate it 80/100
(be ready for bugs btw :))
THE BUGS. Maybe one day they will fix some of them! (Here's to hoping!)"

21147,Even tho this is an overwatch ripoff it still is fun to play also the tf2 barik skin is a fun addition to the game we need an heavy skin for buck and scout for victor
21148,its a fun and free alternative to games such as overwatch. the only downside is that you cant change you character once its been locked in but i guess it allows for fun and chaotic moments
21149,quick fun games no stress just shootin manz
21150,im so addicted
21151,"If you don't have Overwatch and you don't have enough money to buy Overwatch but you wanna play a game like this, I can recommend. But don't understand me wrong, the game is not good enough. I can recommend this game because there isn't any [b] free [/b] game like this. 

And finally there is a important advice from me:
If your pc is good enough to play Overwatch you should save money to get Overwatch while playing Paladins.
Have a great day <3"

21161,"Just a copy paste game thats unbalanced as fuck, if you were to play a decent dps or flank properly you could shred anyone no matter the character or class"
21162,it is a fun game i guess could be better
21163,lol
21164,It's a pretty good free version of Overwatch that can be run on crappy laptops like mine.
21165,Better than overwatch and it has crossplay :D
21166,"It was fun when I played it, haven't even touched it in 2+ years. It's fun, hands down would give 8/10"
21167,i am kind of neutral with this game. all i say is fix bugs. i have never made a game and most likely never will. but if you fix bugs your game will be more well recieved and more people will play it
21168,It's free and bad
21169,"Pretty good game if you ignore the sweats, try hards and the like. Unique characters that I found myself trying even if I thought I wouldn't like them. There are a lot of champions so you'll most likely find a character that suits your play style. The gold system is a bit weird as the notification will give you a different number than what you actually get but it's not a big problem. All in all I really like this game and have only had it for a little over a week. It's free so might as well try it right?"

21203,"Got this to play with some friends after a bad day, made the bad day not as bad. Really easy to pick up and learn, was fun even starting out and not really knowing what I was doing. Gameplay's solid, ran well on my 5+ year old laptop without issues. Like any f2p they try to sell you stuff but that's expected and I didn't feel like I was pressured into buying anything to have fun. I'll probably drop some money on it if I keep playing. It uses EAC though, so that sucks. Only real complaints I have are that like any other game I ran into a fair amount of bots/boosters and that kinda kills the fun, but matchmaking was quick. Didn't encounter any toxic players.

tl;dr: chill game to play with friends that know how to run party comps."

21209,"One of the better free-to-play games out there.

A nice hero-shooter that leans more heavily on it's moba side than games like Overwatch, Paladins focus more on combat versatility than pure objective-based gameplay.

The Deck, Items and Talents mechanics allow for countless combinations that makes it so two players selecting the same hero won't play quite the same way.

Everything tied to gameplay can be unlocked with the earnable in-game currency at a very acceptable pace.

Overall, the game is deep enough, well-enough built, and content rich to warrant you give it a go."
21210,"Its great but if you use a controller beware sometimes it will just randomly not work for certain games, so you have to quit or just sit there until its over and hope it works next time...I know people will say just use a mouse and keyboard but I like Controller so yeah"

21221,"Well... It's basically Overwatch, except less toxic with very cancerous champions to play with. Maeve and Skye are the type of champions that make you want to puncture your lungs with spring locks. It's nothing special, It's most fun with friends and can get boring after 5 matches. It can become repetitive and its not that type of game you would spend the whole day playing, its more of a play for 2 hours and get angry because there's a hacker in your game and to top that you cant leave a match, even if you quit the game and log back in it will still load you back into the game you tried to leave, so if you run into a hacker you best enjoy it. You might as well just play Fortnite or Rocket League for a less suicide and frustration inducing experience. 6 out of 10."

21268,"This game is just so much fucking fun, it's the game I've put the most time into on steam because I geniuenly really enjoy the gameplay. The game has a huge amount of issues, but I don't really care honestly because I think the core gameplay is just really satisfying. You should give it a try if you haven't already."
21269,"its like overwatch but with more content, its a bit hard to learn in the beginning but after a few games, you will understand it better :) And its free so you dont have to lose anything"
21270,"Stay away, Paladins is not worth the time. 
The concept of the game is pretty simple and sometimes it can be fun to play multiplayer with your buddies. And here comes the BUT... The game is completely broken. 

Prepare yourself to wait 10 min for a lobby just to get that lobby error message and wait a bit longer. Probably that's the reason why the competitive / ranked players are so toxic. Not mentioning that during my 61 hours of gaming I did not receive any of the 'skull' currency. 

The amount of payed content is another topic on its own. If you want to flex on your fellow buddies there is plenty of skins for most of the characters, although many of them are just copies in different color schemes. Then you have some emotes, sprays and other useless stuff that nobody wants, but you need something to fill the mystery boxes with, right. 

All in all the game is made to make money on you, so prepare your wallet."
21271,"fun but horribly unbalanced
"
21272,"i mostly am doing this because some of the skins need updating, cosmic and obsidian come to mind they are bland and look like a kinder gardener made it, they dont even look like their image, i also played with friends and the skilled based match making put us against bots when we are high level."
21273,vbjh
21274,this game fucking sucks
21275,"Very fun, better than overwatch"
21276,"Fun arena FPS. Has a bit of tactical decision making when it comes to what hero you play, your loadout, the map, what heroes your teammates are using, and so on. Pretty relaxing, low-punishment gameplay which is a nice alternative to the intensity of games like Valorant or CSGO."
21277," pro:
1- different gameplay and ability make this game so fun
2- high quality skins
cons:
1- Inaccurate Big hitbox even they don't match the character animation
2-No crouch
3-aim bot and braindead champoin like lex,lian
4-bad matchmaking
5-toxice player-base
6- teammate who disconnect and afk most of your match
7-blanace issue
8-get play vs E-sport and streamers as first match after long day work
9-some maps are bad design
10-bugs that stay in year without fix it.
11-petato server (EU)
12-this game on in unreal engine 3 so you cant use all your powerful pc resource."
21278,its fun to play with friends
21279,What an awful gaming experience this is. Absolutely no balance at all in hero strength. Skins are over priced and most of them aren't even cool looking. Can't switch heroes during a game for what reason? so if line up turns up to be a bad match to the other team well your screwed for the game. Terrible... just terrible.
21280,"Was fun when I played it, but I'm not a huge fan of the genre anymore. The game is complex and interesting, and if you're a fan of games like Overwatch, CSGO, Valorant, etc, you might like it :).
Personally, I don't enjoy games like this anymore, though."
21281,I haven't played any games on pc before and I'm generally not a fan of this type of game but for a free to play game it's really amazing and easy to get into

21293,"pros:
+cute characters
+somewhat addicting

cons:
-complete lack of team balance
-promotion of microtransactions (champions cost a whole lot, but you can buy crystals or a champion pack)
-there are only a couple things in the game that you can buy with the in-game currency, even if, you have to grind a lot for them
-another game with a battle pass which you have to pay for to get some actually good stuff
-generally a big ripoff

conclusion: if you dont have to, dont start playing this game for the sake of your bank account/steam wallet and your own mental health. Teams are extremely unbalanced in a way you always get team mates that just started playing champions that were in the game for years, and you get enemies that might as well play pro league. You're just wasting your time.
Steam's version of overwatch is free. Thats the only plus side lol the game is not that great. But also not terrible. Def worth a play if you just got your account and have like no games But yea not that great of a game. 32/100

Plus lobby is full of new players that ruin games constantly, you get no reward for loseing, coming close or even winning. 30 Matches and you might get 15k coins which is nothing. You constantly get kicked out of matches because if any of the 10 people disconect it disconects everyone and your Que resets or your kicked out of the match. AFK players farming XP constantly, Players purposly killing themselves constantly to XP gain other team. This game is just horrible, do NOT play it."

Are you wrought with wonder at your character being wasted as a bot takes the wheel from your cold lifeless connection?
Then this may be the game for you.
Seriously.
This game is a lot of fun
when you can play it.
The devs are completely aware of this issue, since it has been around since beta
However, they do not care enough to look into any type of long term fix,
as it would get in the way of micro transactions for the shareholders.
This game is good.
When you can stay connected.
Did you look at the main screen for more then 2 minutes? Disconnect.
Did you peruse the champions and their abilities for more than 45 seconds? 
Wait til you queue up my son, your punishment is coming.
Did you want to play with friends? 
Choose all but one to sacrifice, for only that chosen one will get into the game.

21374,"Everything good about the game: Card system so you can make a champion the most interesting for you to play possible, the talent system which gives champions cool interesting abilities, items allow you to counter other strategies so nothing is too op.


Everything bad about the game: Hi-Rez, Hitboxes worse than a 2008 game, certain items are a must-buy so you don't really have a choice, nobody here is happy, you can get insulted for running a non-meta loadout in the NORMAL MODE of the game, like Furia with Exterminate, Furries exist, Hi-Rez doesn't care about the bugs and just spams limited skins, every single new champion they add has abilities already in the game for example Vora has a ability that is the exact same as grover's plant spiderman thing, imani has fernando's fireball but higher damage.
you need to grind for 20 hours to obtain a single champion out of the 40 you'll be trying to unlock in the game, and even then you'll probably end up not liking it, cause honestly if you buy willow and play a match as her it'll be the ultimate challenge to last more than 40 seconds without leaving, the game also has chests which are just a scam and nothing more than that, the only thing worth buying is battle pass but the battle pass usually just contains skins for the exact same 15 or so characters because Hi-Rez ignores all other characters, honestly i would actually like this game if all champions were free from the start, because currently every single team is almost exactly the same, 2 flanks 1 damage 1 support 1 frontline, and there are characters which are just obvious power creep, like seris and ying, Seris has higher damage than ying, and better talents aswell as her base damage being bigger, seris has a MUCH better ult than ying aswell as a way bigger healing output and a better ability to escape out of danger, the only advantage ying has over seris is that ying can send her clones in to kill people for her, which deals such low damage that theres no real point in doing it, but its not like the clones heal for more than 2 hp every 10 seconds. Hi-Rez had a very interesting character customizing system which everyone liked, but then they removed it for no reason at all and i think that shows their approach to caring about this game, they don't actually take the people's opinions in consideration, they just sort of randomly nerf and buff every hero, especially since i've heard from some youtube videos that they are trying to balance every champion around a 50/50 winrate, which is just ridiculous."

21408,boring
21409,"After 200h put into the game sadly I need to give it negative review. I love the gameplay (actually prefer it over Overwatch) but constant crashes, bugs in every aspect of the game and poor matchmaking makes this game quite really hard to enjoy. Devs are more focused on another battle passes with more skins where game needs proper fixes. New champions are just mix of abilities of other champions, and their original abilities are not really working as they should. Reporting system doesn't seem to work with so many trolls, smurfs or unprepared players in ranked games.  Even shops have their problems with bounty shop being down constantly and had many issues when I couldn't earn points from missions.

I played 5 games on rank today:
1. Got 1 kid who said he can only play 2 characters with roles already taken, He shouldn't be allowed with his time spent in the game into ranked. Lost in last round in effective 4v5.
2. Easy 4-0 win, matchmaking put kids in enemy team, who started flaming each other after the game.
3. Actual good, balanced game. Won in last round.
4. Had a 2 smurfs in my team, who didn't even bother to hide, easy win. Yes, I reported them, but there is not even an option to report someone for smurfing.
5. My entire team crushed at 3-3 and only one person from opposite team, so they could push through bots. Lost miserably and unfairly.

If you are prepared to spend money for the game like this, just try Overwatch, it can save you a lot of disappointment. I paid for the champions pack which is really important if you want to get serious in ranked (not being able to save a character or swap with someone else put you in big disadvantage). Rest of the paid stuff can be in theory bought or awarded for game currency, but they are mostly cosmetics.

 I can recommend this game if you don't care about technical problems and want to enjoy gameplay (which is somewhat balanced with all it's complexity) when playing with friends. Beware that after reaching diamond rank you can team up only with one more player, so if you want your 5 stack you are forced to go in casuals after this point.

EDIT: After another 30 hours or so I've decided to uninstall the game. Nothing changes, too many crushes, people who shouldn't play ranked and in general the game is not fun anymore."

21452,absolutly<3
21453,"Initially the game is fun but when you play it more and more and have encounters with each and every character a major flaw in it's design shows itself: Everything deals too much damage. Let me elaborate.

Whenever you make a character which is based in dealing lots of damage you don't make it so if you pick the character you are guaranteed to get a lot of kills because it is not fun neither for the giving or receiving end, on one side it is very easy and the other it is very frustrating. The major problem isn't the damage numbers by themselves but the inability to consistently avoid damage. Because everything does a lot of damage you should be awarded for dodging and punishing with your own but because you can't you are just left frustrated because the other player chose to pick a certain character.

I like the game, but because of this it is getting less and less enjoyable."
21454,"It is Overwatch, but far better in every single way possible, if you play Overwatch or was considering getting it, then play this instead, it simply takes everything that makes Overwatch great and makes it so much better.

21468,"I loved the game initially. Played it before it got on steam. 
Wanted to play overwatch but couldn't afford it. Paladins was my go to then. 
It turned out good with Loadout initially but then there was a point it started going downhill.
Hi-rez started to experiment and tried as much to balance from that point but no matter what they try to fix it wasn't worth it because they would damage the game in another way. But it really didn't matter anymore with introduction of lazy champion designs more and more. Kinessa and Viktor: ok they were your basic fps classes, but this game isn't TF2! with gun, it was about magic and brawling focused. Clones designs like tyra, strix, lian were being made since they ran out of ideas. Dont mention Vivian she's born because whoever designed her probably the most laziest person in the world. Characters in paladins needed to work together to play effectively as a group it doesn't matter if every role was picked there were combinations that had too picked for team synergy and that's where champions like Vivian come in. Doesn't matter what your team or the enemy team is for her to play effectively. All she has to do is sit back and hold lmb and rmb. Flanks? Hahah she can detect them coming with her drones. And get the jump on them. Two flanks?! No problem has a shield. Her ult is here have some more dps since we think your dps is too low for being a DMG champion. Hitbox? Lol what hitbox. My ult buddy got destroyed but no problem I'm a deploy a 2nd time. But how? Because I can charge my ult even with my ult already active. Mean while old favorites like drogoz get nerfed because of console scrubs and Vivian trash mains that complained about hard it was to hit drogoz on wyrm jets. His hitbox is big, his rockets are projectiles that require leading since their aoe is dog shit. A fucking crossbow shoots faster than a rocket.
A Rpg projectile moves at a speed of around 300 metres per second so since drogoz uses a handheld it should atleast shoot at half the speed, a hunting crossbow shoots a a arrow at a speed of 500 feets per second converted to 150metres per second. But in this game however it doesn't matter the rockets move like fuck all and the fire rate is slower than kindergarten kid spelling the alphabet. You can't play him unless you have a healer and another champion to cover your ass. You have to have actual skill to use him and when you do you get punished and get your ass handed over to most of the champions in the roster. Drogoz isn't what he used to be , he used to be a flying nightmare but not he's just a fly waiting to get swatted out of the sky. Only way to play with him is now cowering behind covers and making safe plays. Can't go crazy like before especially how most of my matches are giving me the best EVAH! recently.
If anything I wouldn't be suprised if they decide to stack her ultimate with the direction hirez is going.
Game breaking bugs, random DC's, bad servers, I usually don;t write reviews but I writing this because at this point of time I couldn't get to play a game because as soon as the match started I was getting dced to login screen only to get stuck in a loop of relogin reloading and dced. I live in SEA and I'm getting 120-150 ping as opposed to 40-60 in the earlier days because HI-rez turned out to be just another greedy low rez company that doesn't polish the game rather just vomit as many champions as it can with skins and stuff.
Characters that need skill to play are getting nerfed more while the ones that need actual nerf aren't getting them.
The new champion Vora is as boring and uninspiring as well, grover+zhin= vora. 
And now they are going to introduce another character soon which looks promising but unbalanced asf.
They are straying too far from the original soul of the game. 
This might be the last time I replay the game."

21515,"It's a pretty fun and competitive game, a lot like Over watch. It is more fantasy styled though, and you do have to buy all the characters with in game currency or gems. It can be pretty hard to grind for someone to end up not being good with them at all. Otherwise, it can be a pretty fun game to play with friends as it has customs, which can be exciting late. Yes I would recommend this game to my friends."

21545,"[h1]A masterpiece which cannot be handled by their own creators[/h1]
That's how'd i describe this game. It used to be fun and entertaining game back in 35-45 OBT patches, right before Hi-Rez started spilling on us many and many new champions, which mostly were unbalanced piece of crap and groundbreaking nerfs  of others which led to some of them being left in the shadows of forgotten past. But despite all of this, the game is still [b]worth[/b] of playing it."
21546,"i always thought this was an overwatch knock off, boy was i wrong it;s 10x better then over watch!!!!!!!!!"
21547,good game
21548,"As a two day old player the Match Maker puts you in lobbies with players that have been playing for a long time. This game does not foster new players and throws them into the fold with really bad team mates vs really good players. In what reality is that fun, do you really think you'll retain new players this way? I am doing the best on my team and losing consistently, no thanks."

21562,very nice game
21563,Best Game Ever
21564,"Ok, What can i say except that this game is amazing. Many people think its just another dumbass Overwatch clone but genuinely it is pretty good. Sure it has some types of characters that are similar to Overwatch or some other games but for the most part the Characters are unique and i recommend this game to people who enjoy FPS games with Characters with certain abilities."
21565,Just play Overwatch it's so much better
21566,"This game saved my life.

I am 25.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline broken. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
21567,Yeah the game has been through alot. But they have kept it alive for a reason.
21568,gut
21569,"As soon as Hi-Rez and evil mojo started dropping the once a month champions this game went to complete shit. They started neglecting the many bugs and sever issues this community has been dealing with forever. Instead, they decided that they would farm paladins for every last drop of money they could before player base reached Zero. They drop 1 new champion a month, new skins weekly, yet cant fix a simple bug that keeps you on a loading screen for hours? Ranked matchmaking is a joke, I get matched with golds and silvers as a Master and I'm expected to carry and go 40/5 or lose. Sometimes you even get a 4.0 K/D and still lose because your team as 10 hours of playtime and has no idea what's going on. Evil mojo does NOTHING to address the hackers, cheaters, or pure toxic player base. 
But hey, they dropped a 10th ying skin and this recolor kinda dope."

""Hey, I don't play Paladins in a while, maybe I should try it. What could go wrong?""
Then 5 minutes later I'm angry with my own team, the enemy team and myself.

But then give me a few hours and later I am playing it again lol

Unfortunately there are less modes, more bugs and obtaining cosmetics is way more time consuming. Still a very good game, I definitely recommend to at least try it out."

21605,"The clearly superior game between this and Overwatch. This game isn't as polished as Overwatch but it makes up in better gameplay, mechanics, and balance. 

The Good - Hit detection is far superior to Overwatch and alot of other shooters that have been out in recent years. The characters are all for the most part pretty fun to play and all roles will have a character that you will enjoy. It is a great game to just casually play off and on as its easy to pick up and play a few rounds then move on. The Character designs are pretty unique and it has a charm for its aesthetic. This game does actually reward you for actually being good at it. It is possible to carry matches you should lose albeit they are hard and you have picked good perks and the character.  Balance feels for the most part pretty solid the only stand out overpowered character I felt was Inara but she was nerfed and doesn't feel as bad now. Unlike overwatches terrible character swapping mid match to ruin the balance of the game paladins opted in for a much better idea of giving you virtually perks or ""items"" (they aren't items they are perks) That you can buy in the match by killing/objective/time and they all have some uses the only real issue is that Cauterize is virtually manadatory on everyone since nearly everyone has some for of self sustain and you should be taking kill to heal every game on 90% of characters or life rip so that helps offset healing as well so those tie up 2-3 of the 4 slots you get and some characters really depend on having deft hands (a reload speed perk cutting it down by 20-40-60%) So you may be locked out of 4 perks and not be able to take a few of the counter perks like illuminate or i don't recall the name the one that reduces cc duration. But all though those are virtually mandatory its still a far better system of counter play then lol they have Roadhog pick zarya haha you lose trash design. 

The Bad - The monetization is atrociously anti consumer. So for new players getting new characters expecting to not pay is excessively bad. You can spend all day grinding and still wont be able to afford the highest gold tier characters further pushing you to want to spend money on it. I do think the pack for buying all champions forever is a decent deal but I don't like how bad it is forced on you and you can't realistically earn all the characters without sinking 1000's of hours to do so. Before I caved in and bought the character pack I had around 20 hours and I had afforded 1 60,000 and maybe 1 or 2 30,000. I can't recall to be exact but roughly around that and this is with the bonus starting gold new players get. Gold isn't super useful as its mostly cosmetic related which is fine just the amount that anything requires is ridiculous and the fact for mastery or character rewards you have to get the character to that level then pay your gold to unlock it instead of be given it for free is a rip off. Character leveling is extremely slow outside the 1st few levels and with a large portion if not most of the characters best talent from the 3 they get being normally the 8th level one it is also a big negative. And further to the cash monetization the skins for some really bad reason were almost all gated in old battlepasses which make them unobtainable completely or once in a blue moon to come back out or having to be found in a loot box. I may have some misinfo on how the skins work but majority are locked and obtainable by just picking the one you want and buying it. Some characters do feel a bit clunky to play unnecassarily from not being able to animation cancel some of your abilities like Dragos unable to use salvo without a full clip, Zhin unable to bellow to cancel his counterstrike things like this are minor but still a bit annoying.

The Why - Really this is just the mount system. It's really just tacked on and virtually useless since you can only use it at your spawn and it spawns you on it. It would be useful if you could mount up in the middle of a big map but can't outside getting to the point its just really tacted on and you wonder why they couldn't just make the maps smaller and not had the mount option since the perk for it is a noob trap. And fun fact you can literally unbind the key and you'll be fine.

All together if you are willing to spend 30 or 15 i think if you start its discounted to be cheap so if you never have played and see that advertisement i do recommend getting it for as cheap as possible to own all current and future heroes.  Then this game is I believe a good investment for fun. If you hate overwatch like me, or just want to play a different team based shooter like it and TF2,  Paladins may be a good choice for you. Even with the big bad segment i do recommend the game with its flaws. I'd rate the game as a whole 7/10."

21633,fun game
21634,Amazing game!
21635,this game is so unbalanced it can get. why did they make a tank with a lot of health that heals and does damage like crazy. wtf went through the devs minds? cant recommend.
21636,I have no real review but I like the game.
21637,"The game has lost it's spark. Too many new champions are added with recycled abilities, too many battlepasses and other ways hirez milks this game. The game used to be incredible but it has slowly become worse and worse. Nevertheless the game is still worth trying if you haven't given it a go yet, you have unlimited posibilities of playing each champion/character, so the game shouldn't get boring too soon. 

The game started going downhill after the rise of furia event imo. I still wish they brought back the gamemode payload with all the old payload maps. If the developers stopped adding a new champion every 4 weeks the game would be a lot better. 
"
21638,"1. Unbalanced as hell.
2. Matchmaking is garbage.(over 90% of the time playing with headless chickens. Hard to enjoy when your screen is plagued with the red screen of defeat. Checking the end result and seeing that the other 4 don't have a single kill, 10 deaths and 4 assist. If I could post a screenshot I would have.)
3. Toxic community. (Triggered crybabies)
4. Encountering too many players using assist tools. (Aim,Wall)
Played it back in 2017 and it was way better. Killcam needs to come back. It feels like the only people left in this game are the noobs that are trying the game, players that have invested too many hours/money/time in/for the game and hackers."

"
21650,"I originally got this game a year or more ago because I wanted an alternative to Overwatch. Some people call it a clone and while I see similarities, they aren't the same game. One of the reasons I've started playing Paladins more recently is that I enjoy playing it as a casual player rather than a competitive player, which removes a lot of the normal stressors I have with playing Overwatch. 

Also, my craptop can actually run Paladins at 40-60fps (medium graphic settings, 1080p), but it can only run Overwatch at 10-30fps with all of the lowest settings, which makes Overwatch unplayable as an FPS for me. 

As for Paladins, I've really come to appreciate the massive character roster over time. Normally I'm a flex player in class-based shooters, but I feel as though my skillset is much more niche in Paladins. This isn't a bad thing, I just think that my playstyle isn't suited to as many characters in Paladins as other games I've played. 

I really appreciate the diversity in race and ethnicity for both real and fantasy races. I also really appreciate that there are gay pride profile pictures available for pocket change in game. I really love that the developers showed their support for the LGBTQIA+ community with that. It made me feel a lot more happy with the game, even if I'm not part of the community myself. 

Overall, I get an itch to shoot stuff in video games sometimes, Paladins has been my go-to game to scratch that itch for the past few years. If I had to issue one complaint, it's that I wish cosmetic items were more accessible to f2p players. I've paid to unlock all heroes and have played for 55 hours at the time of writing this review, and still have probably less than 10-20 skins for different heroes (thankfully, I have some for most of my favorite characters). The game is f2p and I understand that Paladins probably makes all of its money through its battle pass and cosmetics, but I wish I had the option to get more skins without paying money. 

It's possible that those opportunities exist and I missed them because I'm a casual player that just hops on to play whenever I'm bored or want to shoot stuff. But, that's my experience. Thanks for making such a great game and I'm looking forward to seeing its continued development as new characters are released!"
21651,rlly nice game
21652,"Very very good animated game, cool champions, i like this game <3"
21653,Fun free to play game to enjoy with friends or even make some along the way with unique characters that have interesting abilities each person requires new and well reformed tactics to use.
21654,"Awesome team-based FPS! I love the amount of different champions you can play with and the colorful graphical style of the game. The only thing I have to critisice, is the fact, that you can barely get stuff for free, to customize your profile and your heroes.
This game is so much fun, just give it a try!"
21655,nice game
21656,dogshit game. mainly matchmaking in ranked. its tilting but its fun as hell as a free fps hero shooter. the devs are cool

21687,"I'll say one thing or maybe a few things. Both good and bad in my opinion.

The game is very good, game play is well, the mechanics can be buggy and the game can tend to crash sometimes but otherwise the game is pretty good. I enjoy the cross-play that was implemented in the game, I actually haven't had many issues with playing cross-play before. Though I don't really play paladin's at all on the computer, I know their servers aren't all that different. Don't @ me at that though if I am wrong about the servers ._.

 Now The bad part about it is where they basically reduce and continuously reduce the hero's ability's just because of a small portion of people who complain about character's being ""too op"" or ""broken"". Also why, just why add a healing reduction, damage do damage as it is, the healing reduction sometimes makes it really frustrating to heal, it makes healers feel like no matter what they do their healing just wont suffice. Like Ughh.

Anyways, On the character topic, I'm not saying there isn't ever any issues with characters possibly being bugged, the characters can be broken sometimes, i'm well aware of the fact that there is times when new updates come out and the game has a million different bugs. There even tends to be some hackers who like to casually take advantage of the game as well. Though that can really happen with any online game. 

In all honesty though, It's definitely a great game and I'd recommend it to other's. Just be prepared for a lot of bugs when new characters or battle passes come out, takes about a good month before everything actually gets fixed and there isn't as many bugs."
21688,Amazing game
21689,FUCK
21690,Best Game Ever
21691,"Its fun if you experiment, very related mechanics to Overwatch, the company sucks it but the rest is OK"
21692,rip off of overwatch but still fun
21693,"""Free Overwatch with the gameplay of Fallout: New Vegas 3/10"""
21694,hi rez is actually buying reviews nowXDDD this game has one shovel load of dirt before it is buried to the end of time and a majority of people still playing just play to stare at female champions like saati and end up leaving tha match to go have a fantasy wank over her SAVE YOURSELF DONT LISTEN TO REVIEWS THEY ARE BOUGHT
21695,"Play two games of Paladins, You'll have some fun, find a character you like, and you might get a triple kill with your Ultimate. Then you realise that until you reach Level 5, you fight bots, you get past Level 5, play a game. The rest is Misery. But at least its free."
21696,"It's like overwatch but with more titties
Very nice"
21697,"good game
"
21698,This game is fun!
21699,"it is the kitties fucking  titties, love it"
21700,They removed my Founder's pack...
21701,"Paladins is one of the only hero shooters I actually like, the characters are distinct and easy to pick out in a fight by their silhouettes."
21702,"Aside from the bug fixes and the polish this game needs, it's actually pretty fun and well made game. It has enough features and differences to not just be considered an ""Overwatch Clone"". You can call me impressed in that regard.

The reason I'm giving this game a bad review however is for two reasons that go a bit hand-in-hand.

1. Matchmaking
2. New Player Experience

The Matchmaking has absolutely dumbfounded me time and time again, matching me against players with play-time on a single character that is approximately 10 times that of my total play-time. The amount of games I've played that have been 4-0 wins or losses is just way too damn high. There's absolutely no fun in stomping others or just getting straight stomped yourself. Maybe it's because the game doesn't have a player base as big as it's competitors but regardless it's frustrating playing for a couple hours and only getting 1 or maybe 2 good games in.

I want this game to succeed but the matchmaking really makes the game unbearable at times. Early on I was seeing myself playing solo at times but now I think I'm only going to play this game with my buds in the future."
21703,"this game is fun like overwatch but it's free and i like this more than overwatch anyways
"
21704,OMG <3 I love this game!!!

21710,kek
21711,This game is one of my fav games its just like overwatch but free. Sometimes this game makes you want to jump out a fucking window and sometime this game makes you feel like your the best gamer out there. In my opinion this game is a legend that should last forever.
21712,"I don't really know what to say about this game. Its fun? I think? Not a fan of the graphics or the direction of boob skins with jiggle physics, but eh its free. If you are looking for a free game to take up some boredom and have some fun team fights here and there. This is your game."
21713,It fucking sucks
21714,"awesome game, a mix of League of Legends with the purchaseable items and Overwatch with the diverse range of heroes/champions to choose and master"
21715,Very cool
21716,I'ts very funny!

21720,"Bugadins... The Ridiculous, never-ending bugs. The toxic community. Pants on head game design choices. Yet, I keep coming back."
21721,d
21722,"Very similar to the title ""Overwatch"", however I think it's a lot better personally.

1. It's free, which is awesome.
2. Pretty much all the champions are decent to play as.
3. Wide range of characters to choose from.

Would recommend if your looking for a team based game."
21723,Paladins is a nice mix of a hero shooter with moba-lite elements. It's fun to play with friends and has a high skill ceiling. The devs have polished this game nicely over the years and it's become one of my groups go to's.
21724,better than overwatch
21725,"nn
"
21726,all players are spray but it's a okey game
21727,good free game
21728,gud
21729,"I think this is only me but my paladins keeps on crashing on the launcher screen, can someone hep me with this ;-;"
21730,"I have around 6000 hours total played on this game and well this game has seen better days.

This game used to be much more about individual skill but has been slowly pushed into a game where you heavily depend on your teammates. 

The constant nerfs to mobility while buffing the burst dmg has heavily changed the feel and flow of the game it honestly is starting to feel  more and more like Overwatch with every patch so those jokes about it being a Overwatch clone are starting to become relevant.

However the biggest issue in the game a the moment is the atrocious matchmaking it honestly feels more like a lottery than it being about your actual skill it's not uncommon that platinum rank players play vs grandmasters, add to the the fact that last picks are usually people that just started ranked and will pick whatever they want not what the team actually needs and it can happen often that you lose purely because that one teammate didn't take a tank or support and you're left without one of those roles

meta has become stale as well currently there a so many broken champs there is no way to ban them all and if the other team secures them it's usually gg champions like IO makoa torvald are very frustrating to play against as the have powerful abilities which require little skill to use and are quite overpowered 
for example makoa can build a loadout where you can get a shield reset if someone shoots his shield this can lead to him having a shield up 24/7 
or io having 15% dmg reduction to anyone she heals which makes them insanely tanky
meanwhile torvald gives the flank 1000hp a 50% movement speed boost and extra ammo while also healing him for a small amount 
even with wrecker the enemy still has a decent advantage vs you just because torvald  pressed q on him


Tl.dr is this game worth playing? : Kind of, I mean it's still the best hero shooter but it's nowhere near as good as it used to be I still suggest you try it out but  please please learn to play all roles decently before you go into ranked YOU are the one who can help fix matchmaking since apparently hirez doesn't give a damn

21761,"My First Game Review

I just started PC Gaming and when I wanted to find games that are simple by design and gameplay, I found Paladins to be just that. So far my enjoyment for the game is good! I feel that this game is good for beginners for the FPS genre or for those who want something not to ""technical"" or stressful.
My experience on casual play has been enjoyable. So far on all of my causal games, there wasn't any toxic chat. BUT I can't say the same for Ranked, when there is ranked, there are players who are competitive. My ranked experience is bad. Toxic chat and players judging your character level and constant spam on the call-out commands, it wasn't fun. but that was my experience. but still Watch Out.
Overall, the game is enjoyable! Its not Pay to Win and I think this game is very creative when it comes to character design and cosmetics, if your looking for casual play. stick to casual. If your competitive, then I guess go for ranked, you just have to deal with the toxic players."
21762,Very fun.
21763,great game its mostly balanced you can play a more casual game if you do onslout or tdm but more sweaty if you do seige
21764,good game people
21765,I ABSORBED TERMINUS ULT WHILE I WAS TERMINUS AND THEN HE STARTED FLOATING WHEN HE DIED THAT'S EPIC
21766,Grohk lobster!
21767,i only play because my friends cant buy a better game
21768,"Pros:
- Free
- Gameplay is really good
- Champion (playable character) loadout customization
- Easy to pick up/ learn a Champion
- PvAI that isn't just Tutorial
- Bounty Store
- Dev team is at least trying to do their best :)
- Not very intensive for PCs

Cons:
- F2P joys (Grindy AF, Microtransactions) 
- Only ""popular"" Champions get skins anymore (devs know)
- Lots of bugs
- Only 3 game modes
- Often toxic community"
21769,yes gud

21772,"good game especially been free to play,lovely graphics!"
21773,Yes
21774,good stuff.
21775,"Really fun, lots of characters to choose from. I like that you can add items to your champions each round, allowing yourself to play that champion in different ways. It's pretty much League and Overwatch's love child."
21776,epic game
21777,yes
21778,"Playing this game, with randoms, is a highly frustrating experience, most of the time they do not care about team composition or team play. Just running blindly forward and feeding the enemy team, or from far away doing some pew-pew and disregarding the objective. Which results in a lost and frustrating match.

However, if you play with friends, it is a super fun game."
21779,gut gut

but is kinda fun very fps based moda"

21782,its just a good game
21783,"I would say this game is really fun, this is my first type of game like this and i honestly love it so far! Been playing it with a couple friends every night and its so much fun. Its a team based game, so i would recommend playing with friends honestly. Cause at the end of the day, playing with friends will be fun regradless of the game. But I've spent the past couple nights playing for hours and not even noticing how much time has passed. That is what kind of game this is, and I would give it a try.

21816,"[b]Overview[/b] - Paladins is a champion shooter that was taken out of early access in 2018. The game itself has three game-modes with the main mode being Siege, a fast 5v5 mode with the goal of capturing a point and pushing it's payload to the enemies spawn. The other two modes consist of an average Team Death-match and Onslaught, which is a mode to hold a point till one team reaches the point goal. The game is of course based around it's champions which have reached up to 46 different characters. The newest champion being Vora as of this review's writing. Each character is fairly balanced with a small few taking the meta's spotlight for that update. The biggest feature in my opinion is every champion's ability to have a custom load-out. This system allows a player to change a card deck and slightly edit abilities and stats in small ways that fix to the players chosen play-style. This allows extremely varied character style and game-play. 

[b]Pros[/b] - Paladins itself is varied in it's matches, with the high amount of characters and playstyles making every game feel different and competitive in a enjoyable way. The loadout system is fairly simple, easy to learn, fun to use and perfect for customizing a person's play style. The game is constantly updated with every patch bringing new content, bug fixes, balance changes and other small fixes. There are no pay-to-win features which allow's everyone to have fair matches based on skill. Everything bought is used for cosmetic reasons, let it be skins, death-cards, avatars, or even music. 

[b]Cons[/b] - With every good thing about Paladins there are a few small bad's. The biggest complaint I see with this game is it's extremely toxic community. Every once in a while you might play a game and be verbally attacked by a single player or possibly a whole stacked team calling you bad, trash, or something similar. Another complaint would be older characters not getting enough attention compared to newer champions. Most players would point to Torvald and Pip. A few other problems might come from performance hiccups or crashes. 

[b]Final Statement[/b] - Overall Paladins is a fantastic game held-back by a few problems and a bad community. The game itself has many enjoyable moments and allows a lot of play-style customization, replay-ability, and over-all fun. Personally I see the game getting better and better over time, with the newest updates showing the developers getting better with their craft. The art team (Specifically Thunderbrush for being the most noticeable) make some fantastic splash-art for the character with each piece being beautiful and satisfying to look at. I suggest for a people to install the game and try it personally to see if they enjoy it or not. 

[b]Final Rating[/b] - 8/10"
21817,"The game itself is beautiful, and the community is very accepting and kind. The game is very fun to play even alone, but the best is playing with friends. It brings a very warm feeling to ones heart just to become attached to the characters. All the champions are fun to play and learn. 100/10"

21827,"I mean, it's an fps game, if you aren't good at them, then don't. But, it definitely feels balanced compared to some other fps games because every character has their own way to play, the item shop is limited to the same 12 things to make it less confusing over all, and the character gameplay overall feels different for each one. (except for honestly Vivian, Tyra, and Victor)"

21892,"This game definitely has a lot of bugs and it's really frustrating how theres so few unlockable items with in game currency but it's a lot of fun. It feels like a less stressful version of Overwatch, definitely more friendly for beginners. Dislike how they force you to only play with bots for the first 5 account levels. While this is definitely helpful so that brand new players aren't totally lost in people's actual games, someone who is coming from Overwatch or from console will only need a couple games to get the hang of it, and then end up stuck playing bots for a bit. I really like the variety of characters and the maps are fun."
21893,.
21894,No
21895,pretty pog
21896,Good game napred samo!!!
21897,Can't afford overwatch? Then this game will definitely suit you well.
21898,"its like overwatch but free
"
21899,"I love Deathmatch, but I am also aware that it is a dying game mode. 

Paladins is one of the more recent games that is helping to keep it alive and with the all of the unique abilities that come with each Champion, it mixes each engagement enough to where it's not the same thing over and over again.

I think the production quality does not reach AAA, 5-star studio quality and that's important to mention because that might be the selling point for some people. If that is the case, I implore you to set your differences aside and play the game for a day or two. Find a character you might be able to tap into.

Once you start tapping into Champion loadouts, you'll start to see how this game actually plays very smart. Whether you go DPS, Tank, Support, etc. you have the ability to capitalize on certain aspects of your build that might suit you well in combat. Depending on what you choose, it can work for (or against) the composition of your team's build. 

The Payload pushing mode is not bad, but I personally would say that it's not the game's main attraction. If you're looking for a F2P Overwatch, I can understand why you are looking at this game, but when you own and play both, you see how differently they handle and they are hard to hold next to each other, despite the number of similarities.

If you're trying this out for the first time, I would DEFINITELY try out Deathmatch first, Siege second, and Payload only if you insist. 

This game is cross-platform. I actually had more hours on my Nintendo Switch, but I was able to migrate my Switch account over to PC and I've been playing more frequently on PC. It has a large (and growing) e-sports community, which is quite exciting to watch!"
21900,This game is a direct copy of overwatch. only its buggy. Pay to win. less fun. Shitty graphics. there is no match making. you can get level 0s in a level 125 in the same match.
21901,good game but very much bugs
21902,Don't download
21903,"LOVE PALADINS SO MUCH I HAVE IT ON MY XBOX AND MY BROTHER""S SWITCH"
21904,"I love to play this game with my friend at my home , so we played by swiching who played :D"
21905,Nice experience
21906,"really boring game after 45 hours for playing. Takes forever to play other characters, and many plays almost the same."
21907,"I played both Paladins and Overwatch, and i can tell easily the main reason I think paladins is the better game is because of gameplay, not being forced into roles so that you have triple tanks double support, triple damage solo tank solo healer, or double tank double healer solo damage (just certain maps things work better) and I would compare things like in game communication as well as customization (big reason I don’t like Overwatch that much is because of the lack of creativity with voices for different skins) and the comparison of difficulty. Overwatch just seems to based off of who has the better ultimates on their side to win a team fight, and I highly dislike that.

"
21929,Furry person shooter (fps)
21930,very fun game
21931,Paladins
21932,"I have played this game for quite a while, though previously on ps4, the gameplay is tight and responsive, and quite easy to pick up, but the skill ceiling is high enough to allow for competative play without it getting boring.

all of the champions are quite unique and feel very different to play and the game offers a wide variety of playstyles, however the best chamions are locked behind paywalls, which if you know what exact;y you want, you can get to in just a few matches (only took me 3 to save up for my favorite champion, mal'damba) the problem comes when you don't know what you want and you want to sample all of them, you'd have to make a serious time investment to maybe find a champion you like, so it encourages paying to get all of them. I can't say this is awful though, it is a free to play game, the devs have to make money somehow, and it only costs $15, which seems fair, but I understand if you can't pay that

tldr; get this game if you know your way around team based fps's or if you have $15 to spend on extra content"

21934,Better than overwatch

21936,fun game fast paste and striaght action
21937,Its a fun and chill game
21938,"I loved this game with all my heart, I mean it truly was one of my favorite games by far with over 500 hours on the game, however I do not own a pc, instead I have a Mac el capitan handed down to me, this means that I can no longer play the game which is very sad, I really truly hoped they would bring back mac compatibility as I was very sad and angered at how I can spend like 200$ on a game only for them to take it away from me with no compensation. I don't know what the future for this game and the mac will hold, I am going to try to download apple bootcamp to see if that works but I am very dissapointed to see one of my all time favorite games become unplayable for me, I am sure that I am not the only person who feels this way and that there are other people who just want to be able to play again, whether this happens or not may or may not be possible. But best of luck to Hi-Rez and the community, this game is great if you can play it."
21939,"Paladins free to play but it will eat your wallet.
Overwatch pay to play but all heroes are free and there is no cheaters."
21940,fun
21941,it is cool
21942,"Overwatch, but with cards..."
21943,"Best game ever
"
21944,"This game is a pretty good alternative to other class based shooters. Titanfall 2 is always gonna be my favorite, but this is great for playing with others. Playing with others also makes its less savory aspects easier to swallow. The game suffers from a juvenile aesthetic, bad balancing, and gratuitous fan service. However, most characters are quite fun to use, from Maeve to Terminus."
21945,"This game might be fun, and it surely is worth your time."
21946,good game :D
21947,"oberwatch 
"
21948,nice
21949,"This game reminds me of Overwatch, Team Fortress 2, and has the aesthetic which reminds me of League of Legends. As someone who likes all those games, this is a nice take on this type of game. The game does have some bugs with loading but the gameplay seems pretty bug free and the fact that this game is also free to play makes it even better. I definitely will be playing this game a lot.
Edit: One of the Champions are really bugged and I'm unsure of how to report the bug. Its the dragon summoning Champion when she gets out of her ultimate, her primary fire and her abilities don't work anymore. I really love playing this hero, but she really needs to be fixed"
21950,"Pretty decent for the game that it is for free.
"
21951,Its fun
21952,"its a good game but its hard

21953,"Just as windows 10, expect each update to break things."

21955,good
21956,"overwatch free version but i prefer paladins, it's so good i really love it! thanks."
21957,its cool Iguess
21958,"Yeeser i beleive paladins does overwatch better than overwatch. Not including vivian. Vivian takes no skill but everyone else is fine. paladins allows players create there own metas while overwatch doesnt. Winning a game of paladins is only determine by how good you are at the game. Overwatch is a rock paper scissors, one character completly counters another. If you dont use the complete counter of your enemy teams comp you will lose. I know this cause i got 30 hours on overwatch."
21959,"It's a good game 
Way better than overwatch"
21960,takes 5 tries to open the game and then i have to pray it doesnt crash

21969,I used to play all the time in beta before the battle royal came out and it was such a fun game its not just free overwatch although its very similar a 12 year old could play it and have a good time but also a 30 year old could hop on with some friends and have a good time its one of those games that anyone could play its easy to understand but also there is a good depth to strats I highly recommend playing it if you have not
21970,"not that bad of a game 
unless u play ranked"

22020,its cool
22021,Piece of #@$!% almost fried my gaming PC after exiting a match.
22022,"this game is well worth it, big selection of different characters to choose from, i play it all the time."
22023,"Incredibly fun and addicting. Way deeper than Overwatch with the loadouts, talents, and items. Much larger hero pool as well which adds to the depth. This game deserves all the support it can get. Uninstall Overwatch, and uninstall Battlenet while you're at it."
22024,i like the fighting dont really like people being rude in chat tho i think there should be a filter on the chat tbh
22025,Giving another HiRez game a try. Hope it gets developed and doesn't die like Realm Royale.
22026,"Honestly this game is a ""Poor Man's Overwatch"" IMO, save up enough money until you can play Overwatch."
22027,"Tl;dr: Lots of fun characters to try with customizable loadouts, though you do have to grind to unlock most of them (unless of course you're willing to pay some money to unlock them). Bring friends for the best experience. Expect the occasional crash or disconnect.

Paladins is a fun team-based hero-shooter, with a wide selection of Champions to choose from (though you only have a select few unlocked at the start unless you buy the Champion's Pack) and you can change how you play them with the Talent and Loadout system.  However, I would STRONGLY recommend you grab a couple friends to play with you.  

Solo queue-ing in Paladins is entertaining at best, but infuriating at worst.  Playing with a team of randoms while going up against high-ranked players or a team that is obviously coordinating via something like Discord is often one-sided. The causal modes will only have voice chat enabled for the other players are in your party, so no voice communication with random teammates. There is a VGS (Voice Guided System) to make your character say callouts, but I've found that takes some getting used to in order to use effectively, and even then your random teammates may not heed your callouts.  Also, because you cannot see what the enemy has selected  until everyone is locked in, it can lead to infuriating games where your team composition is hard-countered.

Ranked mode does have team voice chat enabled and a pick/ban system, so games should (theoretically) be more evenly matched and should alleviate some of my criticisms above, but in order to play ranked you need a certain number of Champions unlocked. I have not played ranked mode, however, and cannot say with certainty that the experience is better than casual modes.

Additionally, be prepared for occasional crashes and disconnects.  I've had this happen to me more frequently than with any other game I've played, and when it happens the disconnected player is replaced by a Bot, which is almost worse than just playing a 4v5. There's also no obvious notification when a player is replaced by a Bot, so you may not even realize a teammate has disconnected until you see their character meandering straight into the objective. Fortunately, disconnected players can reconnect, so if they can reboot their game quickly, the amount of time the Bot has to feed into the enemy team is minimal.

Despite my criticisms above, I've had a lot of fun playing this with my friends. I've enjoyed trying out different characters, experimenting with loadouts and trying to find ways to best synergize with my friends. A few rage moments, sure, but that's to be expected with any competitive game."
22028,yes
22029,"really great gameplay, tons of different champions to choose from, well optimized and free to play? yes please"
22030,"not if you are looking for skill based matchmaking, that does not exist here. other than that great game!"
22031,"Despite Hi-Rez's best attempts, its a good game"
22032,Scuffed version of overwatch
22033,GREAT GAME
22034,"I've had a ton of fun playing the game, haven't played it in awhile and it has change drastically. The new champions definitely spice things up. I love the creative modes the game releases for a limited time. Although compared to Overwatch comparing the two the play style are very different. I definitely have a sweet spot to how Paladins matches play out compared to how they run in Overwatch."
22035,yes
22036,just a fun game

Back in beta everyone was friendly and paladins was one of my favourite games, but its just an empty shell of what it used to be now. Would i still recommend it? sure, its not bad and if you can handle the toxic fanbase its very enjoyable."
22061,cool
22062,overwatch but free
22063,wow what a great game!
22064,"Develpers stole my Dragonborn Moji skin. I remember it was given few months ago just for free. Since you stole one of my given items is that possible you stole another one I've purchased before?! It's not acceptable in any form to touch anyone's game items, even if it was given by a mistake, that's your fault not mine. Keep your pockets safe from such a thiefs."
22065,"Based on everything I had heard about this game, I thought it was going to be a terrible Overwatch clone, but I honestly enjoy playing it more than OW. Yeah, a bunch of the characters are shameless clones from other games, but I'm still having fun."

22081,bathing in the sewers is probably more enjoyable than this

22083,cool heroes
22084,"I highly recommend that you play Paladins.

The Paladins community can be very self-consuming and the game has been declared dead 100 times by now, almost as often as TF2. However I believe that right now is a golden era of the game that you should experience while it still lasts. As of writing this, infinite shield Makoa and [i] Burn Monster! [/i] Tyra are the largest balance issues the game faces. While these are issues that are certainly deserving of changes, I find that as a whole, Paladins is in a really good place. It has a high and consistently playing base. The content we've gotten hasn't always been perfect but the newest champions we've received, like Vora, Raum, Tiberius, Atlas, etc. have all been A+ additions. Not to mention that we've seen positive reworks of older maps, Frozen Guard especially. The real issue with the game at the moment is just that balance changes are sometimes slow to come, leading to long periods of meta dominance. However, something that makes Paladins so special is that although there is a ""meta"", virtually any team composition can work so long as the players are skilled and choose characters that compliment each other properly. Even deeper than that is the ability to create card loadouts for each champion, meaning that an experienced player can transform a champion that is often ignored by the meta into a powerful fighting force that compliments the uniqueness of that individual's playstyle. While HiRez definitely has a lot of control over which champions are best, the players have an equal amount of say over the matter as they develop loadouts in creative, personal, and often surprising or unpredictable ways. For this reason, Paladins continues to grow not only because the developers continuously add content, but also because players slowly develop playstyles and tactics for their favorite champions, perpetually heightening their own learning curves and becoming better players as a result.

I have nearly 600 hours of play spanning many years. I remember when payload was the premier game mode in this game, if you can believe that. I have had my ups and downs with this game as I lose and regain interest, but there have been few instances where I join a fivestack and don't have an absolute blast game after game. If you're into cooperative fantasy shooters, I cannot recommend this game enough."
22085,love that

22087,Cross bow woman is op.

22104,"Seeing as it's free I recommend it as a option to OW, tad more casual this game then that which is not a bad thing. Only really bad thing is menus in this game, changes with each patch and it's made to suit kids it seems... the more dorky and shit it is the better. Just decide on a nice, solid and easy to look at theme and stick with it. Biggest minus is the menus."
22105,"Even thou this game is not an overwatch ripoff, cause it started before overwatch.
And even thou this game was quite good on the start.

22137,sniper tf2
22138,Fairly beginner friendly multiplayer shooter experience with lots of unique characters and weapons that can be a lot of fun to master.
22139,GOO
22140,great game
22141,nice Overwatch alternative.
22142,"I loved this game on xbox one s. I would play again with same characters in a heart beat. I love it. i just love it. i do. Some bugs that need fixing but over all, there is nothing i have to really say bad about it. :] I love the cool graphics, my friends."
22143,:)
22144,"didn't work very well. i have already install this game successfully twice, but it's still stuck at the hi rez or anti cheat loading screen. the game won't open, i try to reinstall the hi rez launcher but it still didn't make any change. this just wasting my time. what a trash"
22145,Better than Overwatch tho.
22146,good
22147,goated

22149,bad game
22150,"bomb king is love and lif

22151,"Really bad. Game used to be good, but devs have no clue how the balance the game and they always add weird shit that makes no sense. Overwatch is better in every way."
22152,yes
22153,goooooooooooood
22154,"Good Game. I like it, even the DLC is good"

22158,"overwatch, but cooler"
22159,Didn't play too much but quite good
22160,"its kinda like overwatch but almost every hero is locked damn it I used to be a Vivian main level 60+ mastery and  had realized i could spend coins to upgrade her less then a week before she became locked so then i just stopped playing entirely (this was all before i got overwatch btw) now im returning and sadly shes still locked but its alr 

6/10 for gameplay (only 3 modes, generic)
8/10 for characters (alot like overwatch, VIktor espceically reminds me of Soldier 76)
10/10 for map design (looks very nice/unique)
9/10 overall
but -2 for looking like EA with this character lock bs
7/10 total"
22161,Steam's version of overwatch is free. Thats the only plus side lol the game is not that great. But also not terrible. Def worth a play if you just got your account and have like no games But yea not that great of a game. 32/100
22162,"I mean haven't spent a huge amount of time playing it but its a decent hero shooter if not a bit shameless in its similarities to Overwatch. If you're considering it I would say download it and give it a shot, heads up though for the majority of my first hand full of games I was sorted in with bots without warning, unsure if this has changed but I do think some sort of notification saying you would be placed with bots till a certain level would be helpful."

22216,Its a good mashup of shooting games with abilities. A little bit of more tweaks is necessary as low fps is an issue even with a decent computer. Anyway its a good game you should try it once at least before ignoring it.

22248,"Tanks feel powerful when backed up correctly, supports are genuine threats that should be taken care of as fast as possible, flanks can cripple teams if one or two players are out of position and damages can shred through enemies disgustingly fast. No matter what role you're trying out, all of them have significant options to turn the tide of a team fight. You don't understand how important that is to someone that has to flex every match due to teammates instalocking dps."

22251,"Very Good.
Overwatch But free and better."
22252,i have overwatch but i play this more

22255,i love this game
22256,"very nice game. good graphics, sorta-balanced characters/heroes and really good gameplay. would totally recommend"
22257,does the balance team even play the game? no.
22258,just like overwatch i like this game it don't have pay to win or something they force you to buy very nice game if you you should try it if you are searching for something fun and fun :D

22265,"I mean it does the job. It's a great game when you play it with friends and horrible when you play it solo when you get full teammates who just joined or started the game who don't know what they're doing so just rework the auto balancing need work, with the constant bugs that have never been fixed for years. 

Then no matter what I think finally the game will be in a playable state."
22266,Eh.
22267,"Update: Before I played this i had no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good

Been playing on switch since 2018, just got it on pc and runs smooth and still fun :D"
22268,itz gud
22269,I think it's A Very Nice Game. It's Exciting And Cartoony. If You Like Shooting Games Then This Is A Game For You! There Are Some Minor Bugs. And Sometimes Low Graphics. But That Will Resolve Itself. BTW This Is The First PS4 Game I Ever Played (On 2016)

very very good"
22290,I'm having truble with the game whenever I click on it shows a Hi-Rez studios loading screen than the screen gose away and when i go into steam the same thing hapens.
22291,"Paladins is a FREE PvP game!

You can play a selection of different gamemodes with your friends!
The main thing i like and i presume many others would feel the same is the characters and each of there own special and diverse abilities and how u can form an unbeatable team.

Theres a character for everyone, You like Huge damage dealers? Healers? Tanks? Flanks? it has it all!
With the option to customise your favourite character however u like! 
Many excellent and very satisfying kills, teamwork strats (etc) can be had here, I strongly recommend if you like the way it sounds!

I promise you wont be dissapointed.  10/10"
22292,"great game 
I love it the fun part also is when I tell people playing I am a 60 year old Grandma!
lol"
22293,"Fuck this game, thus is a pervers game"

22298,"This game is amazing with the card system and loadouts, although could really use some work on bugs and updates, ive been playing this game for almost 2 years now, and although ive upgraded my pc i see myself coming back to this one a lot, it is for sure better than overwatch compared to price and specs also its more competative then overwatch,
the community is small but loyal and fun,... i hope to play this game for coming years."
22299," Worth playing. Don't compare it to similar games. 

 At first it felt like a bad copy of other games, and in some cases of style and art it is. The gameplay leans more towards strategy and less on aiming ability, although some characters are satisfying enough for FPS vets. It's easier to play than other class based shooters, and very new player friendly. 

 Fun to play casual shooter. I come back to it when I just need something to play."
22300,basically overwatch but free
22301,very sexc caracters make me oowoo
22302,"its pretty paladins
"
22303,"Definitely my preferred Champion-Style FPS! Ranked can be toxic, but it's an e-sports game, so you should honestly come to expect this by now. 

New champs are usually really fun, and they haven't ceased being creative with the releases as of yet!!"
22304,[p
22305,woooooooooo love the game is hella sexy
22306,"Great free game, few modes like TDM, onslaught and another, many champions all can be unlocked for free with enough time. Fun, but for some reason on steam it crashes everytime i attempt to open the game, so i got it on epic games instead where its working, however paladins on epic games doesnt have controller support for xbox controllers, so its impossible to play the PC version of the game on controller. Tried submitting support tickets at Hi-Rez's website but you literally fill out the entire support request document and the ""Submit"" button on the bottom is broken. Tried multiple times. So, the game doesnt work at all on steam, controllers dont work with this game on Epic Games, and the support page on their site is broken beyond repair so dont expect any help from hi rez on this. Whatever, has such potential."
22307,nice
22308,its not overwatch

1 - There's a lot more characters, each with their own play style
2 - There's infinitely less porn
3 - Much more laid-back fanbase
4 - Completely Free, with the option of putting money into it"

22333,"Fun shooter game if ur bored
"
22334,good
22335,"This game is the most unbalanced game i've played. Don't get it in this state. TRUST.

Pros:
-Amazing to play with friends
-Crossplay
-Plenty of characters 80% being fun.
-Mostly friendly community.
-Hit detection works. (because hitboxed are inflated)
-Movement characters
-Character levels to get gold skins is actually sick.
-The skins are really nice (if your a person who likes that stuff)

Cons:
-Balance team is pretty horrid.
-This is not a game snipers should be in, they are way to easy to use. They should be harder to use.
-Balance team is pretty horrid.
-Some maps have buggy parts to them that make you wonder how they exist.
-Balance team is pretty horrid.
-Some characters you will immediately hate. (The other 20% like Viktor, snipers, etc)
-Balance team is pretty horrid.
-One dumbass can make you lose the game for any reason. (Pretty unlikely but lame stuff happens)
-Balance team is pretty horrid.
-Certain abilities make no sense on why they are not nerfed.
-Balance team is pretty horrid.
-Random kicks that'll ban you for 5-10 mins. (RARELY)
-Balance team is pretty horrid.
-Grind to unlock all/new characters. (I understand its F2P but $10 CAD for 1 crate seems wack to me. (Crates are for skins)
-Balance team is pretty horrid.

While it seems like they'res lots of cons they're pretty little. Try the game you'll like it. There's a lot more good then bad here, plus the game is still getting quite a bit of updates. Try it. :)"

22337,yes

22347,"I've played paladins on console for years and love playing it. I love being able to move around and use the abilities of my main, Maeve and any of the flanks including vora the newest champion of the realm"
22348,great overwatch copy hahahahahaha (joke)
22349,i love this game but over the years its gotten alot worse in my opinon. Theres to many problems on this game to count or even mention its gotton to the point of unplayable bc of the there servers.
22350,its good
22351,Good diversity of gameplay/style
22352,"This game is very hit or miss. Usually its really fun and addicting, but the developers have a tendency to mess with game mechanics without consulting the community. With buffs, nerfs, and core changes frequently, it can be frustrating sometimes. The matchmaking is also very hit or miss. You'll either be met with a fair and fun matchup or be stuck getting pummeled for 10+ games in a row. I've still played the game for countless hours with friends, and at its peak, Paladins is a top hero shooter.

Edit: Within 24 hours of posting this review, I played a match that made me so angry I gave myself a bloody nose. Matchmaking NEEDS fixed."
22353,"This game is absolute dog shit, and yet, I play it every day."
22354,Good team game.
22355,great game lots of people you can use just all out a great game
22356,"Impossible to not like Paladins. But I still don't get the removal of the third person camera option—that was incredibly dumb. Paladins had a huge advantage over their biggest competitor, and players who supported the game since beta and bought skins were loving it. Still a great game. Just poor decision making...bring third person view back! ""Don't fix what's not broken"""
22357,Worst community. This is worse than league.
22358,it is fun
22359,"The game is fun and has relatively quick rounds, makes for great play."

22405,"I love the game play. I know a lot of people compare it to Overwatch. But it plays in a way all its own. The champions are all diverse, and each match doesn't take too long. I really enjoy playing this with all my friends."
22406,"I've logged 200 hours on Overwatch on console, downloaded this when I bought my PC. It's cool that you can customize your loadouts, I earned coins quickly, but the terrible support killed it for me. I had an issue claiming a free DLC item, I spent over two weeks talking with representatives who did absolutely nothing to resolve my issue. Were accusatory and snide after I waited three or four days for a nonsensical response. Also had a problem with logging INTO my Hi-Rez account, as their proprietary network is garbage. Decent game, but terrible service turns me off of any game."

22443,"There are few issues here and there, bugs and gameplay problems are expected. Just as an example there is a current issue with bounty coins, and HIREZ is removing earned skins and bounty coins. Hope they can fix the issue because it's really a bummer to play a game that removes your items due to technical issues."
22444,Amazing!

22448,its ok
22449,"This game is insanely fun and i know everyone says its an overwatch rip-off but honestly i dont see this game as an overwatch kinda game. the way you have to play each round is totally different and the loadouts are such a great idea. 100% much better whan playing with friends and before you say its bad, play a few games on different champs :)"
22450,Cool game
22451,"[h1] It was a good, until it got killed by it's own creators [/h1]

I, personally, has a mixed feelings about this game. It was a nice game with developers actually care for the community. 

[b] Bugs: [/b]
Of course any games have bugs, however the bugs in this game seem to almost never get fixed. They promised to fix them, but instead they removed some good features in order to ""fix those bugs"", ironically creating more bugs in the process and not fixing any. 

[b] Lack of content: [/b]
Some battle pass themes are cool but the content are bad due to skins only for famous characters, somewhat badly-made and not fitting to the characters at all. The battle passes seems to be rushed in a way and they're only a few weeks long.
Since 2018, they stopped making events for the players, so basically it's just Siege, Team Deathmatch, Objective and Ranked (basically Siege but more pressure). It'd be unfair to compare, but back in the beta version, there were many cool events with good lore for new characters.

[b] Characters: [/b]
To be honest, the characters are cool with their own skills, lores and interactions with specific characters. Some characters' abilities are cool but can be sometimes unbalanced, thus being requested by many players to nerf or remove. There are some old characters from beta that ""died"" because the dev don't want to add any more content to them and instead they give those contents to the ""more popular"" characters.

[b] Community: [/b]
The community is somewhat nice, better than Overwatch's in a way or two. In Ranked you can find people who make tactics to their team, trolls that don't want to cooperate, salty people, toxic people who will try to destroy you and your life etc. The same goes to normal matches.

[b] My opinions: [/b]
A good game for people who like hero-shooting type games. Recommend to play with friends instead of alone.

[spoiler] I enjoyed the game, call me weak but the lack of contents and community make it harder to play. The game would be better if their developers care for it like the Smite team, who actually fixing stuffs and adding good battle pass themes. [/spoiler]"

22457,"ehh, pretty ez"
22458,Love the game and I hope they are working on a new release.
22459,"This game is fun in very very short stints. The whole feel is ""unpolished"" ""clunky"". The UI is a shitshow, bugs glitches and things popping up all the time to try and make you buy jems. If you do ever find a match after waiting 5 mins + you will not have fun. Again the clunky UI means you have no idea where you are taking damage from and some champions are outright not fair... I guess you cant expect too much balance in a free to play. My advice = Go on CD KEYS and buy OVERWATCH save yourself the pain :)"

22466,"I like it, just wish it wasn't so money hungry, but what can you do for a dying game..."
22467,Good Game
22468,"i can't believe that a game which once was just there to copy overwatch is now 10 times more fun than overwatch. even the settings are better, how the fuck are people supposed to use joy sticks without aim assist? that is just plainly not possible since joy sticks are way harder to control compared to mouse. paladins has that, yet overwatch has the option to play with a controller yet they don't let you use aim assist for some reason and you are instantly drop from platinum to gold cuz you cant aim for shit with a joystick. other than that the variety in champions and how they play out in game with how many cards you are given is waaaaay better than heroes in overwatch that are either strong cuz they have mobility or bad cuz they are literally immobile and are free to get shot without fucking moving (looking at you Bastion) though i have seen some overwatch 2 gameplay and if they are adding the level up system then you can just scrap my last point since it won't be relevant in the next year or two. literally the only thing overwatch does better than paladins is the workshop, all i can say is that it's fantastic. other than that paladins does everything else better than overwatch in the system, in gameplay, and in champions. which is the actual point of the game."

cazoo kid"
22475,"This review is long overdue. This game is actually really really good. If you like Overwatch but want to take some time from it, this game is for you. Its different and refreshing to play. Word of warning though, you don't have every champion unlocked on the get go. However if you dont mind having to grind for the champion you want, which i definitely dont, then i definitely recommend this game"
22476,"[I have this game on the Switch so I do have many, many hours on it.]

Many criticise this game for being an Overwatch clone, however, as this game is free I would in fact say that this game is better than Overwatch. It's a blast to play with friends! If you have none, then it can still be an enjoyable experience! If you get randomly matched with a bad team then it can be a bit tedious as it grinds away at your sanity as you cry out for your frontline as they sit back as the overtime meter runs out. The diverse cast of characters gives you unlimited play styles and strategies! It can be a bit glitchy (or annoying when your main gets nerfed) but I would highly reccomend giving it a try if you have some spare time. 

10/10 for a free game!"

22531,its fun but you get almost no gold if you dont pay money and you really need gold
22532,The first time i played this game was on 2018. I really enjoyed the game and i would play everyday.However i took a 1 and a half year break and now i continue to play. I was sad when i realised top plays were removed from the game and that still some bugs were in the game after 2 years. Overall its a great game.
22533,It is a free overwatch with unique abilities and weapons combination on heroes.
22534,OK!
22535,"Good game, pretty close to Overwatch gameplay wise, but a lot slower imo and a lot less mechanicaly challenging. The loadout system really helps spicen things up in the game. The only really bad thing about this game is that it is really buggy, but as long as you overlook that, great game. But seriously the amount of bugs are really noticable sometimes"
22536,I would say its really fun tbh.

22546,"Honestly this game has potential, however it is really buggy with the netcode being so bad that it makes Nintendo's online service look good. The game would be fun if there weren't so many bugs and issues with the connection. But all the executives at Hi-rez care about is turning a profit off of the game, so instead of letting the developers focus on bug fixing, they instead are forced to make cosmetics for a battle pass, and have to program a new champion to slap on the cover. The game can be surprisingly fun being more than just a poor-mans overwatch with a healthy amount of unique mechanics and champions. But the issues with it probably will never be fixed all because the mistakes at hi-rez keep making bad decisions like plenty of micro-transactions, all they focus on is money, and i don't see any of these issues being fixed in the future, which is why i can't recommend this game to anyone because it is currently lying on its death bed"

22554,jkfgufgyv
22555,"Very fun hero shooter, even better with friends."
22556,Really fun. I like it better than overwatch because of the card loadout system. more customization
22557,"Its really ok ig, fun to play with a friend group. But if you are really looking for a game like this and are willing to spend some money on it, get overwatch or even league of legends if you like mobas. Agian its ok for how much money it costs (0.00$) but nothing to get excited over. Players are trash and easy to beat. The game really wants you to spend money and the menu is just a poor copy of league of legends. Tbh, its just league of legends first person mode. Fun for a bit untill you realize its a bad game."
22558,if everyone is op no one is op - hi rez studios
22559,Fun team based game but can be toxic
22560,"When hearing about this game, the first thing that comes to mind is OW clone. I love both games and next are 3 reasons why you should try Paladins:
1. Champion customization: You can create up to 5 different loadouts, modifying the champion abilities.
For example, you can play a healer as a flank (Pip) or a flank as a healer (Moji). And given the right situation, hybrid playstyles are actually in the meta.
2. In-game Item shop: You earn “Credits” by kills, objective time, assists, healing, shielding. With Credits, you can buy items that counter the enemy playstyles.
For example Wrecker is an item that gives bonus dmg to shields, Resilience reduces the effects of slows and stuns.
3. Balanced game mode: Siege is the main game mode and personally it’s the main reason I love Paladins. How many times have you felt hopeless after a defend or attack round in OW, TF2 or Dirty Bomb? In Siege, you have a chance to win till the last overtime.

The objective is taking control of the “Capture Point” by standing on it. Once it’s captured, a payload spawns and the score changes from 0-0 to 1-0 for the team that capped the point.
The team in the lead has to escort the payload into the enemy base before the 2:30 minutes mark. A successful payload push would give another point to the leading team, making the score 2-0. A successful defense from the losing team would equalize the score (1-1). First team reaching 4 points wins, and you can’t earn the fourth score by defending, but only by capturing the point or pushing the payload.

You could say: “But if I’m losing 2-0, I practically lost!” And you wouldn’t be more wrong. The team with the score disadvantage captures the point with a faster rate, meaning you have to stay less time on the point to cap it.

The fight is never over until the last fight, and this is why I love this game"
22561,fun but it is quite repetitive unless you are willing to play characters or use cards you don't often use. Matchmaking can sometimes decide to go on holiday and the game is incredibly buggy. I have near constant crashes when playing this game. I understand that the they have a lot to fix and release but it is still a complain
22562,it's okay
22563,fun game
22564,"This is a gem of a game. It offers fast gameplay and most of all, champion ability customizations with a card loadout system and itemization. The game also has cross-platform play now. You can play with PC, Xbox, PlayStation and Switch players in the same match. You can change this in the settings.

Each champion has 4 or more abilities plus an ultimate ability that has to charge up over time. Rate of charge is dependent on how you play. There are 4 cards to customize each ability and there are 4 more cards to add more utility to your champion. 5 Cards can be added to a loadout and each card can be upgraded in its ability for up to five points. Each loadout has 15 points max to use. You can build your champion the way you want to play and experiment on different loadouts. 

There are items to be purchased during a match using credits earned during a match. All champions have access to these items and choosing a certain item in a certain scenario can tip the match into your team's favour. This adds another level to the game. 

There are bad things about this game as well. Bugs are a major issue that plague the game. If you are a casual player then it is easy to overlook. Champion balance is an issue as well but with a game that is this customizable, it is too be expected. The matchmaking is poor depending on the server you are playing on. 

So if you are looking for fast pace casual gaming experience with ""play it your way"" champions then this is a definite pickup for a fun time. Though, don't blame the developers if you get addicted

This for me is a game breaking bug which seems to have popped up in forums since 2017.... I'll be uninstalling it since not being able to play every 3rd-4th game due to a bug is just ridiculous."

22594,"In many ways, this game is better than OW.
In many ways, it is not. 
It is basically the MOBA of first person shooters, with some OW ingridients mixed in. 
Try it out, play some games, maybe you like this game more than OW. 
"
22595,it is a very good game you should try it out
22596,"This game is really fun
"
22597,"It's hard not to compare this game to Overwatch, as it's obviously a clone with an extra layer. If you're looking for Overwatch with a little extra depth in character playstyle, this'll scratch the itch.

Each character has a loadout that allows them to invest points into up to 5 perks (decreased cooldown on an ability, increased hp, movespeed buffs, etc.) and they can invest 15 points per loadout. So basically, you can buff one of your abilities to be super strong, or tweak some numbers to suit your playstyle. Cool concept.

There's also in-game item builds. The builds are super simple, which I appreciate. If you're familiar with mobas, this'll be really easy to pick up. It's stuff like ""increased cooldown reduction"" or ""dmg reduces enemy healing"". 4 skills per category (tank, dmg, cooldown, heal), so 16 items total.

The games are steamrolly at first, but seem to get better as you play more. Though I still see some players not buying items at all, which really hurts some matches.

Overall, would recommend! It's free. It's fun."
22598,"Yeah, it's buggy, it's unbalanced, it has lots of room for improvement, it's a mess, but it's OUR mess. Honestly, for what it's worth (which is $0 if you don't make in-game purchases), it's a great alternative to Overwatch. Great community. Definitely still has its toxic players, but it's a lot less toxic than other FPS games that I've seen. Great game."

22656,good game
22657,"This Game has evolved so much over the years. In a positive way.
It has so many amazing champs at this point with really unique abilities.
The Card and the ingame perks system really make it stand out over overwatch.

Of course it can not compete with it completely graphicwise but even if the graphic does not look realistic af or 4k it has a unique charm to it and in no way looks bad.

The skins in this game also are fucking incredible. There is such a big amount of amazing skins to get for your champ its crazy. 

The developers in recent seasons have been very interactive with the community which means:
- (actually not broken) balance changes and several great updates
- twitch drops!!
- maps/map reworks
- slight champ reworks
- new skins
- battlepass (game is free so..)
- new free loot through a trials section every season
- new champs every season (looking at you Overwatch)
- A lot of timed modes which can be a lot of fun as they sometimes are absolutely ridicoulus ideas such as everybody plays the same champ with insanely short ultimate charges.

Of course there are also some negative points which mostly come from a ever slightly declining player base though:
- missing players (main problem) which leads to long que times for ranked (and overall missing practice in ranked) as most players play casual matchs. 
This leads to occasionally very unbalanced matchmaking as almost maxed out players with thousands of hours will play casual against total beginners as they dont want to wait that long to play ranked.
- Ranked could use more rewards although when you look at games such as apex it defenitely has more rewards 
- A new standard mode would be amazing but yeah its an overwatch game so I dont really expect more to come to it other than the existing modes which btw are:

Push the payload
TDM
Capture the point
Ranked Mode (Push the Payload with Champion Bans)
Shooting range
Tutorials for each mode
Custom matches
Limited time modes

All in all this game is a lot of fun and defenitely worth playing. This Game is of course similar to Overwatch but in no way is it a clone. It absolutely has a lot of advantages and some disadvantages. 
I mean.. ""ITS FREE"" .. what do you have to lose?"

22707,GREAT GAME
22708,yes yes very yes good
22709,"Yes, I have 181 hours in this game. Yes, I enjoy this game. No, I definitely cannot recommend it as it remains one of the buggiest games in my Steam library. What is the point of leveling a Battle Pass and unlocking things if all of those unlocks force me to close the game after I get stuck on a ""claim item"" loop? Not to mention the constant disconnects, bounty store issues, etc. Honestly, there are far too many bugs to count, and in most games I would consider them unplayable, but I deal with them in this game for god knows what reason."
22710,"Absolutely fantastic game, the champion customization cards, the skins, the teamwork, the smoothness, the variety.  Different game every time.  Seige is the best game mode.  Sometimes there are aimbotters, which ruins the balance of the game, which is overall quite good.  Some champions seem OP sometimes, but there is a counter to everything.  Community is for the most part really fun and positive, every once in a while you get a grumpy baby but hey everyone gets grumpy sometimes.  The personalities of the champions and the voice packs are also loads of fun, including the standard ones.  I have laughed out loud many many times from the banter we get going with these.  I wasn't going to buy anything, but then I loved the game so much that I wanted to donate, and I figured hey might as well get a skin out of it too.  Currently saving up for more."

22720,"compared to smite and other hero fps this game is absolute garbage. for a long time i had to play with bots that had fake names to make me think i was playing with other player, then threw me agents high lvl players with teammates are worst than the bots. the game is free but not worth my and your time. for those who don't know this game will force you to fight with and against bots for the first 10 lvl then you have to go through the worst matching that c.o.d. still uses. you will be put against high lvl players while you are trying to lvl a hero/champion and learn about them. yes this better than overwatch but anything is better than that trash."

22725,"What kind of useless game is this? Me and two other friends are new player, but we keep been matchmaking with hardcore high level player. Stupid game ever. Worst then MLBB. Developer worst then moonton."
22726,swag
22727,"Despite the game being riddled with bugs (sometimes game-breaking), the customisation given through the Card, Talent and Item systems give the game a distinct edge gameplay-wise over other hero shooters like Overwatch. This great gameplay is pretty much the only reason to play this game, along with fact that it's free.

Along with my time on PC - I've played over 200 hours on Switch. From this time spent playing, the biggest problem I've come across is the excessive number of bugs (many of which have been around for years) and how unstable the game can be. The Switch version kept crashing every 20 minutes and the PC version also crashes occasionally which can make playing ranked risky. But only if you find a ranked match in the first place. Ranked matches often take 20+ minutes to find, ranked lobbies are very toxic and there are barely any rewards for playing ranked.
Characters are badly balanced and most of the new maps are badly designed. TDM is a broken mode where you often respawn right next to the player who killed you. The publishers are greedy (although the game isn't pay to win thankfully) and the developers are questionable.

To summarise, good gameplay but the rest of the game could be better. Because it's free, it's worth checking out for the gameplay alone."

22770,"Just an amazing game, it's very fun and very easy to take on.
No need to be an crack of the aim to enjoy it, just launch the game and enjoy.
A small computer can run it easily."
22771,"The the game is fairly fun and very open to new players. Though it is plagued by some very annoying glitches and bugs that range from, an annoying noise being played at max volume endlessly, to not being able to fire your gun, or just straight up not allowing a team to win despite meeting the winning requirements.

Another glaring issue with the game, is the lack of skillbased matchmaking while in Ranked mode. The game does not put you up aganist opponents of a simular rank, nor does it fill your team with a same rank. More often than not, the game will put up 5 bronze players up aganist 5 platinum players. 

When these glitches happen they really put a damper on the mood, and if these glitches were to be patched out, I think this game would be able to grow a lot more.

P.s. I know this is a steam review, but please do not play this game on console. On every console I've tried it on, the game full on crashes every 5 games for no apparent reason."
22772,"игра ужасно лагает и лагает не только у меня или у игроков с моей ""локации"", лагает вообще практически у всех.
каждый день обновления, которые мешают игре и тоже являются причинами багов и порчи игры! играть нормально не возможно просто из-за г*нд*н*в разработчиков! 
Пожалуйста, перестаньте добавлять никому ненужных обсосанных придурков в игру или добавлять на каждую карту по цветку (типа обновление в игре). Оставьте как есть и живите спокойно!!!

22815,"Paladins, well its something its a bit of a cluster of mess that's somehow held together with spit and sticks. Now I know that sounds kinda brutal, but it has to be for this game, The game is good maybe. The best thing about paladins is the card system, It brings so many variation to a champion. Though it has a lot of bad, no its not as toxic as league of legends, and no its not as over saturated as the 100 battle royals by now, Its a little buggy but the worst problem is really the game itself. The game is overly easy, which is good for new players but if your looking for a challenge like a real challenge, you wont find it her though some champions do take skill some don't... but I can say that if you just wanna have some fun with hero's that almost never get boring then at least try paladins."

22841,"The devs don't know how to balance their fucking game and they only listen to the over paid and brain dead ""MlG pRoS"" rather than the actual player base. Hi-Rez pumps out the most ever powered characters just about every update and they nerf every character that requires a working brain and an IQ above 50 to use, not to mention some characters have bugs and glitches SINCE RELEASE that have never been addressed such as Andro's REVERSE ABILITY when people can somehow shoot through it. The community is toxic as hell enough to the point it makes CoD look like a christian game, you will find the most smugged and thin skinned players in Paladins who will play broken characters like Dredge, Strix, Ash, Buck, Koga, and Talus, because if they play a character that takes a brain to use they'll get curb stomped so they gotta find cheap wins. HEALERS are broken, Hi-Rez just nerfed some of the healers and as a result the community started playing TWO HEALERS and with two healers a tank becomes unkillable. TANKS in this game do too much fucking damage, when an Ash can 1v1 and destroy flank users, damage dealers, and other tanks there's a fucking problem with the tanks with the only balanced two being a TURTLE and a Knight with a flamethrower........  HI-REZ... GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER, LEARN TO BALANCE YOUR GAME, AND FIRE THE IDIOTS IN CHARGE OF THE GAME BALANCING......."
22842,poopy
22843,"For a free to play game, Paladins offers much to someone looking to pick up a free-to-play game and settle down with it. Offering a wide variety of different play styles to players with new champions coming out annually. But like most free-to-play titles, Paladins falls short with it's trauma inducing and grindy game play, with only 3 official modes and a little over 10 maps it can be hard to play Public matches and really enjoy the game. The grind filled game play of course has a way to progress faster with gems, also known as micro transactions. These can be used to buy skins, emotes, champions and more. Just gotta hand them your wallet. All in all Paladins is a fun game with friends and at it's core great if you can look past the micro transactions and the grinding."

22861,I enjoyed playing this game. Much better with friends tho
22862,good game
22863,if you want to save a buck and have fun with bugs. come down to paladins. where roaches are everywhere and some skins make you want to take the dev's money to get paid for seeing that shit.

22915,"Pretty fun, very innovative, mechanics are nice and I love Talus to the core of my being. IIIIII do have speculations on the movement animatics and the UBER smoothness of the abilities...I'd like feeling to my gameplay as every champion not blank slate tapping and hitbox pinging... It doesn't really feel like some games do when it comes to its mechanics' features rather it makes you feel like you're in a cookie cutter. I would like to see some quality animations as if I were playing a shooter like overwatch or a moba like league."

22948,free overwatch
22949,"honestly, in the short amount of time that i have played, i have found myself almost fully engrossed in the fast-paced team battle action, and often constantly screaming at my friends for help, which only makes the game more fun. there's an array of characters to choose from, and each one appealing to a different type of player. if you're comfortable with fps games, and used to tactical shooters, you might find yourself playing more Viktor. there's a lot to this game that makes it appealing, and i think that's what makes it so special."

22955,"+ Game is dynamic and addicting, each match is different its almost impossible to feel like you are fighting against and with the same players.
+ There is ton of champions all of them have ""Talents"" and ""Cards"" which hugely increases lots of playstyles suited for any one.
+ Not Pay2Win
+ Skins are high quality and changes their entire voice lines according to the theme of the skin( I haven't seen another game do this ).
+ it's very much possible to get tons of fr-ee ski-ns, you can grind crystals for the free track of 1 battle pass and the next you will be able to buy the battlepass and It will give you enough to get the next. Also there is a currency called bounty coins you can do daily quests to get gold and bounty coins which you can use to buy skins which go on a rotation every 2 days.
+ Tons of waifus to choose from.
+ Really easy to run, if you have a 7 year old or older PC your PC can run this. I have a 7 year old PC with a GTX 670 and run this with maximum graphics at a resolution scale of 120. Get consistent 120+fps.
+ You can really enjoy this game if you play casually, but before you do there is no shame in watching a paladins guide.

- sh-it servers, I play on consistent 47 ping which isn't bad, but sometimes it feels like its one 110. Champions that are projectile based get hit harder.
- sh-it tutorial, basically teaches you how to shoot and run.
- sh-it matchmaking pairs you up with people who barely know about the game against experienced players. This causes lots of frustration and sadness for new players and old.
- Takes a long time to unlock every champion.
- Toxic community, they sh-it on new players and old. Sometimes they do badly as well which is funny.

Even though you heard all these points I would highly advise to check the game for yourself. and START PLAYING WITH PLAYING THE MOST FAVORITE CHAMPION YOU THINK IS INTERESTING AND FUN THE MOST. Not only would this make your experience much better, but you would have tons of fun playing your favorite champion."

23001,"Keep in mind I last played when corvus or whatever was the new guy.

Its a decent enough game, if you can't be bothered to learn other games or you don't want to buy overwatch this is a alright choice. Its learning curve to play well is quite low although from what I could tell learning the meta game really boosts you up a notch so the customisation that can be done is sort of pointless and in the end goes for only a handful of great builds and when the majority uses the meta builds playing something wacky is kinda depressing. Last I played it some champions still needed to be balanced to be less noob friendly at least and others maybe a tap more into the Buff zone. There is still an active enough player base to find games relatively quick to load into even if the player base is dropping (If steam charts is to be trusted) there are still quite some years to play the game before death. The visuals are acceptable although don't have anything quite unique going for them and really does make it look like a free to play game although it will run on a potato to make up for it. In conclusion if you don't want something too hard to get into I could see this being a good choice, although id regret not saying give tf2 a proper try its a higher learning curve and bot issues but its well worth the learning."
23002,it is  fun i have not played it that long but i recomend it
23003,Its a fun game if you like overwatch and games like that
23004,"I liked the gameplay and graphics
"
23005,rather like overwatch but with more options.
23006,Its a free game with some fun modes i've enjoyed this game since beta days on console and now have the pleasure of playing it here on steam. If you are trying to get anywhere competetively or win nonstop etc do the obvious and download discord and find a squad that simple. The biggest issue with this game and others like it is the fact that people will jump ship for not single handedly carrying or winning every match the big magical trick is to find people you vibe with and squad up its not that hard. Now get out there into the realm!
23007,oreo paixnidi

23013,"It's not that the game is perfect or anything but the sheer amount of game play potential captures all of us friends into playing this game again and again. Combined, all of our friends have almost over 1500 hours in this game and that's paladins for you. It make you go for something further and further till you hope it just didn't exist. And yes, don't worry about the bugs it might never get removed even if Hi Rez contacts you personally. By the way, I will still give it a 5 stars because it's just like my toxic ex, whom I loved so much, for whose fault I started playing this game.
Hope you enjoy destroying your life by playing this game to utter extinction."

23020,"I have played this game quite a bit in the past. It's simple enough. Paladins has lots of good characters to choose from and I had a lot of fun playing this game, but one day I just got so frustrated with this game that I never picked it up again. It wasn't just that one time either, everyone I knew was consistently having server problems. There were frequent bugs and glitches. Game breaking ones where I couldn't use any abilities and couldn't see my horse. Paladins is a game that has been out for a while now, but one that still acts as if it is in the beta stage.The queuing system in this game is broken as well. You don't queue for a certain role, so I've been on teams with five supports. The ranked system is annoying as well because your rank is determined by win or lose, so if you can't carry the other randoms to victory, you're going to be stuck. The most disappointing part is that none of this has ever been fixed. I say this because it makes me upset that a game I enjoyed had bugs so bad that one day I put the game down and never seriously played it again. Also, the furries...too many furries. Overall, do I recommend it? I really wish I could say yes, but I just feel as though there are better games to play instead, ahem* Overwatch. I'm serious I know this game is free and people argue they're just different, but as someone who was actually pulling for Paladins in the beginning, I can now tell you, just play Overwatch. This advice will save you a lot of time and pain, trust me."

23023,"If anyone wants any good show recommendations, Ninjago is a very good show. It's a show about 4 Ninja; Kai, Cole, Zane, Jay, and their sensei Wu. They're all different elements which correspond to the color of their outfits. Fire, Earth, Ice, and Lightning. In it the 4 ninjas find out there's a chosen ninja called the green ninja and each of them think that they're the green ninja. That's not all though. They're main goal is to beat Lord Garmadon, Sensei Wu's brother who became evil after being bitten by the great devourer when he was young. Lord Garmadons son; Lloyd Garmadon releases the serpentine back into the world and the ninja have to try and defeat them too. The point is it's a amazing show with an amazing plot and I think you guys should watch it."

23027,Good with friends! Other than issues with certain characters(Usually the newer ones) being OP but Hi-Rez listens to their community and often make corrections based on criticism.

23034,"It's pretty fun. There are a lot of champions to choose from (although at any one time you're limited to the small selection that are either free-to-play or which you've bought). 

The cards and upgrade systems add a lot of variety to the way that you can play any particular champ, meaning they can feel very different (a low-health champ can become quite a self-healer with the right setup).

The champs are easy enough to play, the aiming is relatively forgiving, and overall they feel good. 

Plus the game is free!

23042,"Every match is filled with at least 1-2 AFK bots which is a sign of a dead game. All I encounter are bots hopping at spawn, running around in circles and their item loadouts are vastly empty. You can't even see other player's connections to see how bad their pingrates are. The matchmaking is atrocious and even worse than Overwatch. It was fun for a time but this major problem completely overshadows it.

This company hasn't changed at all since 2016 and they have had more than enough time to fix these issues. I had no choice but to spend $10 (on special instead of the initial $30) to unlock all of the champions which makes up of 90% of the roster and it is an absolute grindfest as you have to unlock 1 ability for every champion which is locked for some reason? Retarded. There are more champions than necessary and should work on balance changes instead. Vora is everything wrong with the champion game design and why they need to stop.

This game will never be an eSport and frankly never will catering to filthy casuals. It's a self-deprecating example that game companies never listen to the professional community and why Hi-Rez is notorious for their poor business practices. They're like EA and Blizzard but inferior without any of the ability to flaunt their wealth. I've already played this game under a different account when it first came out. I came back only to see that nothing has changed and will remain that way."

Still fun though and that's about it."
23045,its very fun
23046,good
23047,"I started this game rather early back when Cassie (one of the champion) still uses longbow and Ruckus still have the fancy skin. I stopped playing, then I played it again. Many has changed from skins development, to the micro-transaction. Is the game worth it to play? to me yes, because its free and doesnt take much of storage. Require some grind to get all the champions but if you're lucky you can get over 50% off for the champion pack so you wont have to grind again. However, to me buying the champions pack removes my purpose of playing the game, because usually, i played the game so i can enjoy new champions played it until its level 15 or something and move on to the next one.

Overall, a good game with good gameplay, have its glitches although not to often but when it does its annoying."

23107,"Ah, Paladins. They called you an Overwatch clone but you stood the test of time and are still going strong while OW is just an embarrassment. You've evolved into a unique experience unlike anything else on the market.

Despite what the number above might say I have been in the Realm since Closed Beta and have over 500+ hours in this game. 
TL:DR - its a very very fun shooter and you should definitely play it.

Long version since I have a lot to say:

Pros:
-very fast paced nuts to buts gameplay, tons of fun. Also as soon as the gates open, the action is non-stop until the round ends. There's basically no downtime.
-the Champions are all super cool, fun and interesting but simple and easy to pick up. They also vary a lot by playstyle and strategy, so you're bound to find someone you enjoy
-maps are quite well made, keep the flow of combat going nicely
-healthy playerbase, in EU i can consistently get a match in under a minute
-the Loadout+Talent system is fantastic, it lets you customize and min-max your Champion to fit you better and to optimize them in combat
-the lore they've built over the years is surprisingly good
-a lot of battle passes, quests, events and cosmetics to work on and collect if you care about that. In other words, there's always something to do

Cons:
-Bugs. Lots of Bugs. Luckily rarely so bad that it makes the game unplayable, but glitches and bugs are part and parcel of this game, always have been. The devs do a lot of work to fix them and bugs most of the time don't stick around too long, but new ones just keep popping up.
-Because of said bugs, some cool and useful features like the Death Cam and Play of the Game had to be removed since they caused so many bugs that they just had to be axed, since the underlying code itself was broken (the devs admitted this themselves)
-The average people you will get matched with tend to suck. Matchmaking is good, that's just how the playerbase always has been. It's a very teamwork reliant game, what do you expect? The community isn't toxic per se, but it's not the best and has its issues
-Some people can be toxic af, but what else is new? This applies to basically every multiplayer game like this
-Personal opinion, but the graphics could use improvement. The artstyle itself is fantastic but the textures, shadows and all the like look a bit dated. At least the ability effects look nice
-I miss old Torvald :(

Conclusion:

Paladins isn't the prettiest game and bugs can be frequent, but it's amazing gameplay is it's saving grace. I strongly recommend you give it a shot, if you like fast paced action, you will love this game. Just remember: pick Supp and Front Line when the team needs it, stay on the objective and buy Cauterize."
23108,i want skye to step on me
23109,.
23110,good game buggy game terrible ranked system but when it works its a good game
23111,"Great game 
"
23112,"Ah, now this takes me back. When Paladins first came out, it was a bit before the battle royal craze had really kicked into full gear in popularity, and games like Team Fortress and Overwatch were all the rage. Then Paladins came out. We the players loved it; heck, there were OW and TF fans who enjoyed it too. But the drama that dominated the net for the next year or to was 'blah blah this is such a copy of OW!'. I eventually got bored of TF back in the day, and no doubt I would have gotten bored of OW had I played it long enough for the same reasons. Paladins instantly solved the issues I had with both games (TF and OW) and I never looked back since. Yeah the company Hi Rez have made a few oopsies here and there but they seem to always come full circle and listen to the good feedback (as opposed to other devs listening to someone just because their the most obnoxious/loud). 

Between the card system (good to see it back to normal), the talents, the revised battle modes and the ever increasing number of champions to choose from and you have a real winner on your hands that will most likely be around for years to come (here's to hoping). Both OW and TF grew incredibly stale for the very reasons Paladins has not and that innovation to keep the strategic layer of things interesting and influential on the tactical level is a game changer. 

The champions are very different to each other and how they work so I'm sure most of you will be able to find at least one that fits your play style. I was lucky enough to purchase the founders pack (no longer available) way back when so I can jump around a lot, but the same time if I had joined later post founder-pack I can tell you that the grind to unlock new champs is worth it. Just check out a few youtubes to find a champ that gels with you.

The only difference? They removed third person mode. The only thing that makes it worth it to spend some money to buy new costumes. As far as i can tell, The TPS mode only bothers competitive players, Which is why they disabled it in ranked mode (To prevent peeking), But they still enable it in the Casual mode, which is great. But Now, they removed it entirely for some reason.

Don't get me wrong the game is great. But for me third person mode is a way for me to play the game longer, Since FPS games tend to make me nauseous after 1 or 2 matches...

I hope they'll bring back the TPS Toggle button back in the future...."

23154,"I have absolutely no good memories of this game. 0. I stopped playing a long time ago, but my friends still play and it's always a game of ""how long until they rage"" and I hate it. I hate this game with a burning passion, and I have absolutely sworn it off. I last played it TWO YEARS AGO, and I have not touched it since. This game is a burning pile of garbage, and I've heard it's only gotten worse.
--
EDIT:
It's been requested that I add that one of my friend has 2.5k hours. 2.5 THOUSAND. And it's been a game of ""how long until they rage"" as long as I can remember. Can not condemn this game more. Again, it's a burning pile of garbage, and apparently getting worse. There's a reason I've played so little."

It clearly rips off overwatch and ruins all the character designs. The gunplay is really bad and the controls always felt stiff. The game can definetly be pay to win because of the terrible character balancing. There are very few things that make this game appealing other than the fact that it's free and crossplatform.

Edit: Played it again, solid groundwork that has slowly been built over with bullshit characters, health, damage, speed and pay to win elements."

About technical things game is too buggy and sometimes unplayable servers are usually on fire but its with every other games these days . Devs are working on improving this game by giving good updates  . Its a free to play game so you might think of pay to win or some thing like that , no its does not have pay to win elements but it have in-game purchases like skins and battle passes but u can earn crystals (premium currency) by grinding free track of battle pass and skins by bounty store and u can get bounty store coins by doing daily quests ."

Though this game may have some unfair matching, it's constantly letting itself improve. Making broken things more broken to make it unbroken. I don't know how, but using the words of a mastermind: It Just Works."
23185,"This game is great starting off! But the more and more you play it the more and more it gets boring.  All the characters play the same in a way,  It's just not interesting.  The players of the community are either fun and good to be around or toxic as fuck.  The ranked doesn't feel like ranked when you get silvers on your team in masters.  Play it for a bit with your mates I do not recommend spending money on it."
23186,"The gameplay is fun but unless you're willing to pay, unlocking the characters is a serious grind. Considering the base game is free though you may as well just cough up the $30 because it is a very fun game."

23215,"Played It Before Overwatch Then I Got Overwatch And Really Enjoyed It For A While. After Some Time My Interest In Overwatch Declined, But My Interest In This Game Never Did. Loads Of Hero's To Play Which Geta Expanded Regularly. There Are Ways To Speed Up The Quote ""Grind"" But They Are Totally Optional. Each Character Has A Multitude Of Diffrent Card Sets They Can Utilize That Changes The Way There Abilities Work, Which Means Several Ways To Play A Character And Find The Build That Works Best For You."
23216,"Rly good game pls play it
"
23217,Nice Game
23218,It need more reward it feels boring after you complete quests so i basically feel tired of it after an hour and you could make something new instead of jamming us with boring ass champions every time make a campaign mode or some shit make new game modes. Make this game more interesting. But all in all it has pretty high hopes i hope they do something about it before this game dies...
23219,"I wish I could give a positive review since I have spent way too much time playing this game. It's a shame because the gameplay mechanics and champions can be really fun and rewarding to play and you can change loadouts to fit your preferred playstyle. I love the variety of champions and their unique abilities.

But this game has way too many issues, each patch brings even more bugs, piling on top of thousands of old ones that have never been fixed. The servers are unstable and seem to get slower and more buggy all the time. Random crashes in the middle of the matches, login problems, players running around in t-pose, you name it. They basically have more people employed to create skins than actual developers trying to fix the damn game. Paladins has a lot of potential but all these issues sadly overtake the positive sides and make it very demotivating to play this game."
23220,"This was the first shooter game I picked up. It was really easy to pick up the controls and understand what the characters did without having to test them. The lore behind the characters is absolutely fantastic as well. I really enjoy Seris' and Vora's backstories. A lot of people love to talk about how the champions are ""broken,"" meaning that certain abilities the characters have are overpowered and have an unfair advantage over the collective abilities of the other champions. I find this to be a little unfair for people to say, as almost all characters can be considered ""broken"" in one way or another, which I think makes everyone's abilities on par. I also think it adds another level of strategic game play and skill to take into account. Overall, I think the game and developers deserve a lot more credit than they get. They're developing an entire narrative, multiple backstories to explain each character's abilities, and new characters with skins and emotes on top of a battlepass. Well done."

thank you for fixing servers"
23233,"This game makes me hate myself and the world.

10/10 would feel emotions again"
23234,"This game is a ripoff of Overwatch, so I might as well review Overwatch instead of this knock off garbage.

Overwatch sucks. If you say ANYTHING in-game other than ""gg"" after a match, like if you even say ""hi"" the moronic nerds will report you for ""abusive chat"" and, despite the fact that Blizzard has sidelined making maps worth a damn or more/better tank heroes in order to ban ""toxic"" players, their report system is completely automated and unmanned. So if a party wants to report you for abusive chat because you asked for a shield tank in chat, you're simply screwed.

The only real skill ladder in this game is understanding how ults and ult economy work. It's funny because there are tons of ults like Zarya's gravity pull or Junkrat's tire that can team kill effortlessly and is a great source of frustration for new players, because the game specifically encourages grouping up behind your tanks, only to punish you for it with these sorts of things.

Blizzard has been chasing the comp scene way too hard and for some reason is obsessed with making even the casual mode competitive even though there's no scoreboard in-game and everyone is more than happy to snitch on you like it's friggin Nazi Germany if you attempt coordination. So where's the competitive aspect? Quick play matches are a total mess, around 70% of matches are lopsided and over within 3 minutes because one team has grandmaster players and the other has people that installed an hour ago. 

What boggles my mind is how your average Overwatch player navigates life if anything and everything offends them. I've seen tumblrinas with thicker skin. Where did this term ""toxic players"" come from? I've never heard it outside of Overwatch and especially before its unveiling. It's literally mentioned every time someone brings up the game, as if mute buttons don't exist. You can even blacklist people from your queue if you don't like them. So you have mutes, reports, and blacklists. What more do you people want? An in-game moderator for every match? Grow the fuck up. After some investigation, I've found out like 80% of people that play Overwatch are basement dwelling NEETs who are wannabe e-sports streamers. You know what offends me personally? Losing a game because of bad teammates."

23241,bruh im level 5 but my enemy's level is 250. are you fuckin kidding me right now?
23242,"Idiot people cause you to lose games via no communication, stubborness and ego driven community. To top it off they blame you when you call out their shitty skills although you have more kills and overall better game stats. No its not bitching its merely literally telling people the BEST course of action for each character like a leader (theres a leadship award but people hate when someone is better than them strategically) but seeing as this is western society pride and low self esteem (i;m a failure so i don't let strangers criticize me lest i kill myself) take the forefront and turn constructive criticism into a personal attack. 

I Called out an idiot who picked DPS after there were 2 DPS and no healer. one Flank and one tank. The team literally gets mad at me for asking the guy why did he be selfish and pick a character he wasn't even good with. So i just stood back and let them hold their L. Casual or ranked nobody is playing to LOSE because of your LACK of seriousness. if you don't take it serious then i'll just cause you to lose. Doesn't matter to me. If one leg on the horse doesn't work, break em all in this case.

The game is FUN when you're in a country or server with people who are worth a fuck and don't project their toxicity onto you.

Trolls will call this a ""TOXIC review"" when its literally an analysis of the community but if the shoe fits they'll act as if it DOESN'T PRETAIN to them but start a bandwagon of attacking the poster instead of the message. All in all the point is the community is braindead causing many of me and my friends to go on 13 game losing streaks because someone is trying to quick scope with strix, pick kinessa alongside strix and lower your OVERALL DPS then get mad when you call them out on it."

23285,"Played this in 2017 with no problems, now im getting this
Launch error: failed to start the game"
23286,"This game is a fun competitive fps that has far too many cosmetics one must pay for, as well as the grind to unlock more champions is real."
23287,tdpk?
23288,"It is a decent game, but I've become increasingly frustrated with it.
Some champs can seem broken at times, while other times they seem like punching bags for the other team (of course all depends on player and their loadout). It's hard to see what exactly happened other than the kill report with damage numbers. You're never sure of how they hit you or how fast they were hitting you, or if there was something weird going on.

Then there's the actual broken parts of the game that are noticeable by everyone. The backbone of the game: objectives.
There have been several games now where myself or multiple teammates are in the objective circle and it was not counting us. Especially on payload and we are trying to defend. Makes no sense for this to be broken after all this time.
Hit detection, still an issue. With snipers it can be seen easier than other champs.

Bots are still useless subs for when a player DCs. Half the time they just feed the enemy team without doing anything.
Then there are players that are still learning or play really really bad that make you question if they're bots or not. Wish hi-rez would actually label who is a bot so we know when a player had DCed, but that's just me.

The game has more going for it than Overwatch, but it is still not as polished after all this time.
I rate it a 7/10.
Recommend to, at the very least, try it since it is free to play. Like many team based games (any co-op game really), it preferable to have some friends to play with as randoms can be...difficult...to play with at times.

v--can probably disregard this portion--v
[spoiler]There's a noticeable pattern in my wins/losses that just seems weird to me, but most likely means nothing. I win a game or two, then lose at least five after that, then win a game or two, lose another five or so. With most losses being complete stomps, it really isn't fun to play. Especially when everyone gets their hp melted in seconds right out of spawn, including our tanks.

I don't mind having multiple losses at times, especially when they are close games. It's just no fun when the majority of the games you play, either your team or the other team gets completely shutdown. Dying right out of spawn in seconds basically makes the game unplayable in a sense, since you have to wait another 10-12 seconds to respawn, only to immediately die again.[/spoiler]"

i give this game a 8.5/10
i like the game and the ideas but the weird hit boxes suck and some of the character lost a lot of movement options but led to some cool technique you can do with it. ill let you find that for your self

23383,One of my favorite games Ive experienced as free to play. Its basically Overwatch but less toxic and you dont have to deal with Blizzard. The recent division of the company to create focused designers has improved the game drastically. In addition to the normal play you can use the card system to customize your character builds to further suit your playstyle.
23384,"Garbage, quite literally a dumpster on fire. Don't waste your time and brain cells.
Played this game since early open beta, got into grandmasters several times, bought all battle passes and other cosmetics. But hey, who would have guessed that when developers, who play their own game so rarely they can barely reach gold, decide to try and balance it, they fuck it up? Since the beginning of season 3 (2020), this game has been utter shit. Terrible balance decisions, servers aren't working properly, the bugs that exist since 2016 are still here, in game. It's a rule of thumb: if developers don't play the game, they can't fix it. Maybe they should stop wanking off to Maeve and actually try their own game out, but I'm no expert.
Quitted this garbage in January due to bad servers. Decided to download it now, and guess what? Yeah, servers are now even worse. But what did I even expect?"
23385,I'm Grover
23386,It can feel a lot Like... Overwatch...and that's a good thing about this game! It's got its fair share of bugs but it has a lot of maps and playing this with your friends feel amazing!! Would recommend fellow gamers who are looking for something lite or have friends with not so beefy computers but have the skill to game...or if ur just looking to burn some time smashing Noobs..the powers and characters Available are a lot!!
23387,Do you want to buy a new table every few weeks? Do you love tohurt your hands? If yes this game is for you! Try out Paladins Champions of the Realm now for FREE!!!
23388,"Idk, its a FREE game with character with different skills
You can buy all the characters or use the weekly free character to see if you want to unlock them. You can also unlock them by playing but... it's a grind for dayz, not worth it for one character
There's modes (TDM) (King of the Hill -type) and Escort the payload
You can also play against bots and level up, it's fun because you just destroy but it's slower
A recommendation because it's FREE"
23389,"this game is dogshit, 10/10"
23390,Awesome and fun
23391,good clicks
23392,"i like this paladins game so much as it comes out with a good different champions as well as their skills too, every champions has its own skills and what is the most exciting about this game is you need to learn and get some training first before playing the champion chosen as their skills are completely different. what i dislike about this game is the pin is always high and lag, and i know it is not because of my internet connection but paladins always got my nerve as it always lag out of nowhere but yeah i enjoy playing this game so much!"
23393,Nice game i like play this game

23409,"Paladins 2020 experience was like (1.5k hours) :-

Get a matched with new players in your team and the opponents are often Mastet/GrandM :')

The skin you like the most or want is locked behind an pay wall :')

Playing on sea/eu servers in 2020 you might lose your brain cells.( Packet loss made the game unplayable for many weeks) 


Comp experience (Tips and tricks)

Don't play comp if you rage alot .  I REPEAT DON'T.

5th/4th pick player will always pick against you so be prepared. They will make sure you lose so from the start count them with your opponents.

There are still Teammates who will pick for the team but those are very rare species. So just say thank you to them.

You might get matched with masters / grandmasters. And if you do get matched with them the match will be hopeless but don't give up trying.

Also if you want to avoid some these you can queue in an party.

Would recommend it 100% if you want more salt in your life."
23410,meh
23411,Pretty enjoing it!
23412,"I used to love playing this game and even with trying various things like replacing files it says one of the anti cheat files with my fire wall isn't trusted yet I can't find it anywhere in my windows32, so i'm uninstalling it now after putting in almost 20 hours. it wasn't a lot sure, but I was looking forward to a lot more then that and it's sad I can't,"
23413,Fun
23414,MHMHM
23415,it's good
23416,"This is a pretty fun moba. Like most mobas you gotta spend actual money to unlock skins or characters, but you can do long grinds to unlock everything manually.  The gameplay is pretty fast paced and fun, I actually prefer this to overwatch, even if the graphics and character designs are not as well fleshed out."
23417,"Whoever says that Paladins is a cheap knock-off of Overwatch is clearly biased and doesn't know what he's talking about. They of course share some similarities being both the same genre, but they play in a totally different way."

23426,"Game is great, been playing it for years and I see it kinda as the poor man's Overwatch. 

But I'm deleting it now; the game ha been constantly laggy, with microstutters, random fps drops, and ofc potato servers. It used to run (somewhat) smoothly before but it's been months now and I'm losing hope that it's performance will improve.

+ Great game
- Ruined by poor optimization"
23427,Great game but often have buggy issues
23428,"The only thing fun about this game is Onslaught. 

You only need to play Bomb King and you can demolish the other team.

Thanks to cross platform play, and the amount of shitty players there are it's really easy to just chill out and get some frags.

Half of the player base on casuals can't even utilise their picked champions, and just end up losing the game of rock, papers, scissors.

If you have a friend who understands the mechanics of Paladins, and is skilled, then you can form a 2 man party and play rank. 

Rank gets harder as you progress, since there are really good players who understand team comp and how the game mechanics function.

In conclusion: if you're a casual gamer, onslaught is for you. You can pick a healer and play as DPS and not heal anyone.
This one time I picked Jenos, and didn't even heal once :L. No one can report you since it's casual. and the amount of beef you get from people is funny.

In conclusion conclusion: MATCH MAKING SUCKS. The community is toxic, and that includes me being part of it.

If you see TrumpOnAcid then say hi to him, he's a good player and nice person."

- Expensive skins and EVERYTHING
- A lot of bugs which are not going to be fixed as i can see as the DEV team is working at implementing more skins and crap in general

23460,"although there are a good amount of champions, the devs are starting to make champion design to best fit to demographics that lean towards loli-like characters. even with the argument of the furry champions and skins, that are also noticed by the devs as a great way to add more things, it still doesnt change the fact we are seeing more characters with less clothing. Game can be in fact fun. however bugs are plentiful and some things ive seen that arrived into the live game. For example: in the new frozen guard, at the exits of spawn there is a wall which u can walk halfway into. it messes up the rollout out of spawn and how the devs havent seen it? beyond my knowledge. Not many new mechanics appear. vora for example simply has a better version of grover's vine, the only different being that hers isnt as fast as his."

23487,great game kinda dull but still good
23488,"Upon returning to Paladins after a long hiatus, I can say it has captivated me once more. 
It's not without its flaws but overall you can have a good time if you don't take it too seriously. (lpretty much like overwatch)

I do enjoy the whole ""mastery"" leveling system as it gives you the incentive to keep getting better with a certain champion and flaunt your level to others (even though it does not necessarily mean you're good at it). The cards and loadouts also add flavor to the game and can lead to different playstyles with the same champion.
The visuals and maps are really enjoyable with bright colors, although limited. The skins are original for the most part and really enhance the experience (though difficult to obtain). The champions vary from sexy to cute, to rough, to cool and I strongly recommend getting the champion's pack to try them all out. 

Personally, I feel like, in general, it's very DPS oriented and more often than not even playing as support feels more like damage, with no dedicated healing heroes. That creates the illusion for new players that they can play it as CoD, completely disregarding the whole class system and that's when it gets irritating. But you'll also have some really good matches when the whole team composition comes together with splendid results that make you love it again.

Another area that needs polishing is champion selection. If they're to copy overwatch they should at least copy the good aspects as well, that is being able to change champions midgame, and maybe even obliging players to play certain classes for better team composition (I can't stand another Viktor, Tyra, Strix insta-lock combination).

There are, unfortunately, many OP champions that feel out of place (pure dmg that no one can withstand) that make healers almost powerless. And when it comes to ""ultis"", I find it unfair for certain to get ""insta kill"" and overall powerful ultis while others rather useless ones (eg Io).  

Then there's the whole cosmetics issue. When I started playing couple of years ago, you could unlock cosmetics simply by leveling up and unlocking chests (like in overwatch), but now, to my disappointment, you need crystals (=basically real money), to unlock pretty much anything and as such simply leveling up has lost its meaning. I really hope they bring back the normal leveling up loot boxes.

Overall, I like it for unwinding and having a good time, and if you keep your calm and see it as a game and not a challenge you'll enjoy it as well. ""See you in the realm!"""

23627,"This game has consumed my entire life, hirez has all my money. For a free to play game this is a beauty. With new characters to map overhauls to really fun battle passes, I love this game. Sure I get irritated at the lack of match making or no new maps or awkward balancing changes. I love this game the characters are loveable with fun skins that change their voice lines, they will refer to each other and have cute voicelines or something with lore, some characters are just insufferable to hear vgs spam but you can mute those people. They removed killcam and play of the game because they were buggy but I think they are adding it back. They know sex sells and they use that a bit much in some skins but i truly love this game"
23628,Fun game with varying skill levels all around. There's a lot of heroes and builds and a few modes to keep interest. It seems to be somewhere on the easier end of the spectrum in terms of hero shooters with a lot of aim forgiveness and a good bit of heroes that don't require perfection to play acceptable. Overall a lot of fun can be had playing this game.
23629,Great game really enjoyable when you find a good character

23633,"Paladins 9/10

It's a great competitive game where you can have fun playing with friends or even alone!
In this game you'll have a 5 vs 5 match with multiplous objectives depending on the mode you play.

Positive Points:
* Graphics
* Gameplay
* Great soundtrack
* Really fun

Negative Points:
* Some champions can be really annoying :D

Remember, this is my opinion, just respect please!
Have a nice Day :D"
23634,"shit game, some characters can go invisible, really unbalanced"
23635,Really awesome game. I just really hope that in the future the developers worry more about bugs and balance rather than skins and design for a period of time. Please fix the game.
23636,this game is very addictive and the grind is real. but its amazing to play with friends and is alot of fun

23642,"Love this game 😍 I had allot of love for Overwatch but after 2 years of playing I got bored, and Paladins reminds me off overwatch only imo more fun 😃"
23643,Such a good game.
23644,Free to play overwatch

23661,plays great been playing on a crap computer and its smooth
23662,[i] Fix the bugs! I face player disconnected error every once in a while and the SEA servers are laggy nd unplayable most of the times. [/i]
23663,It is my favourite game by far 2000+ hours would highly recommend only downside is more content needs to be added more frequently
23664,SOME GLITCHES IN THE GAME THO SUPPORT COMMUNITY NEVER CONTACTED ME YET BUT STILL HOPE IT WILL BE FIXED SOON.... GOOD GAME :)) PEACE.
23665,please stop going behind walls and asking for healing androxus i need to be able to see you to heal you
23666,good and is f2p just love it
23667,I try to play this game a lot. On consoles and PC. And it's fun to try out all the characters. They are actively still putting new characters. It's money tactics are scummy. But if you don't plan on spending money anyway than you might not care that much. It's fun Gameplay. 7/10
23668,"Roughly speaking, a free owerwatch.
There are some differences, at release there was generally a gorgeous original mode. The map system was added, removed and edited many times (I don't even know what it is now, but in any case it is necessary. so you can customize any character to suit your play style).
Fast and pleasant skating rinks, good voice acting, grafon + -, rather weak for 2020, but you can play on weak PCs and, in principle, it is enough to reduce everything to stylization and so on.

In general, I recommend playing if you have a desire, but no desire to spend money."
23669,"so cool, fun game"

23675,bad.
23676,muito bom para jogar com uns conhecidos
23677,yes
23678,This game is fun but really enjoyable with lots of friends. I play this game with my friends in discord calls and the game is very fun. I recommend giving this game a try. It started growing on me as time moved on. This game is very fun with friends.
23679,"fun, fast paced and free. Easy pick"
23680,"Still has better matchmaking than Overwatch, with a much less of a scumbag company running it."
23681,"Game has been out for years now, and champions still cost a shit ton of coins to buy. Not even with the 2x XP and Gold weekend they give is enough. It's such a grindfest. Some characters are so unbalanced and like they don't belong in the game, others feel so underpowered. 

I admit i have fun when i'm playing with friends, because alone can be a bit boring or repetitive."
23682,Pretty fun game with friends! Would recommend :D
23683,Very fun
23684,If only this game was made on ue4
23685,"Its like overwatch, but free. But inside the game nothing its free. But its still fun to play."

23687,Overwatch but better. 11/10

23689,"Eu poderia ter terminado uma segunda faculdade, mas..."
23690,Better then overwatch.

23692,
23693,A game that gives effort to feel the difference between Overwatch and this game but yea it was really nice still
23694,cool
23695,"Pretty fun to play. Can be casual or competitive. If you like Overwatch, I'd recommend this as the better alternative (imo). 
The constant content being added is great as well as balanced updates. Though some new characters are a bit op for a bit before devs update. 
P2W isn't really a thing here either."
23696,lots of customisability and you can play a character how you want such as how a support can be played as a damage if you decide to play it like that.
23697,kinda fun yes sir-
23698,vrey funny game i love it
23699,It's a good free alternative of Overwatch and other team based shooters.
23700,Its fun. You can play a dommy mommy angel in thigh highs. I literally can't tell you anything else I remember

23706,"If you just want to have fun playing with your friends it's a great game, there are many champions to choose from and adapt to your playstyle. There are some game modes to help with diversity and the ability to equip decks with different buffs to your champions is probably my favorite part. If you want to take it seriously and go comp/ranked and you don't have a team of 5 people to play with... you will suffer."
23707,"This game is fast paced, and somewhat chaotic and somehow manages to keep me focused on something when I have ADHD."
23708,"Fun game
good game"
23709,"great game, fun to play. it's overwatch but less refined."
23710,"The concept is great, but the developers do not care.
It is very hard to play this game when every update adds another bug. Yes, they keep adding new stuff. No, it is not helpful because it puts less time into bug fixing. Some people can't even run the game, even look at social media right now, so many people are having this issue. 

This game would be FANTASTIC if the matchmaking was fixed as well! Imagine, you start playing. Spend 4 hours playing bot games, so you want to start the average Siege game. You know what you get? you get f***ed. The enemy team has master players! You were doing so good in those bot games that the game wanted you to see if you'd do just as good against seasoned masters. And oh, your teammates blame you for getting them the loss too. :) 
There has been a lot of work put into this game, but I just don't see why they don't let their community have a word in it. I mean, the only thing that makes a game a game is if people play it. Some people can't even play it if they wanted to because their game won't let them join their game, click on anything, or even connect to the servers. Its OKAY TO ADD LONGER QUEUE TIMES IN ORDER TO HAVE BETTER MATCHMAKING. It really is. Please, stop adding champions. Please put your time and effort into fixing. Paladins is just another regular old game if people can't even play it. Its fun when it works, but do you really want to waste maybe 3 hours of trying to get it to work first? No, it does not matter on your specifications to run the game when the game disconnects for you."
23711,Noice
23712,zhin
23713,overwatch for free Pog
23714,one of the best class based objective fps out there
23715,ok.....
23716,Overwatch 0.1
23717,still a nice  game even after 260 hours
23718,10/10
23719,"Paladins is a hero shooter, much in the likes of Overwatch, but with more pronounced MOBA elements. The cast of numerous characters is colorful and they all have their own personality, even though some of them come off as rushed or not very well thought out. The graphics are serviceable, which means they are not the best but not the worst either; they are colorful and get the job done.

What makes Paladins special is its unique Card system, which allows you to customize each and every hero with your personal play style. It’s rare that you’ll see two players using a certain hero the same way, and this makes the game less stale overtime than other similar offerings. Because of this, each and every game ends up playing differently, and this is exactly what I love about the game.

The in game economy is based on cosmetic only loot boxes, which means that despite being free to play and not counting individual skill, no player will ever be stronger than another.

The game receives updates, events and new heroes extremely frequently. Even though some bugs and glitches tend to stay longer than necessary at times, they rarely become game breaking or end up taking away from the enjoyment of the game.

Paladins is a free to play title that simply doesn’t feel like one, and this balance is very difficult to achieve nowadays. A well crafted card system, colorful heroes and good shooting mechanics make this game a joy to play, allowing it to stand out among the crowd of otherwise stale titles offered by much more renowned names in the industry."
23720,Amazing!
23721,top
23722,Discounted poor man's Overwatch. Still fun to some extent.

23727,"I was beta, it was good game until over time its gotten worse. Its gotten so bad that asian and hispanic players are playing vs player to see who has best hacks. American players are playing bots just have hack free game. that sad. the game so unbalance to point its no woth it. stay away from paladins"
23728,It's fun and super engaging. The textures look really good too although i'm sure it's a turn off to some people. Give it a try. If you like competitive pvp focused hero shooters
23729,"i loevthis game, make me hard ya know?"
23730,a
23731,Its a bad game but i still like it
23732,"Fun for new players - devastating for old ones. Thats the best way i can explain this game atm,
its redeeming qualities do not outweigh the negatives.

That and the game is broken lol. Lag on servers aside, the code is poor. it shows in the game

5 years and basic problems in programming still not solved -- ''small studio'' i get it you keep claiming that, but that doesnt work as an excuse after too many times

in short game is poop, you'll love it and come to hate it. then hate yourself for still playing it wanting it to be somethingelse. avoid,avoid, avoid. i regret ever touching this game"
23733,"honestly, this is by far the best hero shooter game I've ever played, AND ITS FREE! I've played a little bit and its awesome. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good-paced fps shooting game, WITH POWERS!"
23734,pls just sell the game to some1 who cares Hi Rez
23735,"Its great tons of fun , loads of champs , good maps , loads of chances to earn in game credit for skins and such and like its free yo"

23740,very good
23741,Better than Overwatch
23742,"As far as I've played, it's pretty fun and having decent aim feels REALLY rewarding. However, there's this incredibly annoying bug where if the game fails to load a match and it forces you to close the game via task manager, the next time you boot up the game it'll try to load into that match that never really started (I've confirmed with some friends that when this happens it happens for all players in the match). This will continue to happen every time you log into the game until you reinstall.

ON TOP OF THAT after the game successfully fails to load into that match, YOU WONT BE ABLE TO CLICK ANYWHERE ON THE SCREEN/MENU. 

The game is very, very fun. I instantly got hooked up onto the game as it is very easy to learn plus I got some +150k dmg quick play matches that really made me feel like I was decent at this game, but this bugs are just WAY too ridiculous. You literally have to reinstall the game every time this bug occurs, and it's not an uncommon bug at all, it happens to me every 3 matches and as much as I love the game this bug is just too annoying.

Hi-Rez, please fix.

If this doesn't happens for you tho, the game is def worth it."

23756,"After 1364 hours this game single handedly made me lose faith in people. 90% of the player base is trolling and the other 10% can't stay connected to the game. The devs just push out skins for revenue but never add anything to the game. Save yourself the trouble and just play Overwatch.

23772,A really fun free alternative to games like Overwatch. I've had a lot of fun playing this with friends. The item and skill system is easy to get used to and the variety of champions is good.
23773,After playing this Game for many Hours and i still playing it i fond it so great and with the last patch i didn't feel any bugs and this game help me a lot to get closer to my girlfriend .so thank you

23800,off brand overwatch but has crossplay
23801,"Please don't play this game, the devs keep just dropping cosmetics instead of fixing the game! Tanks are pretty much useless, supports don't give enough healing, I used to like this game but every time you play a game its 4 dps like bro its a team based game not call of duty, idk man I used to love this game during season two, i liked it more then Overwatch.. but lately paldins is hot garbage, Evil Mojo and Hi Rez don't listen to player feed back and just keep giving us skins... and battle passes.. i get it.. its free to play. but you can spend 20 bucks and get a better game ""Overwatch"" I say that because I spent prob 50 bucks on battle passes on the game easy. so like save your money and get a better game."
23802,"I don't know why i played this game but i did and now i want to kill myself.
It has got scegz grils 
"
23803,"Well, it's exceedingly buggy. The first time my group played this game, it crashed 4+ times. Everytime I boot the game, I get a message my 'bounty' has been refunded, including when I started the game the first time.

The game also sometimes have tooltips about gameplay? Those sometimes never go away, and stay on your screen until you restart the game. The battle pass asks you to pay to unlock items you have already gotten. A few times I alt tabbed to do something else, and the game window turned permanently black.

The UI is very poorly designed, and it's not intuitive at all. Took several hours for of playing for us to figure out what we could spend gold on. There's tons of buttons that don't really do anything, just pop up a tooltip. We're still not sure how you accept a party invite, so we've been partying through steam instead.

The first few matches you play (until level 5) are against bots. Nowhere does the game tell you this. The art style is kinda fuzzy and inconsistent, The music lacks any personality or distinction and generally just makes it hard to hear. when you select a champion they say their name like they're pokemon lol.

Many of the champions are not balanced at all. Maeve, Skye, and a few others are very difficult to kill, as almost all of them have healing abilities, can fly or use stealth, and can out damage your main dps as a flanker.

Many of the payload maps are HUGE. Like, it takes you a 15 second horse ride to get back into the match when you die huge. This also means practically all of them are extremely imbalanced, since dying means playing a man down for about 30 seconds. Even grouping, all it takes is one or two characters watching payload to completely lock down the other team after a bunch of deaths. It's annoying.

Many of the healers have such poor healing abilities, that DPS / frontline can genuinely outheal them with a minimum of effort. This happened 3/7 times we played.

But despite all of this, I like the game. for one, it's free. the actual game portion works, and is really fun and easy to learn. I just wish almost everything else wasn't broken"
23804,"Genial juego, aunque tiene algunos pocos bugs que hay que resolver, como una pantalla congelada después de elegir un personaje que me ha sucedido una vez y que duró horas (vi que se resolvió al día siguiente). Sin embargo, la gran mayoría del tiempo es más que genial y dinámico. Eso sí, eso fue una excepción dentro de mi experiencia.
Rejugabilidad al 100% y hay bastante capacidad de probar los personajes. El pack de personajes es bastante accesible en oferta, y pues con todos los personajes no tiene nada que envidarle a juegos de paga como OW o algunos por el estilo.
Los gráficos cumplen, incluso en mínimo. Lo he jugado en todas las configuraciones por temas de disponibilidad de una buena PC, y corre a mucho más de 60 FPS hasta en una laptop de oficina de hace 8-10 años (gráficos en mínimo, claro, pero que corra es un logro)."
23805,"Casual being casual, so is ranked. Matchmaking exists only on paper (toilet paper, may I add) Other than that the game is pretty much enjoyable; wide selection of heroes, iconic voicelines and some good looking skins. When you have a good match you  will usually know it."
23806,"[h1]Step 1[/h1]
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.

[h1]Step 2[/h1]
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.

[h1]Step 3[/h1]
Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot."
23807,"Even though I only have like 30 hours in this game I can tell you with utmost certainty that this is one of the best games I have ever played. The movement is good, the PvP is above par, and other than a couple necessary balance changes, it's great overall.

Very good, much wow
10/10"
23808,at least its not overwatch
23809,"Good game, bad decisions and choices by the devs. For the last 2-3 years, over half of their decisions to make the game better have not worked. They have made the game really bad both for casuals and competitive players. 

This game is not worth your time, and it's free so that's saying something."
23810,"honestly, if you sunk this many hours into this game, but you want a similar game with a actual comp scene and ladder, then just buy Overwatch, its $30."
23811,overwatch but it's paladins

23824,it is a really good game would recomend i love it
23825,"More fun with friends
"
23826,good game
23827,"Easy game to get into and have fun. The community is not as toxic as overwatches but this game isn't as smooth as overwatch either, hit boxes seem awful at times and the only way to get skins is by playing a ton or buying loot boxes and they are pretty expensive and only give you like 1 of 80 possible items so it seems impossible to get the skin you want. It is nice that  it is free to play and you can unlock the heros you want with in game currency or you can pay for all heros with actual money."
23828,To put it simply this game is an Overwatch clone and ripoff and i'm surprised they haven't been sued for it yet. So... if you can't afford overwatch  this is a great option. I personally don't like it but it works.
23829,idk
23830,a blast 45 hrs without a batting any eye. Not sure how to play after I found my class though!

23838,"Sadly as a player which has played since the beta on ps4 and later moved on to pc to further play into it, i just can't recommend it. The bugs in this game are terrible, some of them are even game-breaking, for example the bug which jets off your complete team in ranked with no way to reconnect but still lose elo points. I first encountered this bug in 2018, then dropped the game for 2 years, came now back in 2020 and this bug still exists. Solely that point is enough proof for how little the devs care for this game. I played too much overwatch and hero-shooter in general to say Paladins is per sé bad, but i just cannot let this game go on how it goes right now. The balancing is [u] horrible [/u], some champions that were broken back in 2018 are still broken, like how do you get to this point? Everything in this game just feels unclean and unloved. There is no point in this game where you could say ""Wow, the devs really put some thought to it"". I think it's sad, could be a great contrary to Overwatch, but got destroyed by the devs themselves, just like every other Hi-Rez or Evilmojo Game. 
[b]TLDR:[/b] Great Potential, low effort"
23839,bad
23840,Playing this game is like playing against hard lucio bots in OW. Literally just run it down for a few days and the next thing you know you're diamond and there's an aimbotting skye in your backline.

23861,"This games really cool !! I know people have a lot of problems when it comes to devs, the community, and just in general how the games evolved over time. But if you are a casual player looking for a mindless game, this is it! I think getting past the graphics and pay wall is the hardest part to playing it. For me, at least. I don't know the competitive scene, but from what I've heard it is very bad, so I'm not going to even try and go into that lol"

23878,"Personally I prefer Paladins to Overwatch. The loadout, talent, and item systems add depth to it that I don't think OW can match. The only issue is the bots that you will undoubtedly run into. Besides that it is well worth the pickup."
23879,Recommended :)
23880,one of my best games omg i adore it  :)
23881,"Player base is terrible and you won't win unless you create your own team
The Client is a buggy mess and will find any excuse to crash or cause you to close down the game just to try and start the game several times before realising you want to play and start working again for a couple of games before deciding something went wrong and start screwing up again.
BombKing has a bug that causes him to not throw any bombs out so you are forced to leave the game or spend the match being abused in chat for not doing anything."
23882,"It's just a very fun and awesome experience, for me this game beats Overwatch and over games alike!"
23883,Its cool.
23884,"its fast pace and easy to learn how to play

23885,"The gameplay 
"
23886,"I cant play the game anymore. The game bugs on loading screen and doesnt load, also doesnt let me interact with the interface once it takes me there after failing. Then even after 2h when i open the game again, it takes me to the previous match (like im still trying to reconnect to the match), fails to load and dont let me interact with the interface. i love the game, please, fix it!"
23887,"Its like overwatch, but free and not as toxic."
23888,"is sexy

23889,"This game is for everyone, casual brits or sweaty russians"
23890,Fun to play with friends and chill
23891,It's a cool shooter
23892,"Paladins is Overwatch but for poor players.
Like in Overwatch, you get to play with mentally handicapped players."
23893,"Kinda like Overwatch but 1000% better and free, so just get it nerd."
23894,"SHIT GAME AVOID AT ALL COST, YOULL HATE IT A LOT!"
23895,"Having played the game on and off since OB43 and I have got to say that I love this game. It has so much potential to be one of the best competitive games on the market, but the reason that I leave a negative review is that this game has deteriorated both figuratively and literally over the years. From bad updates such as the infamous OB64 that killed the game's early momentum up the ranks and the neglect of implementing a proper fix to the servers as of recently. I have very fond memories of downloading and playing this with my friends. Even though I am the last one to leave this game for good, we all still mention this game and every time it comes up in topic we always say it sad to see this game die when thinking back to the old days."
23896,haha stinky poopy
23897,"good
"
23898,Game has so much potential but servers are a joke. Extremely terrible servers that work for 4-5 days and then become unplayable for like 2-3 weeks. They then get fixed temoporarily and go back to being unplayable. Personally a deal-breaker for me!
23899,"Forever stuck on ""loading vendors"" one day for no reason and has been stuck for months"
23900,yeah its bugged and runs poorly sometime but its really fun to try diffrent load out and playstyle
23901,Game is easy to get into. Simpler than most when it comes to competitive play but still has the same level of difficulty when it comes to overall teamwork.
23902,Love paladins especially since it’s free to play and in store purchases don’t break the bank
23903,"I've posted a review before ; saying that if you don't take the game too seriously it's a great game.
I have stopped playing for few months after the Halloween BP, can say that still the game is, if you don't take it too seriously it's a great game.

More on the last updates that changed and added some stuff, i still cry that i can't change HUD size but out of that, the updates (to me) are great and better than before. The community is sometimes dumb sometimes pretty cool, it just depends of the players you got matched with, happened to me to have androxus with 9k dmg and 12 death and sometimes just enemies are better... happen that i'm doing great too (but it's rare lol). 

Give love to Paladins, this game is not bad."

Not for me.

23943,Contains incomprehensible bugs. The game will crash mid-game and then give you a deserter penalty for it (when there is a way to check programatically if the player closed the game manually or via crash). Genuinely bad programmers.
23944,The actually enjoyable version of Overwatch. Hate making the comparison but it's true.

(Easy to play it and not put much or any money into it and still get stuff)"
23948,"This is a really fun fast passed class and team based shooter all the champions are unique with multiple different ways to play each one while still have having their core kit to build off of, this allows for different combos and strategy within your team comp and what you need to counter the opposing team. This game is at its peak when you play with friends and I would strongly encourage anyone who likes games like Overwatch and TF2 to try this game for yourself and let others know if you like it. also ssa s'ekys"

23952,"Solid game with fun mechanics. I have heard it compared to Overwatch a lot, and while i definitely see the similarities, I absolutely hated Overwatch but I have fallen in love with Paladins, so something must be different!

This is definitely something to play with friends- I am sure it is a lot of fun solo, but it really lends itself to a group, and having friends to play with definitely makes the game easier as well!"
23953,Its a very good game if you dont have money for overwatch.
23954,fdfsfsfs
23955,yerp
23956,"In 2017 it was a bit chaotic but now i think its in a better place. The game looks pretty good, great character design and skins. Only problem is Androxis and that he's been too consistantly good. Some other champions are also ofc op or underpowered but i think he's the biggest problem rn and its not even that big of a deal. Great game all around and nice variation of champs!"

EN Encore Mi Amors"
23997,It just works
23998,"Recently there is a huge lag between the hits and the damage taken by the enemy, same is applicable for healing teammates as well. Also the ping has become horrible these days."
23999,so good
24000,"I remember I started playing this game since it's beta and I enjoyed it so much. I remember the scandel between Paladins and Overwatch being too similar or something- but I really dont care! The game is fun, it has really cool character designs and skins! They have some really cool maps for the different game modes (some arent the best, not every game is perfect) and overall just really entertaining!
I have a laptop which cant handle heavy games like overwatch, so Paladins is really good for people with weaker computers!"

24003,"Three years for plat this game, not disappoint"
24004,"All the new characters have an ""oops"" button to get out of any bad spot they are in. The balance is a joke and they keep making more and more overpowered characters without buffing the old ones. This and never forget a while ago when they thought they could make the game Pay to Win. They tried to take your money and only stopped because it almost single handedly killed their game. Scum developers who make new over powered characters to try and take your money because they didn't succeed at extorting it from you the first time."

24015,"Matchmaking sucks. I constantly get paired up with grandmasters (top players). Either on my team or the enemy, which in both cases it ends up not being fun. 

You also got glitches that they haven't fixed in ages. 

They favor some characters over others. A character in particular has not received a new skin in 3 years while some of the furry characters have received a few amount.  

STOP MAKING FURRY SKINS AND CHARACTERS PLEASE

No new event in a longggggggggg time. 

Lore? Meh. It could be much much better.

Sometimes the game is literally unplayable...

24020,"okay so first of all... for all the ow players who say this is a free ver of ow, yeah i see the comparison but this game is so much better because of how unique each champion is and HOW MANY champions there are.. and the fact you have to unlock them by earning coins... makes me. personally. enjoy it more. the fact i save up to buy a character i want excites me AND the best part is that there are some champions which are easier to use then others so the game isnt too hard or too easy for anyone!"
24021,"Wasted over 47 days of my life on this that I'll never get back.

Switched to Linux just so I don't have to play this anymore.

It's fun, but if you get addicted to gaming easily steer clear. It'll honestly steal days off your life."

The only downside is that characters that are considered ""new"" are just reskinned and the abilities are pretty much taken from other champions and modified a little. When patches come, some champions are nerf'd too harshly. And new skins are a problem. Other than that, the game is pretty great."

Edited Again, Server still piece of Crap, takes hours to login. after the maintenance it got worse, so yeah dev are destroying the game every maintenance, and this problem existed from the first release of this game. and DEVELOPERS NEVER FIXED IT.

Edited Again and Again, at certain time, its easy to login to the game, quick and fast, but at certain point, id be impossible to login and if you managed to do so, i tried waiting for around 30mins it logins, but you wont be able to play because of numerous reason: you wont be able to click the play button, you wont be able to choose a character because it wont get click as well if you managed to queue, hence getting deserter or something so you have to wait  and after that same thing will happen. if I didnt spent any money in this shitty game I would have Uninstalled it already and delete it completely in my library."

24075,"first things first, when you first play the game its fun, and its only fun for the first 5 hours, but this isnt the problem, my problem with this game is that the characters never get nerved, skye and meavline are annoying to compete against, and its just a pain in the ass to play a game where your forced to play in the same match { sometimes whit sweaty players} until its finished with, and sometimes when it says ive gotten coins, the number of coins i had doesnt even change, this game for me will just be a shadow of games that they tried to copy."

24084,Amazing game
24085,"Honestly a great experience. It shares a lot of the design issues common to many hero shooters such as feeling tired of the same repeat encounters at chokepoints on maps, having to play a class you don't feel like playing, and teammates being rude towards each other, but as far as hero shooters go I think Paladins is my favorite. I always tell folks that Paladins really feels like it was just made to have fun with. Definitely worth checking out, especially for free."
24086,"If you want to start playing paladins in 2020 or god forbid, in the future, don't.

Most unbalanced game I've probably played, ever. It is literally more unloved by devs than me by my parents and lemme tell ya, that's extreme. Only thing the devs add to the game is recycled, unoriginal skins, and new bugs with each update. Oh and also how could I forget, the devs will never, ever nerf Lian and Vivian, because why would they, right? It's not like the game is supposed to be played by tens of thousands of people, right? It's not that big of a deal if I make my waifu completely overpowered, RIGHT?

Also the game is dying and nothing can revive it, if they added some normal non - human champion with interesting lore and unique abilites, who isn't edgy dark lord, then that would probably delay the game's inevitable death.

Last of all fuck this game, give me my 400 hours of my life back, please."
24087,trash
24088,"I can count more skins than patch notes. I can find a bug on every map. I can find an unbalanced thing on every champ. Even Vivian is unbalanced by herself. Hi-rez, more like bug-rez. More bugs than Fallout 76. And if you hold this title, there is something wrong, ngl. Game will crash just cuz. it wants to. Game will not even shut down sometimes. Matchmaking slaps me so hard. Skins. Skins. Skins. And then some nerfs. For Torvald. Instead of a champ, who is far more op than him. Vivian, Cassie, Lian, etc. I played this game since Makoa was added, and i still enjoy this game. But i hate how it is treated. Still recommending this game, cuz. it brought me joy and happiness, when i played it. Even some broken bones."

It has a very different play style because Paladins is more action and frenetic while OW it's more tactical"

- Champion power creep.
- Unobtainable achievement for achievement collectors: reach lvl 30 during beta"

24107,tities
24108,is good game. Because its free. Don't play if you want skins for free
24109,"This game is really fun to play if you're into competitive gaming, this game would also be good for those who enjoy playing in teams, and its a fun game to play with your friends or your boyfriend/girlfriend. The graphics are great and the character designs are very high quality. Highly recommend, I love this game!"

You have like 3 hours to get all champions for 14.99€ then it just goes up without a warning to 23.,99€.

Would have bought it for for that 14,99€, but missed the discount. Keep your damn characters then. 
Never have I ever seen anything this mindbogglingly idiotic."

24135,pretty epic
24136,its prety goooood
24137,"This game is amazingggg. I got into this thinking that this was a cheap low quality game but it actually looks amazing and plays smoothly. Almost all champions are really well balanced and that’s hard to accomplish considering how many ways you can customize your settings and gameplay during and before matches. Paladins is really about customization. One champion can be played as a passive backline healer in one match and an amazing dps character with lots of crowd control in the next. It all depends on how you alter your champion’s “loadout”, and this makes the game so much fun and I never get bored. The pacing is perfect too~ the fights actually give you time to think and react and there are tons of outplay opportunities.

The game does need some polishing in terms of bugs and some maps aren’t that great, but overall it’s such an amazing game and I love it!"

24139,Fun to play! Lots of bugs!! Still fun to play!!!
24140,"This game used to be nice. However, patch after patch, they piled up bugs without ever addressing past issues. The servers are a right mess, and the team doesn't take responsibility for it, blaming it on ""the lockdown"" or whatever other excuse while this has been going on for years. Their only aim is to make more money with the paid contents, while saving on operational costs. Worst servers of any online game I've ever played. 

I would have recommended this game during Alpha. Still would have during Beta. But their ""Stable"" release and every patch ever since, made the game ever so unstable and unbalanced...

They managed to destroy the champion balance over time - usually things go the other way. While having long, challenging games was the average experience a few years ago, nowadays I get a majority of 7mn games where we either obliterate the enemy team, or get destroyed into oblivion. Feels like interesting matchmaking doesn't exist anymore.

Also, there's absolutely no matchmaking in Casual game-mode. I've been matched with people who just installed the game while I'm reaching 3k hours playtime. You can guess how this goes..."

24201,"No team balancing what so ever from the player side ruins this game.
It often feels like i'm playing with people have never played a game their entire life (or i'm playing with team full of literal little kids) and will stand there and be filled with holes and not move even once before getting killed, run blindly into enemy fire multiple times and Other times people will pick a sniper character on a CTP map yet never once do anything other than snipe from a long distance just for the sake of racking up kills. Even when we're loosing the point. I've also seen people start a match then go AFK(?) in the corner and do absolutely nothing outside of spawn multiple times. 

I guess i expected this to be on par with smite where it was generally 50/50 chance of win or loose with fairly even balanced skill between people on both sides buts with Paladins your entire team is either being stomped or doing the stomping ALL THE TIME. There is rarely ever a time were the rounds aren't one sided as hell, i've played several matches where there were 0 kills from the enemy team and i just felt bad for them. 
Some kind of skill level/match making system needs to be put in place if there isn't one behind the scenes to combat this.

24211,"Short summary:
+ Not pay-to-win
+ Fun and laid-back
+ Nice and unique champions
+ Different game modes
- Takes too long to buy a champion
- Skins are very pricey
- Some things are very unbalanced

It's a nice game. Free to play, although buying champions without spending money takes A LOT of time. There are some bugs, glitches and problems in the game. But overall, the game itself is fun, laid back and a nice way to spend your time. Different fun gamemodes, cool champions and lovely designs. If you don't take the game too serious it's very fun. Sometimes broken hitboxes can be very tilting though."
24212,WIW
24213,"The large cylinder hitboxes that often allow for body shots in empty space around champion models, the fact that the only ohko's are abilities that you press while looking near somebody (read: because of the terrible hitboxes), and the recent frequent server issues that make some games unbearably laggy turn this game into an absolute joke competitively relative most of the competitive titles in the FPS, MOBA and Hero Shooter genres."

I just finished that match and had to add this extra info as a WARNING. Extremely fun and funny game that i am excellent at, but it has gotten glitchy in the past few months for some reason

24232,"It's a fun FREE to play champion based shooter whats not to like.

For a more in detail look here are some things I like and Dislike about Paladins
Like:
- FREE
- The champion based system
- The loadout system making each champion play in many unique ways
- Fun and clasic game  modes like siege and deathmatch
- The free champion rotations every Wednesday so you can play champions you haven't unlocked yet

Dislike:
- How long it takes to get the in game currency to unlock characters to play

If you still not sure if you would enjoy it download it and give it a try its FREE

24250,"free fast paced

24251,Better than overwatch. You can multi choose a roll and it doesn't force you to be a bitch.
24252,"The game crashes a lot has bugs such as skills effects stays with player model long after during the game.
Also matchmaking is awful Masters could be in the same team with players who are just calibrating. For the team game - matchmaking is the essential component that drives fun and make game more interesting.
After some cool features was cut off such as kill camera or play of the game replay after the match, I realized that now every updates are focused only on selling content. This game is no interest for me anymore"
24253,kinda not pog
24254,"buck is the most unbalanced, lamest designed character ever"
24255,It's pretty good
24256,Fun. Clutch. Gouda cheese. These are all words that describe this game.
24257,"Its a cool overwatch copy, but it fails at balancing. And the worst thing that WILL happen to you, is that some games will feel like you're on 200 ping, the lighting and animations will be super choppy and its borderline unplayable. It's not due to personal internet issues as I've NEVER seen anything like it in another game. If you manage to hit a shot on where that choppy Maeve is, the it goes through as if there was no gamebreaking lag at all, leading me to believe it's just lack of caring on the devs end, it's sad."
24258,fun
24259,Good game overall
24260,Paladins is glitchy yet very fun game
24261,It Is Epic
24262,it is good to play when you are bored
24263,"This game is not perfect. i just want to address this now because no matter what anyone says this game is full of bugs, glitches, and questionable decisions from low rez. that being said if you can get past that you will find a fun rewarding game with a ton of fun characters and customizability.
let's go over the main reason I think this game stands out. the card system. when you start a match you can choose from 3 ""legendary'' cards. each one drastically changes how the character is played, some even replace other abilities entirely. but it doesn't end there. after you pick that you can pick from 6 card sets that you make out of the game. These card sets can be built to help with cooldowns, tanking, healing, or many other things depending on the champion. and all of these are unique to each of the 46 (at the time of this review) different champions.
overall I believe that this is an amazing game despite its flaws and if you put some time into it i'm sure you will enjoy it."
24264,very fun
24265,"This game used to be so much fun. A nice alternative to Overwatch when it got too frustrating.  But over the last year, the amount of players aimbotting/hacking is unbelievable. No matter how many times we report, it seems like we just get more and more matches where the first round is constant snapping to heads as we enter line of sight, instant mystery health regen, or people ulting 5 times in 2 minutes. 

This game is actually unplayable now."

24277,yes
24278,"Amazing FPS game, 10/10 would recommend to anyone new or old to the FPS game genre"
24279,NICE GAME
24280,"Good for those who couldn't afford overwatch (like me). 
Pros :
1. Large and unique roster of champions (drogoz is the coolest imo)
2. Has a loadout system where  you can tinker and make each champion unique with different ability card sets.
3. No p2w
4. Isn't required to be run on a high end pc.

Cons :
1. Server has many issues (lag and disconnects)
2. Some champions are unbalanced 
3. Buggy maps (clipping and you can get stuck in corners sometimes)
4. Champions takes too long to unlock unless you pay for the champion pack or have the premium battle pass where you get a lot of gold and gems.
5. Most female champions look lame imo lol
6. Potg and 3rd person is removed (stupid decision)


overall if you want to play a hero shooter try this out but keep in mind the devs have some weird ideas when it comes to changes like the removal of potg and 3rd person."
24281,"Great game, I use to compete in the PPL for this game before the community kinda died. But over all the game is a ton of fun"
24282,i know people say this community is toxic there are some but really isnt as bad as they make it out to be i havent done comp so im not sure on that but i can say my 36 hours so far only one toxic person i met out of 36 hours I love this game its better then tf2 and overwatch by far i love dredge alot i main him due to my love for pirares and who doesnt wanna summon a moth fucking kracken likes hes so epic
24283,Good kinda an overwatch clone
24284,It plays better than its competitor (you know the one) despite the bigger hit-boxes. Every character has a defined and balanced (in ability count) play-style. The weapons are fun and vary in some unique ways. (No lock-on target weapons the defeat the purpose of hit-boxes entirely.)
24285,fun in the way smashing action figures together is fun. balance feels basically nonexistant but i still keep playing

24321,.
24322,Nice game
24323,Very fun to play with friends! Definetaly Recommend it!!!
24324,"It's a fun game where you can get new champions by playing the game, i really recomend trying the game if you like hero shooters or any kinds of shooter games."
24325,don t play it
24326,Es el peor juego del mundo
24327,This game is really fun when u have the right team and you find a player to main. Other than that if u have bad team is bad and have no communication its terrible. The people who play it makes the game really but besides the people. The things in the game are pretty cool the skins are nice and its like regular price for a lot of things. Most characters don't get much skins and the cosmetics are good pretty decent game for free to be honest. i have 200 hours and i would say that there will always be those moments that u wanna break stuff unless u take losing lightly.

24329,"A great free-to-play hero shooter, lots of fun and well worth a shot."
24330,"it is quite boring though not a patch on Over watch when i saw it originally on steam I said why not. so when I played it I said oh okay because the game is very visually appealing on my computer, also the combat felt fluid and responsive. All in all it rather depends on your preferences, if you are a fan of hero shooter I would definitely recommend it."
24331,I like the free Barik skin.
24332,obvious resons
24333,"OCE servers are struggling. 
Fix the servers and I'll recommend the hell out of this game"

24335,"if you can't afford overwatch, play this,"
24336,"Much better than the ""overwatch"" spin off.

Original characters
Sad that a company as big as blizzard has to rip off smaller games like this :/"
24337,"fun game,"
24338,yes
24339,overwatch game
24340,its type wack but its nice
24341,Ok so heres my thoughts. I'm a strix main so keep this in mind but at one point I was rank #8 Drogoz and masters on Bomb King as well. The heroes are fun and they're unique which is the only reason I frequent the game from time to time. That and the fact that its cross platform which is kinda nice. The environments in the game are kinda shit. I don't know if its the engine or what but walls are sticky and momentum can be completely robbed from you from merely touching a wall so aerial heroes suffer in that regard. The build system is insanely fun and also the reason I come back. Every game feels different even if you only play a few heores.
24342,"good

24343,this is just 1st peson LoL or overwatch and i love it
24344,fun but like.............................
24345,i love this game!

24347,it fun
24348,"Hi rez fix your game my God. Literally crashed 8 times today at random times and then also the  server lag is complete garbage. One other thing is you really do not know how to balance characters as well. Like it does not matter which character you are good with, if they aren't ""meta"" they aren't worth playing. I like this game alot and have spent many hours on it but this is just sad.

Edit: game just unbalanced asf uninstalled."
24349,حلوه العبه
24350,"The game will not log in,highly susceptible to hackers,cannot get past the completing log in phase,and even when it works,the gamepad stops working for every single button that IS NOT the start button. Only 1 button works (have used multiple game pads) the game needs majorly fixed,and protected. Verification for accounts is too tedious for zero protection over your accounts. The game is fun WHEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY PLAY IT"
24351,insanely fast action
24352,"Game's developer constantly shits on their community, has plenty of external issues, and they refuse to fix many bugs within the game in addition to not changing their hitboxes from the basic static ones resulting in plenty of *questionable* kills to say the least."

24393,"No customer support, got back into game after 3 years, asked me to make a new account?"
24394,"this game is great
"
24395,Game crashes on start up with the most recent update 10/10 would uninstall again
24396,"literally removed 3rd person from the game....literally the only reason i played the game and bought skins was because it was a fun 3rd person shooter. sucks i wasted all that time and money on this game for they to completely change it on me. ""3rd person you can see around corners""......can you shoot around corners? no? then stfu."
24397,"Pros: 
Free knock-off Overwatch alternative, pretty cool and has lore.
Skins for every character, for most aesthetics.

Cons:
The bugs never end. Dear God. The Bugs.
Prepare to play on other regions servers and cop the ping disadvantage if you want to play ranked.
New characters are rare, Vora just got added at least a year after the previous most recent (Corvus).
Did I mention the bugs? Seriously there's one bug right now where you can't jump properly half the time."
24398,Fun free game... Play IT!
24399,....
24400,This game deserves all the love it can get.
24401,it used to be a good game i played on ps4 alot have the 2018 skins so i can say the game is trash now we got players who are all toxic and talk shit no one plays as teram they just pick what they want 5 games in a row i had no tanks and im an io main so im healing and they want to be mad at me cause i cant keep them alive and my whole team is dps and flank and me over here trying to heal i hate to say it but overwatch is better because they play as a team yah its toxic but ur not loosing MR because ur teamates want to uto lock dps and bitch they get no heals dont play the game its a free overwatch but with free is toxic ass little kids that just really get under ur skin FUCK PALADINS

24408,eh
24409,better than every free game
24410,better then overwatch
24411,yes
24412,it has good shoters
24413,"As a free game it's ok, Haven't played it in a while but some characters are available and then the rest you can unlock with ingame currency.
Not sure if skins have changed much but from what i remembered there were a few bad ones/recolors from some loot box system (similar to Overwatch which is the closest comparison for the game, except this is a free option) but the better/unique ones were seamingly all from E-sport events.

Overall if you crave a hero-shooter and got the disc-space to spare, go right a head.
Quite unrewarding to play as healer however (Shame since the wolf-girl was my favourite), If you've played other hero shooters it's more of the same, you have to keep everyone alive through their stupid mistakes, while also capturing the point (usually solo) and while also defending and keeping yourself alive since even decades later barely anyone has learned the basic ""focus enemy healer and protect own healer=win"".
Atleast the number of enemies focusing the healer is below average for a change too."
24414,wavi gut
24415,good nice
24416,"buff meave pls♥

24417,yes man keep releasing flanks i totally dont want to die whenever i pick healer

24419,I recommend !
24420,"A really amazing gameplay experience. Playing through all the champion styles and attempting to master them is surely a bit of a grind, but that is the essence of it. Git gud. The initial grind makes the game so much more fun 30-40 hours down the line. You shall not regret this. Please fix the bugs though. Thanks."

Matchmaking is very meh both in ranked and casuals. Could use some work! Every once in a while you come across a glitch but it's rare. Overall a lot of fun and good way to waste an hour or two!"

24469,BAD GAME
24470,idk if its visible but i have played this game for more then 750 hours and i still enjoy it to this day

24472,GOOD
24473,earn money buy overwatch!
24474,"Yes, i do have 70-something hours on this and i'm not that bothered by it. This is a very often looked down upon game compared to overwatch (I play that as well), and im not sure who's  side to be on. It's a good, fun game, but ive learned that this isn't as good as i thought it was. 
-The playerbase is toxic overall.
- If you  wanna get your character that costs 60000 coins, then you'd best just buy the champion pack. I grinded roughly 50 games to get one of them.
-Balancing is horrible
- People in ranked have no idea what they're doing if they're banning, chances are if a noob is banning, they'll end up banning either whatever is in the meta, or something horrible like Grover and Buck."
24475,its cool
24476,"I just like it almost like overwatch
"
24477,"Nice Game
"
24478,"I hate the fact that people compare this game to Overwatch as I've played both for quite a long time on multiple accounts and still think this game if far superior there are more champions and new ones are still being added, the skins are amazing to look at and you can earn most things by just playing the game without a penny spent i truly love this game and understand why it is compared to Overwatch but I find it to be a completely unfair comparison as they play very differently to me but that's just my opinion thanks for reading

After post: I have put even more hours into this game now and can safely say i still love it w"

24483,Fain
24484,"It's just...not that great to be honest.

They don't really balance anything out, they just add characters that are more and more op and fling them at the other characters.
Most of the ultimate abilities are too powerful while some are just there. 
It's only fun when you have a team that is coordinated with what they're doing"
24485,"just play overwatch
"
24486,game good

24493,"this game is promoting racism, satanism and sexualisation of minors, so i can not recommend it to a friend"
24494,Very good
24495,This game is honestly just a more balanced Overwatch with more character customization and your not completely screwed if one player on your team is an idiot which is nice

24515,"This is my favorite game, I play it everyday. There are many pros and cons to this game and I will get into them but I personally enjoy this game very much.

The cons, most players are extremely toxic: every match you will enter (casual or not) people will be harassing you, taunting you, or trying to get a rise out of you. There are bugs and glitches: in every update a new annoying bug or glitch will occur. 

The pros: The game has some super cool battle passes that always give me a reason to play and it will only cost $10 or less if you don't have enough crystals and you have to buy them. Leveling up characters isn't super easy and grinding or getting high leveled characters is rewarding. The game is pretty much unlimited, the matches last 30 mins give or take and you can play without limits.

Most people compare this game to overwatch and yes it is somewhat similar but very different in it's own ways. It's a free game so its not perfect but I always have fun playing this game and my friends join in with me!"
24516,more fun than overwatch but skin are a pain to get

24533,Overwatch but it never gets updates and it's dead LOL
24534,"Its a decent game. I like Cassie, but I haven't unlocked enough characters for this to hold weight."
24535,Its good game
24536,"The game would have a lot of potential, but the developers have no idea what they are doing. The polish of this game is possibly the worst of any game I have played in the last 10 years. 

For example the game doesn't tell you the characters within the match, so new players have to learn hundreds of character pictures including every skin a character could possibly have to even know what they are fighting.

It tries to sell you skins and has a battle pass, but the skins don't tell you for which character they are so they just show you a lot of skins to unlock, but you have no idea which character those skins are for.

This game has been out for over two years and basic functionality still hasn't been implemented."
24537,good
24538,Best Game <3
24539,"its fun game with alsomst no buds now i have some error and it wont works idk why its 0xc000007b if you know how help meh ;-;
"
24540,Fast-paced and not boring!
24541,Decent Overwatch kinda gameplay with added elements of card system and mastery system. If you liked Overwatch you'll like this game. Game does take awhile to unlock champions/talents time gated primarily unless you spend money which can be a negative for players who have played games similar to this one and have all the unlocks for each champion. Can carry team somewhat solo but need to work together with your team to win as most players just die over and over instead of working together which can also be a negative.
24542,nice game!!
24543,It's a lot different from other games. It's pretty easy to learn. And I like the gameplay and also the voices for the characters.

24557,"The thing I love about the game is that all the champions are unlockable, and you don't have to purchase them.
Plus, the fact that you need teamwork to win a game is amazing, not to mention that it's super addicting, and it makes you dedicated to unlock other champions. Well thought out in my opinion!"

24565,Easy to get the hang of! and best part is its NOT pay to win! though the battle pass is cool and you can spend 20$ to unlock all champions which i at least recommend. You can look at it as a 20$ game like OW but cooler!
24566,THIS GAME FUCKING SHIT
24567,This game is so bad especially with how it does its ranked system. Why can't you do your placement matches in a group of 5? This is such a dumb mechanic only being able to do this in a group of 2 but clearly getting matched against other groups that are in a group 5 cause they have done there placement matches  is specificly designed to place people low rather than in a competitive setting. This is the worst attempt at a competitive ladder I have ever had I would not recommend this game to anyone and this review is only about the ranking system and that does not even start on how expensive new champions and skins are. Why are skins more expensive than the champion them selves? its dumb this game could of been somtehing me and by friends played together and spent money on but its so poorly designed and up kept that we will go back to playing Overwatch or Valorent.

24582,"Paladins.........



A diamond in the rough that will always be forgotten 


This game has grown has fallen and continues to be on this ever winding up down zig zag of quality....



However in almost 4 years of playing this game I'm finally happy to say they have dropped my fav and probably most balanced champ this Month, they have finally got it right that a release champ. Is not in a state of being underpowered  or extremely  over powered upon release......



Well done hirez..... I'll be around for another year let's get this game in the right direction




Would recommend this game to all..... if you are willing to deal with a few salty chips here and there

The balancing is ignored, healers become obsolete if the game goes on longer than 10 mins and tanks will just be getting shredded by everyone's absurd damage output.

Tbh, i have played the hell out of this game, and greatly recommend it. Play around with the champions in the shooting range or against AI to find a play style. I personally like Maeve for her fast-paced play style.

24650,yes
24651,So I've tried this game called Paladins and it's pretty cool. I think y'all should give it a try.
24652,GOD GAME
24653,Super fun game!
24654,"benefits :
- This is a free game
- Attractive and flexible graphics
- Interesting and efficient heroes
- Beatles capability
Disadvantages :
- Sometimes you will encounter black pages where you have to reload the game or even edit game codes.
- Coding flaws that are clearly visible, for example, sometimes you will not be able to enter the main page as soon as the game opens.
- In general, none of the heroes are balanced (you can do a lot of damage with a particular hero ....)
- Many Bug's!"

24662,The developers have made poor decision after poor decision to the point where the game is actively becoming less and less fun.
24663,If you can get passed all the bugs and broken parts of the game you may actually enjoy this. I started to play this on the switch then to ps4 then now on steam which is only has like 1/5 of my total play time. It is a fun games to play just wish they would listen more to the players.

"
24702,"I've played this game on and off for a few years now (on console) and every time I come back I remember why I fell in love with it to begin with. Personally my favorite system in this game that separates it from the titles it is compared to is the card system. The way you build each hero can change the way they play drastically. You can make the character fit your play style and make it specific to you. Experimenting with this and the talents you can choose before a match is always fun to try if you get too bored. You never know if you find something that makes a character you love even that much better. 

For being a free to play this game is also very considerate. Not predatory or pay to win which is great and it is fairly easy to unlock all 40 something characters without paying a dime. Personally I have spent a good amount of money on the game because I support Hi-Rez and this brilliant game they have created.

On the downside there are bugs here and there but I have never considered them game breaking or even that much of an annoyance on console or even PC. Give the game a fair try and just a heads up, your first few matches will be against very very boring bots that may turn you off from the game. Please try and push through to the real games to get a true sense of what Paladins is all about."
24703,"good game
"
24704,"it fun.

24705,fun game
24706,"Just play Overwatch or TF2 you poor fuck. Overwatch is like 2 dollars but the game is far better than this rimjob of a game.

Edit: Yagorath is a developers illegitimate child and they wanted them to feel good about themselves without realizing that they are the bane of that developer's existence. I have some mouthwash for the HI-REZ devs because they seem to be eating their own shit more often than developing this game."
24707,Nice
24708,This is a wonderful game. I love Paladins!
24709,"This game has good points and bad ones. I recommend it to people who want a free, easier, probably better OW. It's a great game with good characters and cool maps. Sometimes you rage, sometimes people make you wanna scream. Bots suck. But other than those things. It's pretty dope"

24734,amazing
24735,Overwatch if the developpers had 5x the game design knowledge but a 5x smaller budget.
24736,"This is a marvelous game that should not even be considered an ""Overwatch Clone"". This game is so very diverse with its large roster of champions and roles to play within Paladins. If you want a game with depth, this game has almost limitless depth to it. The average person could spend multiple years to master just one individual of the 45+ champions. This game is so much fun, great to play with an organized team, and has a wonderful community. I am shocked at how little this game is getting in terms of attention. I strongly reccomend Paladins to everyone."
24737,"good game but hot damn the bug and the server is a bit annoying sometimes, at least the devs still care so it will get fixed most of the times"
24738,nice
24739,pretty fun with snipers

24742,"the game. well. yeah its a game and all... BUT. I was eating my Taco Bell, and I thought to my self.. ""hmmm what should I do"" so... I got this game. I started playing it, and thought right away, ""wow ill play this game more than my ex played me"" and now, i play this game every day... But still havent played it more than shes played me:("

different characters that look good graphically and sweet moves.  there's hardly lag BUT connecting back to a game can be difficult after loss of connection while ingame, they dont release enough  skins and in ranked u can never get first pick if your rank is low and that is unfair"

24751,"I downloaded this game originally because I had never played anything in the genre and a friend wanted me to buy OverWatch. Several years later, I own both games, but play this one 75% more of the time.

The game itself has been through quite an evolution since I first started playing back in the beta years, but I've adjusted and still really enjoy it. I don't spend money on most things in games, but the value added of owning all the champions has been well worth it and I recommend it to all new players."

24757,"Honestly the game seems to be getting better. Would I recommend this game? If you like Hero Shooters and FPS games then yes I do recommend. Just be weary of the fact the begining is rough and throughout your gameplay there will be quite a few toxic players because matchmaking in this game is quite broken meaning you might get matched with high level players who will ""flame"" your gameplay.

All in all it's still a fun game."
24758,"no usernames availiabe, it luls you into a false sense of security that the username chooser is just broken, so you keysmash, them it has that as your name, i have like 7 usernames, how the heck are non of them availiable? BS if you ask me"
24759,I'd rather pull my own teeth out than continue playing this game. Servers regularly shit the bed causing massive rubber banding issues. There is no continuity between champion abilities. No balance changes ever make sense. Don't play. LET THIS GAME DIE IN FIRE

Stop doing so much stuff on cosmetics

24774,"I'm not going to lie, this game is fun, however, there is a huge lack in polish. The game does not feel complete in fact it still feels like a beta. This wouldn't be a problem normally but the game has way too many skins and other items in the store for this game to still feel like it's in early beta.

On a game-play standpoint the game is fun, its like a more fast Overwatch with different heroes. Personally I don't like how fast some game-modes are like payload and I think it would be better if those matches were slowed down but that's just me being picky. I also wish there were more things to play other than the three game modes."

The champion roster is good, well balanced and the card system is so far one of the best champion personalizing systems I have experienced in shooters like this. Champion picks are locked the moment you pick them, so that might be a nuisance for some people. Also, the map pool is extremely small."

24825,"Have sunk over 700 hours into this game and I honestly can't say I recommend it. 

The game used to have a thriving community in which players would actually communicate in game and work together - I don't know what's happened in recent years but this no longer seems to happen.  

The worst thing by far is the matchmaking -  instead of grouping you with and against roughly equally skilled players it tries to balance matches by forcing complete beginner players into games with veterans and vice versa, using winrates or something to try and make the outcome of the match 50:50. In reality this simply means veteran players have to constantly put up with absolute beginners who won't even buy items, and beginners get absolutely crushed, or completely carried in some games by people who have been playing thousands of hours. It ends up, more often than not being frustrating for everyone. 

It's fairly common to play games in which people are blatantly aimbotting and wallhacking - the report system only allows you to report for ""other"" and then you still end up queued against them again weeks later and they're still hacking. 

Many of the characters are almost unseen in the game because they're outclassed by newer characters and need a rework. 

The loadout system offers some depth but needs another rework - there are cards that are almost worthless and nobody uses that need buffing. 

The game still has lots of bugs which have existed for years and will never be fixed. 

The clear priority for the developers is to sell microtransactions, rather than create a quality game. 

Wish I could get my 700 hours back."
24826,This game honestly just feels like a more customizable overwatch its very fun with friends and playing solo isn't bad either plus it's free so give it a try
24827,"Every character is pretty fun to play. A lot of people compare this to overwatch but while it is similar in essence, this game is much slower paced and feels very different. For the most part it is pretty well balanced and gets updates and new content quite regularly. 

Edit: I wish I could still look at this game with such bright eyes, however the sad reality is. This game is a broken mess, the champions are unbalanced, the servers lag terribly, they don't patch the game unless its to buff an already broken champ and nerf one that needs a buff. It seems HiRez is more focused on adding cosmetics and terrible battle pass systems that require real money than fixing their game that has so much potential to be good. Sadly I cannot recommend this game."
24828,"listen, i only have four hours on steam , but i have way more on ps4. This game gets stale QUICK"
24829,Good game

24831,"it used to be fun, but now they forgot to actually fix the game and add more convenient features rather than overworking their team on skins ,chests, and maps. i'll admit some of the skins are really good all and all but i can't use these skins in-game if they won't fix the damn game"

24847,I would not recommend this game. The game is full of bugs and disadvantages players that do not make purchases. If you want to get good matches and move up you need to make purchases.

24864,"Paladins for people without the patience to read the whole thing: It’s a hero shooter with more MOBA elements without the complexity of Smite.
Paladins for people who read the whole thing: I struggled to choose whether or not this should receive the all powerful thumbs up. It’s a fun hero shooter that stays interesting after lots of playtime. Constant new characters keeps it fresh and the grind is pretty low (unless you want cosmetics, which I’ll get to later). The maps are bland visually, but the layouts are very well designed and keeps you on your toes. The hero abilities are OK, ranging from “this is great!” to “wayyyyyy to technical/situational”. A nice rotation of the characters allows you to test them against real people to see how you like them. A few weird bugs but overall pretty polished. My main concern gameplay-wise is the cosmetics. They’re incredibly difficult to unlock without spending real money and the amount of things to customize pressures you to buy them. If you’re one of those people who’s immune to this, then it’s great. My biggest non-gameplay problem is with what I think is the publisher. The constant licensing tie-ins are cringy at best and feel detached from the theme. EDIT 3: In my 2nd edit I noted the push of LGBTQ content and how offensive it was. After replaying the game a bit, I can say that they’ve toned it down quite a bit. It’s still there, but not so forced. If you can put up with numerous micro transactions then I think you’ll enjoy this."

24875,"This game is very fun to play and easy to pick up. The characters do take some time to unlock but it isn't that long and through the weekly cycle of free champions it is very easy to find out what every champion can do. Also if needed you can choose any champion the practice range. The best thing about this game is the control you have over your champion. Outside of matchmaking you make a character specific loadout that will enhance the abilities and play style that suit you. Each character has 16 cards which you can choose from. You divide 15 points in 5 different cards. That makes almost all loadout's unique. There are also legendary cards. Each character has 3. These cards can totally change your play style to more mobile, more sustain, more healing, it is different for each character. Loadout, legendary card and champion are chosen in the beginning of a game and can't bechanged. However if you're in a match you can also buy items. This store is easy to understand and doesn't need a lot of game knowledge to use good. There are 16 items you can buy and level up. These can be dmg reduction, lifesteal, extra dmg against shield, etc. Overall this game is fantastic and i would really recommend it,"

I will not sink hours into this game as i feel its not completely polished, but it makes up for it with the good amount of characters and fun gameplay. The graphics are that of a mobile game in my opinon, even on good PC's the max it can go is not really that GREAT looking. Good foundation just needs work!"
24879,It's good but could be way better if the devs focused their time on fixing bugs and releasing stuff other than skins for the same 3 champions

24906,There is a bug with gold acquisition where you don't actually get the amount it says you should. Apparently been around for years and Hi-Rez don't seem to care about fixing it. It's really annoying since skins are ridiculously expensive and just doesn't make it worth playing if you get cheated out of 90% of the gold you earn from matches.
24907,good
24908,It's a totally legitimate and working ripoff of overwatch. Highly recommend

Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No.""
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. we should be together too

Dear Mister ""I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans""
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you

Paladins today has so much bugs that they literally have a group of people, that doesn't work for the company, help balance out the game for them and report bugs that they find. Also a reason why the game was/is called ""Bugadins"" for a while by the community. If you're new to Paladins, I recommend not to play... You'll just get pissed why you can't jump (a bug right now october, 2020). wasted 1890+ hours playing this game.. just wasn't worth it."

24994,"This game is mostly described by comparing it to overwatch, so first of all. This game shares similarities to Overwatch, and is criticised for it. Yet every game on the planet is based off another game, and shares similarities, take Fortnite/H1Z1 etc and those types of games are literally just another version of minecraft yet aren't criticised for it, overwatch was literally based around TF2 and copied ideas from it. But when Hi-Rez takes ideas and gets inspiration its somehow copying. So stop with this silly logic.~

Anyway, Paladins is a good game. It's sad to see this game is dying quite quickly, the main reasons being:
1. Bugs - Bugs seem to be in the game way longer than they should be and aren't the developers priorities which they indeed should be.

2. Matchmaking is very random especially in casual mods, you could be going against Diamonds/Masters/grandmasters even though you aren't even ranked. This unfair matchmaking is something that needs to be looked at.

3. Lag - There's definitely a lot of issues with lag in this game, while not everyone experiences it. For some it's quite common, for some reason I'm pretty sure Ranked has Peer to peer connection making it so you're connected to the host, which is an outdated method of online matchmaking as it's awful and doesn't work especially if the host has a bad connection, you're in for a rough game.

4. Lack of maps, this game has been out for over 4 years yet only has a select few maps to even play which makes the overall experience sometimes very repetitive to play.

5. Lack of game modes - Again the game has been out for over 4 years yet shares the same problem with overwatch, the lack of game modes like the maps can make the experience again pretty repetitive to play.

I could easily think of more issues this game has, and the most biggest of all is Hi-Rez themselves. I don't think they really care about the state of this game anymore, and are just milking it for what's left before the game just dies. Which is actually sad because this game actually has potential:

It's awesome to play with your friends, you had a large amount of skins/emotes etc to keep you entertained or make your champion look badass, large amount of champions to choose from, you can make custom card builds to develop the playstyle of the champion you want to your own needs which is something other games don't do so I'd like to give Hi-rez props on that. Overall this game is actually so fun to play, and has so many little  tricks and things for you to find out like for example shooting on the floor with Evie the attack has knockback so you can actually use this as bonus movement at the end of say a Soar with Evie. little things like that you can learn, and develop your knowledge off.

I've honestly no clue what else to type here. but again this game is very fun but has a lot of issues, but yet again does have potential while the game is still alive... sorta."

Most of the issues stem from a 2 month old problem with Hi Rez trying to maintain their servers, and still they turn a blind eye to a game breaking issue simply because people are still buying battle pass. If you don't want to see a toxic community flaming every new player, zero shots registering, and tryhard walking Maeves, I suggest you save yourself from this experience."

25013,nyc game it seems to be overwatch
25014,"It's cute. And fluffy. And occasionally adorable. Especially the horses. <3

Quick matches, easy to pickup. Relatively diverse cast. Somehow I picked up on it quick and then completely forgot about the game for like.. almost a year? Sooooo yeah, it's good, it's chill, and a great ""get-in-two-or-so-rounds"" before switching it up.

I love hopping on solo or duo, but if you're looking to master the game, definitely better with friends. The objectives are short and fun, though at times a little frustrating when the SAME guy drops you EVERY time in three or less hits O.o #likereallydude #onlyyou? O.o

That aside, you feel good getting them kill streaks and the respawns are quick to getting you back in the action<3"

Unreliable servers, toxic community, multiple broken and/or power-creep champion design, extremely manipulative and greedy battle pass changes (forcing you to play 3+ hours everyday)... I could go on.

I downloaded and started playing a year or more ago.  And I just wasn't that into it.  I picked it up with some friends for some reason, and really dove in, using r/PaladinsAcademy as a resource.  This game has a lot more to it than first look.  Your loadout and how you use your abilities will really make or break the match.  

Anyway, yeah, download this game, try some champs out in the practice range, and start playing pubs or training missions.  Fantastic arena shooter.  And with 45 (soon to be 46) champs, there is something for everyone."

25061,the best game
25062,"Game is fun and all, it's an FPS MOBA, what else you want? XD

BUT, there's a bug that I've noticed, the game doesn't give you what it says.
For example: After every match I play, I get a new notification of what gold I've earned but when I check my balance it hasn't given me that amount (It often just gives me 5% of what it said)"
25063,XD
25064,"Yes I do recommend this game because I believe the game itself and the mechanics are awesome and very fun. I do however feel like the developers need to make this game grow to become more successfull because right now if you want to play it seriously it's rediculous.

Here is why:
There is hitboxes and buggs everywhere. It's getting less but many buggs have been around for years and right now it starts to feel like the developers are lazy enough to just call it 'part of the game'.
The ranked system is the worst I've seen in any game ever. In any game where you play ranked you will get matched with people of around the same skill lvl. That's not the case here. I don't want to sound like I think that I am much better than the players I play with but the ranked system doesn't work and here is why. New players will get matched with anyone, even has high plat/low diamond players (top 5%) you will often get matched with total new players who have no clue of what's happening. This results in an instant lose. I get often matched with grandmasters/pro's who can either stomp you (not fun) or lose while trying all they can because their teammates are entirely new to the game aswell. If I'd play call of duty, rocket league or league of legends I'd never get matched with a player more than 1 league above/below mine. In this game it's normal which makes it impossible to trust your teammates and takes away from the teamplay. A well matched game is rare.
Way to much focus on skins. While all these problems have pointed out many times it doesn't seem like the developers will do anything about it. It's just there and we just release overpriced skins for a game of which the gameplay just doesn't work yet.
Teamplay in ranked. There is no way to teamup with more than 1 friend above diamond. Splitting all friends up. This has in my friend circles caused 75% of my friends to once they hit diamond to stop playing. Teamplay is THE most populair thing right now, this is a teamgame and Paladins punishes it by breaking teams up.

The focus is on making money and not on creating a good game. Which is a shame because this game has huge potential.

I'd rate this game right now 4/10. The concept is amazing and where these well known points worked out (any reddit thread will adress these) I'd rate this game 8.5/10. For the love of god. Fix this game"

This game is very time consuming and there are a lot of things that you can grind to get. This game is like a cartoon, csgo and a free to play, Overwatch. I highly recommend this game :)"

25081,"great game love the balance but the community is very bad. you need to have a full group since that 1 person will always be a toxic child. so be warned if you want to solo play you will suffer. however there are good people as well. good luck finding them tough. if you get mad at people for being stupid then this games community will make you want to kill yourself. iv been playing since betas 2017 ish. it had a good community back there but now its worse than any other game.
so in general if you like games and you can get your own team then its a great and fun game however if you are a solo player and want to enjoy the game good fucking luck you will end up with an aneurysm after 5 seconds."

25149,What even is this game
25150,"What i love about Paladins:
> The deck building & talent systems. You can pick 5 out of 16 + 1 out of 3 talents which can modify the abilities and stats of your champion. These systems means that a champion can have several playstyles, which makes it really fun to experiment with one champion and doesn't bore you even if you play / fight against one champion for several matches.
> When you die, you only have to wait several seconds to respawn. I know this feature is not unique to Paladins, but i dont like FPS games that makes you wait until next round when you die and the only thing you can do till then is just watching your teammate's pov.
> No Pay-to-Win mechanic even though the game is free.
> The devs are still active and updating the game.

Some of you probably have heard or read bad reviews about this game because of the bugs and if those holding you back on trying Paladins, let me tell you that i only encounter 1 out of 30+ matches where i got a game-breaking bug. Yes the bugs are still there but it is not as bad as some people says.

Gameplay wise, Paladins is one of the best FPS out there."
25151,This game is so addictive and im starting to get addicted again if my other pc was decent enough to play this game I would spend like the whole day playing
25152,"I think it's a great far more fun than overwatch since when you play overwatch you are automatically turned into a meta slave this means that you have to follow the meta to win, if you don't follow the meta you just end up losing ( a lot). this makes the game not fun (for people that just want to have fun and win with any character) and boring since you always see the same meta characters. While I am on the subject of matchmaking and such i would like to say that overwatches queue times are over the line you have to wait for what it feels like years just to play one character. I am not comparing these games I'm just saying if you wanna have fun download this game if you wanna be competitive go play overwatch since this game is not plagued with meta slaves. You can pick any character you want and still win without having a single tank or support and that whats makes it fun. Stop comparing the game to overwatch please. I did not compare them I'm just making points based on overwatch."

25168,"New player review: Fun with friends.  Nothing super special here.  But, it has an active enough playerbase to yield an overall positive first 15 hours of gameplay.  If it was a smaller download (like ... 5 GB or less) it would be a solid unconditional recommendation.  But as-is (I think the DL was close to 20 GB) which makes me say closer to 50/50.  Definitely pass if you're playing solo, medium recommend if you're playing with friends.  Game requires team coordination to be successful.  Wish there was more depth to the character designs.  Some are really cool and satisfying to play, others are super basic and boring, and there doesn't seem to be a correlation between character skill cap and strength."
25169,I like.
25170,"it's fun, but there is definitely a pay to win mechanic behind it, with a lot of the more op heroes being hard to grind for. You can technically grind out each hero and be just as good as someone who bought them all, but i'd say the pay to win is there. However, it does not impact the gameplay nearly as much as you'd think, and it's still a very fun game."
25171,its really fun and all the champions are balanced. viktor can be annoying sometimes but u really need strategy to get over it. 10/10 i definitely recommend best free game rn
25172,"fun
"
25173,"Not the fanciest or most high budget class-based shooter but a lot of fun to play, very hard to put down. Biggest problem is the low graphical fidelity, needs a config mod to really take advantage of a decent GPU, good skins aren't as accessible as Apex for example.

But generally character roles work very well together, but also every character has great offensive abilities so every match is super fun and hectic."

25182,"A very enjoyable game with lots of playable characters which can be further customized with loadouts. Compared to Overwatch, this game is decided more by good teamplay and positioning rather than raw skill. No ingame character switching means there are far less (if any) hard counters to worry about and most unfavourable matchups can be balanced out via the ingame item store and adjusting your strategy.

You start out with 6 champions unlocked by default and more can be purchased with gold (which is earned ingame by playing matches and doing daily quests) so if you like continuously unlocking and learning new champions, this is an optimal way to play the game. There is also a free rotation of 4 champions that changes every week so you can try out new characters without having to buy them. The shooting range also lets you try out every champion without owning them so you can get a feel for their kit and see if you would like them, before you spend any gold.

While the devs try hard to fix bugs, unfortunately they also remove old and beloved features because they can't seem to fix them. Top Play (which is basically Overwatch's Play of the Game) as well as the third person mode have been removed in favour of reducing the amount of bugs. A lot of unique and fun character voice lines have been removed to make the voice guidance system easier for new players, instead of making it an option you can toggle between (You can toggle the VGS between new and old style but that won't bring back the removed voice lines). As someone who bases skin purchases mostly on the included voice packs, this just means that the value of skins dropped for me. The game is built on spaghetti code and at some point you will experience it. It has gotten a lot better, I just wish existing game features wouldn't have to suffer for it."

25203,"Much like team fortress 2 but cooler and more options, and its free"
25204,"Short summary:
+ Not pay-to-win
+ Fun and laid-back
+ Nice and unique champions
+ Different game modes
- Takes too long to buy a champion
- Skins are very pricey
- Some things are very unbalanced

It's a nice game. Free to play, although buying champions without spending money takes A LOT of time. There are some bugs, glitches and problems in the game. But overall, the game itself is fun, laid back and a nice way to spend your time. Different fun gamemodes, cool champions and lovely designs. If you don't take the game too serious it's very fun. Sometimes broken hitboxes can be very tilting though."

- Fun Game to Play in Short Time Spans
- Simple Game with No Learning Investments at All

Cons
-------------------------
- Literally No Learning Curve
- Games Progress Faster than Random Players Manage to Cooperate
- Ranked Mod is Not the Most Enjoyable Experience
- Most Games Are Spawn-Die-Repeat
- Extremely High Skill Capped Characters (im talking to you cod players)
- A Lovely Community with Kind Users
- Literal Absance of Game Balance
- A Lot of Untweaked/Overpowered Features/Characters
- Easy Burn-Outs
- Mostly Frustrating Gameplay 
- Micro Transactions ._.

25229,"I have played Overwatch and Battleborn before so I don't even think to look at this Paladin game. So after a while, I decide to play it, and it doesn't disappoint me at all. The game might not be too deep as other hero shooting game, but as a play-4-free method. This game is quite good and entertaining comparing to other game. The besst feeling that I love the most is a stack killing system in this game. I give you lots of satisfaction on killing other players."

25236,"I like this game. People call it an overwatch clone, but that's mostly on a surface level. Any custom to casual class based shooter will look similar to another, like how people call Overwatch a TF2 clone. But there's always stuff that sets a game apart. For TF2 and overwatch, it was that overwatch had a larger cast, and a more serious feel. TF2 has a smaller cast and a more goofy feel. TF2 has fewer classes, but a large variety of customization for those classes. Paladins has It's card system setting it apart. This way, similarly to TF2, no two heroes will be exactly the same. It has it's ups and downs, but overall, an excellent game, and does not deserve to be called an Overwatch clone any more than Overwatch deserves to be called a TF2 clone."

25238,Poor man over watch

25240,"Well for starters this game is quite similar to overwatch and i like it for that . The matchmaking is not so fast but thats ok you just have to wait for 1 or maximum 3 minutes to be placed in a match. And except for the matchmaking I had no other problems at all do play it it's really fun and also its free, better than overwatch ."
25241,"game is alright, just has a ton of balance issues. Characters that might be viable one season might be total garbage after the next patch. certain characters are broken as well. After a while not playing your favorite character and sticking to high tiers gets boring. In comparison to the other character shooters this game started with (overwatch, and battle born)  I would rather play one of those two games."
25242,very fun game
25243,good game
25244,"Paladins showed promise in the initial stages, but after they removed the kill cams and Top Plays.. it was down the hill from there. They keep releasing new champs rather than fixing the existing bugs and character balances. Ranked matches are a lost cause. The community keeps getting worse with the old players leaving newer and much refined games such as Valorant, Apex etc. Hirez keeps branching out with games like Rogue company, Realm Royale etc leaving a hard hitter like Paladins in the dust."
25245,"game sucks lol
"
25246,AMAZEING GAME GET IT PLS
25247,its ok i guess
25248,"First a quick list of pro's and cons for anyone that doesn't like reading too much (certain aspects are explained in detail after the list):

Pro's:
Lots of skins
Lots of customization (titles, avatars, announcers, music etc)
Customizable gameplay (talents + loadouts)
Battle passes (since they contain lots of skins, offer fun (or sometimes frustrating) challenges and are free if you complete it (after purchase))

Cons:
Skins are often too expensive to get
Crystals (most valuable currency) is near-impossible to get
Customizable gameplay (more on why in both lists later)
Battle passes since they force you to play the game alot.

Amazing game that has alot of content and customization.
I have been playing this game since the open Beta's and have loved it ever since i started.
The game itself is really well made and the graphics look amazing too. There are tons of skins which make it even more fun to try and collect them all, the only sad part is that they are incredibly expensive since crystals are near-impossible to gain and the skins cost about 400 crystals each (epic, not rares).
The most fun part in my opinion is that you can customize your gameplay with the loadouts system, it allows the player to choose 5 out of 20 cards for a champion then you can set them all at a level of your choice (as long as it doesnt exceed the max points you can set), this combined with different talents for each champion makes it so you can choose how to play as certain champions and i really love that.
Again the bad part about that is that certain people can just choose to play damage as a healer and ruin the team, but that isn't the game's fault, it's that player's fault.
The community doesn't feel toxic to me or anything, it's just that there are some selfish or trolling people like in every other game, that is why the loadouts and talents system is both positive and negative.
Now, the populair thing games like to have all the time, the battle pass.
I personally think that battle passes in this game are among the most fair ones, you buy it (the newer ones are around 600 crystals) and if you complete the whole pass, you get 600 crystals back, meaning if you had 600 crystals you can buy every battle pass without having to spend any money, unlike most games where it costs real money to begin with.
Now i love having an objective in games, thats why i love this battle pass system. It gives you lots of challenges and even gives title(s) for completing half of them and title(s) for completing all of them.
I would like it if it would be in waves like it used to be, get to a certain level to unlock newer and harder quests instead of all at once, but i can understand why unlocking them all at once for anyone to complete would be nice to some.

Last words for the review would be these: I find the game really fun and so is customizing and trying new loadouts and skins, just wish that getting crystals would be a little easier.

If there are any mistakes in here I apologize since I don't have English as my native language.
Also yes I remembered that the I's need to be capitalized, sorry.

Hope this review helped in some way."
25249,"Game crashes just by looking at the skins in the store, Game crashes when you are in queue, Game crashes when you load into a match. I receive a timeout ""deserter"" multiple times now just because the game crashes. 3 years ago I didnt have these issues, as a returning player I'm really annoyed by this anymore."

25271,"I'm not sure why, but this game crashes all the time for me in matches.

I have a decent rig and it's a desktop, not a laptop.

Re-joining matches seems to be a coin flip as to whether your game will crash again. Yesterday I had the game crash 3-4 times on loading menu after an in-match crash.

I've also had the menus softlock post-match requiring me to force close the game.

So yeah, not super impressed with Hi-Rez at this stage. It's free so give it a try and if you don't get a ton of crashes you might enjoy it."
25272,"Even though it has the same format as overwatch, paladins has demostrated to have its unique features and a more variety of champions. Best free game on steam."
25273,I tried reinstalling the game after maybe a year or two and I couldnt even get past the loading screen from an EasyAntiCheat error: 010011 and from what I've found you cant fix it.
25274,"fantastic, way better than fagnite"
25275,Has definetly improved overtime
25276,"Well, this game is so recommend I think"
25277,"Good, Fun, Easy game, easy to hop into a match and start playing. Only downside is its very similar to Overwtach."

I don t get how this game has very positive reviews if it gets worse day by day. I gave Paladins a lot of chances and I let it steal a lot of hours from my free time but i m just done, all i get from this game is stress.

oh i almost forgot, the game is empty (the events are boring, short), the items are expensive and more than 80% of the stuff in this game can only be obtained by paying real money."

25312,Good and fun
25313,"OK. So here's my review.

Are there bugs? PLENTY
Are they gonna fix the bugs? NO
Is the game still fun to play? Yes
Should you try it? DEFINITELY

this game is NOT an Overwatch clone. It's easy to see that from the outside looking in, but once you play your first game, the differences between the two are like night and day. The advantage Paladins has over a game like Overwatch is the fact that each Champion can have a multitude of different playstyles. With Overwatch, each hero has one single playstyle, and that's it.

Obviously a AAA title like Overwatch is going to be a lot more polished with next to no bugs, good graphics, and reliable servers. Paladins is on the other side of the coin when it comes to this. With quite a few bugs, above average graphics, and pretty bad servers. But what Paladins suffers in company backing, it excels in gameplay. The uniqueness of Paladins is the sole reason why I have played since mid-late 2018. Ask any Paladins player with over 500 hours in, how they feel about the game and what will they say? Something along the lines of; The servers are frustrating or the meta is sometimes dumb, but the game is just pure fun.

The game might make me wanna kill myself at some points, and sometimes there are some rat players, but this game isn't one that I can just put down.

Do I Recommend it? YES!"
25314,nice
25315,"uh game good for a few weeks then it becomes ok

25316,Keeps Crashing
25317,It was fun.

25330,"The game is really just abysmally bad once Evil Mojo (Hi Rez) claiming that the game is ""officially"" out of Beta which it doesn't and it get really worse patches after patches such as :

1) Champions certain viable ability got taken away.
2) Removing POTG (Play of the Game) which has shown me that Evil Mojo didn't really get paid to fix it.
3) Most of the map design literally unpolished which is affecting gameplay for the players.
4) Matchmaking for Ranked Matches has 70% chance for you to lose with a random team (or solo queuing)"

Community is full of people who don't understand the concept of this game and how to play it. I wouldn't recommend playing it anymore simply cause of the community and actual ass game play alone."

25424,"Better than of Overwatch. But often in a public match you will either carry 60%~70% of the time and get carried about 10% of the time. Pay no mind to opponents or allies who have very high champion mastery, it often counts for null. Since almost everyone uses flank and damage you will probably have to tank (frontline) or heal to win a match. Don't use maeve if you are bad at her.
DON'T PLAY RANKED UNLESS YOU HAVE A SOLID TEAM, RANKED IS A MISTAKE OTHERWISE"

25437,"this used to be the 1st game I grinded and ACTUALLY HAVE FUN DOING SO. There are also tons of champions which makes it even more fun and satisfying when you get a new champion, trust me. The only reason I stopped playing is because I wasn't able to log in to my account with my old laptop while my cousin can log in to my account and I used my new laptop and I got my account back!

25453,good game. but tf2 better.
25454,its ok
25455,"A good game, I like it better than the game it is accused of ripping off, mainly because in Paladins there is actual customization and theory crafting. Different talents and loadouts keep the game interesting for me. You can turn many healers into damage dealing off-healers, tanks into damage dealing flanks, etc.... The only reason this game doesn't get 5 stars from me is because there are quite a few annoying bugs that remain unfixed. I think Hi-Rez is more concerned with urging Evil Mojo to make more skins and champions, y'know, cause that's where the money is., Other than that, I haven't went back to OW since I started playing this. If you like Hero Shooters this is definitely worth playing."
25456,a great fast paced 5v5 game with great variety
25457,better than OW with more sustainability for the long term. very rarely gets boring
25458,"sin dudas ha ido mejorando a través de los años, paladins es muy buen juego"
25459,"This game is the thinking mans Overwatch.... If Overwatch was CSGO, then Paladins would be R6 Siege..... The gameplay is a bit slower but still explosive.... its more about setup then pure aim / mechanical skill. My best advice to new players, watch some youtube videos / live streamers and ask a few questions.... It takes time to learn all of the characters. There are characters for every play style.... your typical Tank / Healer / DPS focus and many hybrids inbetween. But what makes this game standout is the customizations of the abilities. UNLIKe in overwatch, you can pick certain areas to Buff or outright change to support your team or play style. I have many builds that will have a dmg focus, or healing focus or mobility focus etc.... Thats the part where this game stands out, is the adaptability. All of this for free is a sweet deal ! Also you can eventually earn all of the characters... my advice, if you really enjoy the game after a while, just buy the champions pack to get all of the characters. 

Lets talk about the one major problem i have with this game.... and weirdly it has almost nothing to do with the game but its playerbase.... most of the people that play in casual are bad. No easy way to sugar coat it, if you want to play the game, you will either have to carry in solos OR find people to play with.... The good news, its easy to find people to play with as long as you make the effort. Then other stupid little things like the friends list being weird or audio bugs on rare occasions.

Overall, my reccomendation is simple.... Its free and worth a try, worst case you dont like it and only waste an hour or so of your time.  If you are looking for people to play with that dont suck, feel free to msg me about it. Thanks ! 
"
25460,"runs perfect on my sub par pc and gameplay is %100 overwatch, but with a few twists. alot of fun."

25487,Es bueno
25488,"The game is pretty good as it shows different ways to play with each character on the roster with their own lore and abilities that compliments the champion you play as. You're able to make a load out to fit your own style for each character adding more ammo, health, or just a boost on abilities. Not to mention 3 skills each character has that you can choose from. You are given 4 characters each one from Frontline, Support, Damage, and Flank. Develop your skills to earn gold to buy more champions and see how combat differs from each champion you buy. If your not so confident on your skills don't worry since Paladins also offers matches with bots and a training room where not only can you practice your load outs but you can also practice with champions you don't own yet to see if they fit your play style and earn gold to get the one you like the most. If your new to the realm then add me as a friend on it Ravergamer as we can play a few matches as a team as this community is very positive."

25499,"Gameplay 8/10
Graphics 6/10

You might think of it as free Overwatch, but it's not quite right. This game has its own unique mechanics which separate it from OW. It's actual cost is measured in time you'd put in grinding champions, or in amount of money you're willing to spend because almost every champion isn't free, but the entire bundle of every present and future champion is quite cheap.

Why would you like to buy this game:

You can play almost any character in a number of ways, thanks to the cards, talents, and market in match
Game is easy to learn and hard to master
Even similar champions are quite different in match
Strangely, almost no cheaters on EU servers

Why wouldn't you like to buy this game:

If you can make yourself builds, there will always be a problem of annoying easy to use builds
Existence of Vivian
Kinda toxic community (at least on gold/plat)
If you don't want to pay, you'd have to grind each character for ages
Bugs, not a lot, but sure annoying

That's pretty much it"
25500,"kinda like overwatch
"
25501,Shit game
25502,"A fun, free game. It's not hard to play, just takes time to get really good. Not sure how some people are level 500 Seris, but just my bewilderment on that should kinda speak that people really like this game. I'm not the best at playing and frankly I don't like to play real online matches because somehow no matter how good I get I still get owned miserably. xD 

Graphics are good. Cross-platform from what I know, but please for the love of all that is good and holy, no more beach skins. xD"
25503,"Awesome game, however I stopped playing because the game couldn't run on my Windows 8.1 pc, around version 1.6 update, Its been so long and I try to join back, but I believe that my account has been deleted after 1 year plus of inactivity, wasting all those hours, and champions, gems, gold, skins, all wasted..."

25509,epic game truss me
25510,"For free, its a good game to blow off some steam an hour on a few games. Characters have cool designs. An attack character abilities can be op for some characters so this game have balance issues (its like this for the other three types as well). Also playing with randoms can get a little frustrating though as players tend to not want to balance team player types. I still recommend though because it can be a lot of fun and its free."
25511,"I think it's better than OW and the fact it is free is a big plus.
You can even change your character stats with a deck, which is a pretty nice way to change your playstyle."

25526,Good game.
25527,"I must've missed it somewhere but is anyone else having issues with being thrown ONLY into Bot matches? I've tried everything but if I get online, it still throws me into a bot game. Which is absolutely awful. I used to love this game on xbox but it didn't receive the TLC that it required and the servers started acting up hard and now I can't even get online. Sad day."
25528,yes
25529,yes
25530,wack ass game; buggy mess with a bad player base. dont play. i only still play because i basically play 4 games on a rotation per day
25531,"It's fun, kinda like FPS version of Dota but different. Still enjoyable when player is willing to spend some time to learn and gain experience, otherwise player might find himself/herself unfit as the gameplay is highly competitive and requires good team play. I can feel my hands shaking whenever I start a new round. It's ok to go without in-game purchases, but it's gotta take significant time to stock up enough crystals for new champions, so don't even think about chests unless you are rich boi.
Also there are bound to be toxic players, just remember to stay cool. In a battle on the last day of 2019, my team was pinned down and scattered, enemy were strong and swift their flank was totally on me(Support [Seris]), busted me in seconds each time we meet. Obviously we had no chance of winning. Then our tank who charged blindly into deathtrap started blaming flank meanly. The flank seemed fairly new, saying ""It's 2020!!!"" feels like he was excited by the coming of a new year and was in a good mood. Losing a battle wouldn't ruin the mood but having a toxic player definitely would. They repeated similar conversation few times then we were done. Ended up reporting each others. Bruh"
25532,is da good good
25533,it's epic
25534,FUN
25535,I can honestly say this is one of the best games I have played. I was big into overwatch(which I still love) but when I saw this game in a Facebook add a few years ago. The horseback riding made me want to jump in. The hours I put in was crazy.
25536,"Boot leg overwatch

25542,hi iam trash com
25543,"Nice game
"
25544,"Extremly fun. 
"
25545,Way better than OW
25546,"This game is awesome, I highly suggest you at the very least try. Its like TF2 meets overwatch, and its super fast paced, but its not that hard to get into and its really easy to become really good at the game, as I played this for 15 hours and I've never been good at fps's, but I got a 27 kill streak before I died in one game I played. Obviously it has its flaws, but I think you should put in a few hours before you start to dislike it. You don't need the highest end pc to run this, I used to run it on intel integrated graphics and it ran fine, if you don't like it after you try it, then that you. It's free, so try it out."
25547,furry propaganda
25548,
25549,fun
25550,it's really quick paced and fun. so far i haven't had to deal with toxic players like you would in overwatch.
25551,"basically overwatch, but free"
25552,pretty fun game
25553,its a fun game while there is annoying momments its still pretty great worth at least a couple hours of playtime just to try it it is free after all
25554,It's ok
25555,.
25556,"Really annoying when ur just starting, cause bots and all ur teammates are s**t but ranked is cool"
25557,no linux support
25558,noice
25559,"GG 100% recomended
"
25560,It is a very addicting and fun game! Love the graphics and characters!
25561,"Its pretty fun, I like the horses"
25562,"Paladins is an inexplicably awful game. It has no right being as bad as it is. The community is one of the worst in the world hands down, the game is rife with bugs that make absolutely no sense as to why they haven't been fixed, and game balance is nonexistent. Queuing with randoms is a torture I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, so you have to play this game with a 5 man, even then the game is still terrible. Paladins is a free game but your time would be better used on literally anything else you could imagine."
25563,This game is old as dirt and filled with many hackers here and there but once you realize that this the free version of overwatch... it suddenly becomes a nice free and pleasant game! Check it
25564,best game i ever play
25565,Good
25566,shortly like overwatch but paladins players they are sucks  they all play by heart no  skill no brain  but  game is free
25567,"For passing time this works good, but there are a lot of bugs (mostly crashing).
community, but mostly ranked is really toxic sometimes.
balance is OK a lot of times, but there is a bunch of power creeped  characters."
25568,Its fun. Some bugs but doesnt take much away from the game
25569,"i would at least start new hunters off with some cash to at least contribute.
 other then that i really like the game."
25570,Fun light heart game or it can be serious if you want it to. I came from another game (D2) That had tons of cheaters and the sweat community was beyond toxic. So far this community is very helping and receiving of new players like myself. Would and do rec. this game to anyone. They also have world champs which are always fun to watch to see how the top of the top play and react to stress.
25571,good game
25572,glichi glichy i aint no snichi
25573,its alright
25574,"haha yes 
"
25575,"very fun game if you know how to play, it may seem complicated at first but it all comes with experience. can be rage enducing sometimes if your bootycheeks are getting clapped by the other team but its all in good fun. lots of abilities to use and so many characters to choose from!"
25576,"cool game with super powers
"
25577,"Very fun
"
25578,"fuck you , with so many online games trying to hard to attract people , this game does the opposite. Most of my profile  is me winning but even then you found a way to literally ruin my entire pc  gaming experience to the point where this shall be the last of me gaming on pc."
25579,Noice
25580,Its fun
25581,It runs really well for me even though I have a non-gaming laptop. It's a pretty great game for free. I've played more than the time shown on a different acct. I use to play it a lot more but they're always working on more skins and characters so I come back to play once in awhile.
25582,i suck at paladins but its fun :)
25583,good game
25584,its aight i guess
25585,less gay than OW but still gay
25586,a game just like Overwatch and its for free thats just perfect
25587,its kool
25588,AWSOME GAME
25589,"Used to be fun, but now bots are taking over the game.  Wish they'd do something about that.  It takes all the fun out of the game."
25590,i think it was good but now there is to many sweats in the game so its not fun anymore
25591,"long time player on the ps4 version, its poor man's overwatch and i can guarentee you will have 69% more slutty skins than overwatch could ever offer you. (nice!) as for the gameplay its highly customizable, anyone who uses vgs only uses it to annoy the hell out of you with their annoying voice clips (grover,drogoz, and androxus are big offenders!) game gets buggy af sometimes but you'll still buy your skimpy waifu skins... just make sure you have some tissuses bud."
25592,just like overwatch. good alternative.
25593,eh
25594,bickernickerjoe
25595,"Of course there's some bugs, but the base gameplay is very good. Graphics are stylistic and run fast. MTX isn't [i]great[/i], but are fair."
25596,chill game
25597,I absolutely love Paladins and try to recommend it to as many people as i can who are looking for a shooter with unique characters and really nice art style.
25598,12
25599,cock and ball torture

25608,"Better than overwatch. 
"
25609,it's neat
25610,"I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for an online multiplayer game. It's fun to play with friends, its free, and it is constantly getting upgrades. While some people say it is an Overwatch clone, it is very clearly different, and I would argue better in some ways. Even if you might not like it, I would check it out cause it's free, and you can easily get hundreds of hours for a small price, or no price. It is one of my favourite games of all time, and I would recommend it to all."
25611,i don't like describing. find out for yourself.
25612,"I love this game! It has its issues, but it is super fun with friends!"
25613,"Good game.  Isn't as popular as it was back then.  But still, fun.  Definitely would recommend."
25614,yes
25615,"The game used to be fun,i played it on my other acc since Sha Lin was intrduced.I really liked it but now Hi-Rez just ruined the game newer champions are too OP(Koga,Tiberious,Imani...) and it doesnt feel like it used to.The game where ur having fun and all those stuffs its just not the same game anymore,i wish that theyll fix it as soon as possible"

25624,Ive been playing this game for quite a while on all the platforms and all im gonna say 100% than Overwatch for the simple reason all characters have a multitude of playstyles however overwatch character playstyle is very Fixed.

25646,"The playing experience is not good.
Too many matchings with disarities.

But its easy to play like O***W**** for free."
25647,its like overwatch but free
25648,"Update 2021:

Game's dead, barely anyone plays, you see the same people over and over again.

Community is EXTREMELY toxic. Worse than even Overwatch or League of Legends. At least in LoL it's only one person every game trash talking. In this game you go into ranked, you fight ONCE, someone on your team says ""I'm AFK you guys suck"". That's that, you have lost the match.

After match you point out they were afk, and now the enemy team starts flaming you and telling you how bad you are... while they won a 5v4.

Game isn't even that bad. But the community? I would stay clear of this game if you can help it just so you don't have to run into the kinds of people that play this game. Which if I had to guess? Is a bunch of 12 year olds who are neglected by their parents, so they aren't socially adjusted, and said parents also won't buy them Overwatch because, again, neglected."
25649,Ya desinstalalo marko gue es x tu bien

It pretty good"
25651,"it good

25652,amazing game that i cant stop playing really love this game i got 2600 hours on it and that can tell you that im not wrong
25653,"amazing game you have a gem here, but the match making in ranked it so unfair sometimes beside that its the best game i have ever played <3"
25654,kool game
25655,"This game started off as an 'Overwatch Clone' but it has evolved since then. It's carved out its own unique part of class based shooters. With the 'Talents' and different loadouts which can modify just about any part of a champion, every match feels just different enough to stay interesting, and similar enough to not feel unfamiliar. I love this game more than I ever expected to."
25656,"Dogs**t game, devs dont update, but they are on top of other things, so yeah im banned"
25657,"Only giving it a thumbs down because IDK how this game got into my library, I have no recollection of every playing it."

25660,U get matched up with so many horrible players that are brain dead
25661,bad game 0/10
25662,"A straightforward team shooter.  The graphics are good and the gameplay is smooth.  It has the same generic heroes and game modes as most other games like this: point control, push a cart and slaughterhouse.  The community is nowhere near as toxic as a certain other leading game, and players actually try to pick a complete team in most PUGs, which is nice."
25663,"the game is great

25669,"It's a very good game....i liked it more than overwatch ...the mechanics are cool, GRAPHICS quality is good etc. Overall a good game to play and pass time
"
25670,"I like the concept of the game, and the fact that this is like overwatch but with so much more diversity in characters."
25671,"Good game, but they need to fix their ranked match making!"

25679,its ok
25680,I only play cuz i was here since OB started
25681,It is very good game.
25682,great game. very fun. nice tits.
25683,"Cool game just like overwatch
"
25684,Remarkably unfun.
25685,"Pretty fun, most people seem new to this style of game and doesn't have a big following so it is not as mainstream as overwatch. Regardless I have been dumping hours into it because the champions are very fun to play."
25686,"When you feel like you can't aim, play this game it is SUPER forgiving. When I'm frustrated at PUBG, Apex, MW2019 and Overwatch, I play this. Makes me feel like a left click God."
25687,"Pega sua visão, teu beck e tua mina"

25695,Awesome
25696,its fun

25701,good fun
25702,good game
25703,"You would be surprised how good this game actually is. I initially played the game thinking of it no less than an Overwatch clone, but I ended up having more fun on this game than I did with Overwatch. Until they add a Genji clone. My opinions only, yours matter more than mine."
25704,good game
25705,"700+ Hours in, it is still loads fun. The loadout system is really the game changer and is easy at the same time challenging enough for anybody who loves fps and moba!"
25706,No 21:9 Ultrawide support just blank lines for half your screen. They can't do basic coding I guess idk because it can do 120 fps screen just fine.
25707,bad game
25708,awesome
25709,Balance?
25710,Game is a buggy mess and the devs dont care for the game anymore and are just trying to get money out of the last people playing

25732,"Better than Overwatch.

10/10"
25733,its rly good and look like overwatch
25734,Da
25735,"This is a fun game. Only downside to it is the intense amount of fan-service the developers do. Since most of the fans/player-base is horny teenagers looking for a quick wank, the developers decide to release several unnecessarily sexualized ""titty baes"" instead of sticking to a normal, fitting fantasy design for their characters. Play it if you want, the game is really fun most of the time if you take out the bad team compositions but this is just my honest opinion on the developer's poor design choices."
25736,"Good alternative for overwatch, plus it's free."
25737,Teams are super unbalanced and everyone picks damage. Cool characters I guess?
25738,"Game is ok. Nothing special, like an awful spinoff of overwatch, without 5 year olds screaming, just 7 year olds.

Update: Game is still like overwatch, but actually better now since overwatch 2 is $60 for the same garbage. At least paladins is free."

25740,"Pretty cool game, haven't played in a while though. I stopped playing when they changed up the vgs. I (believe) I can't say phrases I used to say, for better or for worse--kinda ruined my immersion with characters a little bit. Still a fun game to get back to every once in a while."
25741,"Fun game, it is very similar to other hero shooters but following a f2p model. In my opinion this game is more fun then overwatch."

25744,attack the objective
25745,"Pretty fun and easy game to learn overall. Over 30 champions to pick from depending on what role you wanna play, from tank and support, to dps players. Bugs have been a longstanding issue with this game, but having played from OB to now, I will say things have gotten better on the whole. For the most part, the community is pretty positive and welcoming to new players. Also, who doesn't like free stuff? :D"

BUCK AND SHA LIN SAVE THE DAY!!!!!!!!!!"
25764,"This game has amazing promise, but the glitches and matchmaking are so bad that the game is often just a pain to play. Don't play this game until the devs get their act together. As bad as OW can get, it's at the very least polished."
25765,I will be glad if you give me a award
25766,"yes
"
25767,It's a huge ripoff from overwatch but I still want to play it because it's free. The only downsite is that there are some hackers and the comunety is pretty toxic.

25780,"The game is fun, it's better match if you have low requirements for games and since the new bounty store you don't have to donate money to get some skins.
It's better to play in a party, 'cause in solo gaming there is a high chance to match with trolls, afks etc. I don't know why High-Rez doesn't ban cheaters. They are in every second match. It's ridiculuos.  I used to play every day just after work but bugs and stupid matchmaking eventually made me to look for new games."

25786,"I have been playing this game for a very long time but ever since it collaborated with Evil Mojo, many new players joined. I didn't like the fact that I was paired up with toxic 9 year old kids who didn't know how to even left click. So, I left the game for about a year. I recently came back to this game with my friends and it was very nostalgic. However, I often get paired with very trashy players and I often get mad. I hope that this game would change their matchmaking and pair experienced players with higher level players. -Thehalfgamer5 (My Username)

25787,"Good game with many possibilities and good potential too. Just a little buggy 
"
25788,"its a fun game, ._. thats all i had to say"
25789,"good game
"
25790,"If you're broke and cant play overwatch this is the next big thing
"
25791,"First off the game is really fun. I like the style of the game. But the amount of bugs in this game is ridiculous. I've played this game for a long time now and some bugs that have been in the game for years are still there and instead of fixing them they push out more paid content like a battle pass. Even their 'fixes' are terrible. Paladins used to have a feature with replays and showing the best play of the match which surprise surprise was buggy as fuck. Their solution to this was to just give up on it and remove it, even tho getting best play or seeing it was one of the best parts of a match. I've been trying to play this game more recently but every game without fail I come across a bug. For a game that was in beta for years and claims they're in full release it needs major improvement."
25792,good game
25793,"I hear a lot of people hate on this game, and I don't get it. I'll explain why.

This game gets compared to overwatch, understandable,  but I think this game has enough differences to have a different target audience, and I feel like I'm that target audience, The thing with this game is there isn't going to be a situation where you like one character and its the only one that really fits how you like to play, this happens to me in overwatch and seige, but not here. In this game you can customize the champions to fit a desired role, so I don't mind playing a healer for instance, because I can play a healer that I gave high damaging and slightly tanky stats so I can heal my team a little less efficiently, but bully the other team at the same time. I can choose a all damage character, but give them movement speed so they can fill a more flank style role, I can play a tank and make them deal a little more damage, I can make the characters fit my playstyle rather than having to get a character that is my playstyle. This to me makes the game so much more fun and dynamic, and i no longer get mad when someone chooses my main character. Super fun, can't wait to try out ranked."
25794,Decently fun game
25795,very good
25796,good game easy to start and is still fun after ages of play

25799,This game is just so much fun for a free game. I truly enjoy this game and have a special feelings while playing it.
25800,Dont have Overwatch?Then its a good supplement.
25801,"I've put countless hours into this game on the PS4, recently started to shift towards gaming on PC and wasn't sure how I would find it using a mouse and keyboard (Yes, I know you can plug in controllers these days but I wanted to give it a try). So far i'm loving it, movement is taking a bit of getting used to, but aiming and firing is much easier to be accurate.
Now onto the game, Paladins is one of those games which is fairly easy to pick up and very hard to put down, no, it's not perfect, matchmaking can sometimes be a little whack, but if you're looking for something fun that you don't have to concentrate on too much, give this a go. I do recommend paying the £12 ingame cost to unlock all current and future characters as it gives your gameplay possibilites for more options when you're last pick on your team and need to balance out the character types (Support, damage, flank, Frontline). 
When you start playing, you will find that there are a lot of people who don't understand the different character roles and strengths (They just pick someone they think looks cool and run round the map like a headless chicken trying to run up face to face with enemy frontlines and go toe to toe using a squishy little flank character etc) or the need for balanced Team make-up. You will have games where the enemy just rolls right over you because of players like this, but persist and get to level 15 and you can unlock ranked games and you'll find that the majority of ranked players have a much better understanding of this game and you will have far more close fought, enjoyable games."
25802,pretty cool
25803,"It's in a weird spot for me, I have 432 hours on it, I've mastered Maeve, and there's 30 something other characters to try, but it's just... weird. The people in it are kinda toxic, It's a free game that's similar to overwatch, so a bunch of kids are gonna try to play it. It's like how Altspace VR is similar to VRchat... Idk even how to rate it, but my 432 hours are gonna give it a thumbs up. Just play it."
25804,i liked everything i cant think of a flaw
25805,"I can't recommend the game in this state right now. The same bugs over years now, and some balance from champions that for some reason beyond godlike. 
I think I gave enough hours of my life for this game, anti-cheat that doesn't work, ranked trolls, and yet maeve again nerfed hard since nine lives patch.

I'm sorry, Hi-rez. 
Hope you can fix your trash for other, I'm just done."

25847,i forgot i played this game but overwatch is better anyway
25848,"Game terbaik pada masanya. mampu memberikan kebahagiaan semu kepada gamer ekonomi lemah yang tidak bisa mencoba overwatch. Pada Zaman game ini keluar tahun 2015 terjadi kemelut dan perdebatan siapa yang lebih baik kala itu Paladins atau Overwatch, banyak konfrontasi dan debat di sosial media. serangan demi serangan dapat di tahan oleh kubu paladins karena mereka tahu pihak merekalah yang lemah dalam kasus ini, tapi dengan solidaritas dan rasa senasib sepenggungan komunitas paladins bisa bertahan sampe saat ini. Nilai nilai luhur pada game ini tidak pernag pusar. Gameplay yang mirip denagn OW, bugs dan inovasi yang minim serta server yang stabil game ini cocok di mainkan di komputer dan laptop kelas low life entry dan kalangan ekonomi lemah. Grafis standar yang memanjakan telingan dan sound efek yang memanjakan mata menunjukan begitu bagus kualitas dari game ini sampai sampai anda bisa mendengar gambar dan melihat suara."
25849,good n that
25850,"This game is less stable than the 2m lego tower i built when I was 6.

I love some of the concepts for the champions. Some of them are executed really well but the hit boxes and shooting just don't match the quality of the ideas. in game, most things work fine but opening menus randomly causes black screens and some other weird things.

I think the ideas and gameplay are pretty good but it feels the same in terms of functionality when i started playing during Beta 30...

Overall Score 6/10"
25851,Used to enjoy playing this game
25852,Good gameplay
25853,very good game best game ive ever played thats free already have the champion pack i really reccomend paladins
25854,its fun
25855,"Paladins is a classic 5vs5 PvP game, just like the others. I recommend to play this game with a friend. It's fun."

25861,to wapo la verda
25862,its just not fun
25863,Soooo much fun. Even runs on my 9 year old Dell Latitude laptop.
25864,Teams are so toxic that it just ruins the game. Someone bans the wrong character? gg someone is going to afk and feed the whole match. Either your team is good and you win or your team is bad and you lose. There's not a lot of middleground
25865,"good to play
"
25866,"alpha player here.... spent over 2000 hours on PS4... oh how my poor sweet child has fallen..... RIP paladins unless mojo does SOMETHING to fix all of the bugs and issues present, along with poor matchmaking and insanely long ranked queues..."
25867,very great
25868,"I have played this game from time to time to check the improvements, at this very moment I can confidently say this game is definetly worth to play, the improvements, the addition of content over time, it should be just an example of development for other game developers. Great work, after Team Fortress 2, I choose paladins over overwatch and other similar games. I used to choose overwatch but Paladins really took one step further as I can see right now, it is just really enjoyable experience."
25869,If you liked Overwatch or similar games you'll enjoy this one.

"
25877,Fun casual game to pass the time.
25878,"Its good, its free. It has some key elements that are different from overwatch that people keep comparing it to. For example you can build your heroes to keeter more to what you play like, theres a kinda big rouster. Maps are fine. Id recommend. Some might like it better than overwatch because of the skill building and that. I personally would play overwatch instead, but for this being free and all its pretty good. 7/10"

25892,"Nice game, 10/10 would meme again. Fun to play with friends, not so much on your own. Pretty decent gameplay and ping (if you normally have good ping). Hitboxes are a little weird sometimes. Lots of furries and waifus for those of you that are into that stuff... you know who you are

Haven't tried ranked yet since it takes 12+ hours to grind up enough coins for a 60k champion... and that 12 champ requirement T-T"
25893,"Amazing gameplay with all the tools you need to express yourself via playstyle. However, the game is shifting away from its mobility meta and feels very tame compared to what it once was. management also is very toxic sometimes, so stick to certain areas of the community and avoid maeve fanboys at all costs."
25894,its been really fun the best free 2 play game yet

25903,"Its like overwatch but without as much healer advantage, and it focuses more on the dueling aspect of hero shooters rather than the teamfight ultimate fiesta that is overwatch. 

10/10 would Andro again."
25904,Its Fun
25905,Paladins is so action packed and TONS of fun
25906,"started playing recently and wish i would have got into it sooner, its extremely fun tbh. my main games are runescape, and was league. now i just play this instead lol. i can say coming from league, specifically as a support (and pref support in paladins) there was definitely some crossover knowledge that helped me out a ton as a new player, mainly positioning i think.

i tried realm royale first, and not only is it less active, but its just not as satisfying so i hope hi rez keep doing the right thing ya know? gl hf to all the peeps out there, and dont tilt <3 everyone has rough games."
25907,its fun lmao
25908,good
25909,its good
25910,it's very fun but you have to play solo very much
25911,"I personally am not skilled in fps. Paladins allows you to play different play styles, with characters you learn to love. Very competitive,fast paced fun."
25912,"The game crashes frequently which makes it unplayable and the devs refuse to implement 21:9 support because it gives a ""competetive advantage""
Excuse me, what the fuck?"
25913,"Game is good, the other things are not bad, every features go well."
25914,smooth playstyle and awesome heros
25915,I have played this game on the switch and have put in almost another 120 hours to this game and it is a blast. It can be buggy at time with slight interaction problems or a skin that doesn't work properly but overall this game is lots of fun and I enjoy playing it.
25916,its very cool
25917,"FUN  but takes alot of grinding
"
25918,"its a good game similar to other games i have played, i have gotten addicted quick."
25919,very good game
25920,"Highly entertaining, addictive, and unique fps game!"
25921,is fun
25922,yeet
25923,it is a fun alternative to Overwatch
25924,"Paladins is a free to play hero shooter with options. Play wise it close to Overwatch and alot of other shooters, though has other important features like a mid-game store like SMITE or LoL and loadout and talents. I have played this game for a few years and i do highly recommend it. Especially since it comes with NO price tag. And all purchasables ether save abit of time or purely cosmetic (mostly there to support the creators). So go ahead and give it a try, if its not your cup of tea. Nothing lost"
25925,"Loved this game for years
"
25926,bad
25927,ive been playing the game recently and ive had a good time but there is a lot of sweaty players
25928,Super great game. I am addicted
25929,This game is full of  bugs and so incredibly frustrating to play . Toxic community
25930,"Overall well balanced, fun game"
25931,"If you want to go bald early this game is for you! Half the time the team will be mostly bots that are programmed with a typewriter, twenty five percent of the time your team will purposely throw the match, the other twenty five percent you may have a half functioning team. The Match Making is non-existent, it will either be a landslide victory or loss, or five to ten percent of the time a really good match. I continued playing for that five to ten percent chance of a good match, but after 1700 hours I think it isn't worth the wait."
25932,"Great fps, love how you can make each character unique with the card system."

25940,Love this game. I have been playing it for years and can not get enough of it.
25941,..
25942,"Great game, bugs are being fixed slowly but surely, the depth is probably the best part.

Loads of characters to learn to play and with the Loadout System and Talents, each champion can be played very differently or tailored to suit your playstyle.

Their Esports took a hit but it was in order to save money, so no worries. The game isn't dead but a lot of people either play through Epic to save some processing power, instead of having Steam run in the background, plus Console players are there.

With balance changes made every so often, the META certainly changes often as well, as well as the introduction of new characters can sway the way people play, pick or ban in Competitive and Ranked games.

The game has a lot of great things in one package, definitely not perfect or balanced, but I stuck with it for a long time, and yes, it quickly turns into a SALT MINE, but that's the case with all Online Games."
25943,very fun
25944,"good

25945,Just played for 1 game. Already got nonsense violation crap. #0000018H. Totaly waste of time.

25948,omg fum game so bad it is good
25949,fun
25950,Simple team vs shooter with no money required for core game experience. Money is only for cosmetics.
25951,"Super fun, especially with friends. There is just two main problems however: 
1) you can't really tab out, sometimes not even into an overlay or the game may crash, if you try to tab out through task manager
2) competetive is full of absolutely toxic people who will purposefully ruin the game, when they decide you are gonna lose anyway and not even try
Despite that, it is fun and it's weirdly addicting, would recommend trying it out, especially since it's free and it is cross-platform
"
25952,"it good, sometimes, im bad"
25953,good Shooter game with class
25954,"Played the game back in 2018. Made an account, did all that jazz, played characters etc,

I can't remember if you could level characters and make them stronger, or gain rewards for playing etc but I do know that when I played back in 2018 I made an account.

I launch the game 2 year's later and there's no login button? I tried to use my account name when it told me to sign up but it said it's unavailable.

Where's the login button? How do I use the account I used back in 2018? Why is it not synced with Steam?

Trash game, rip off of LoL. Only thing that's different is you ride horses at one point, the game's first person, and instead of attacking and defending when needing to, the game TELLS you which role you will be playing (attacking or defending)."

26015,negerrrrrr
26016,"If you prefer a healing role, this isn't the game for you.
Being a healer in this game is terrible, even when they nerfed Cauterize several times (biggest nerf so far is 30%/60%/90% reduced healing to 25%/50%/75% reduce healing,) which still cripples healers to double digit healing numbers trying to beat 4 digit damage numbers. Everyone rushes Cauterize first, it even stacked with team mates (at the time I quit). Your team mates have dozens of ways to heal that's way better than what you can provide. You're better off going completely offensive or just going anything else. Not to mention there still a lot of bugs with healers even after my two year break from the game.
I've tried as a healer in ranked and ended up in plat I (borderlined diamond V) before I quit. The game had a lot of balance issues and other things I was hoping they'd ironed out, but never really did. I had way more fun playing any other role than healer, aside from completely offensive Jenos who has respectable headshot damage for a healer.
It just sucks not being able to do anything, all you're really doing is trying to kill the enemy before trying to heal team mates which should sounds good on paper because you're part of the action, but in this situation, just makes healer kind of pointless when your team mates could just invest into Kill To Heal and gain just as much health compared to your healing."
26017,fun game but better to play with voice chat because your victory depends on your team roles and how well you communicate and play together
26018,"if you can look past the visuals that are about as appealing as an anal prolapse, there lies a genuinely fun game that you can put a lot of hours into. the gameplay & balance are great, but the game is brought down by hi-rez studios' flawless ability to introduce more bugs & exploits than gameplay features per patch. Paladins (tm) is an unpolished, unattractive, buggy, enjoyable and pretty cool ability-team-shooter game so give it a play

is also a team shoot game."

26043,"Paladins
Generally a fun game, while it can take a long time to unlock all the heroes (I simply paid the 15 dollars to unlock them all instantly, which is a steal) this doesn't take away from the fact that it's a good, free alternative to some team based shooters out there that might be a tad bit more expensive. Easy to pick up, games will only last anywhere from 5-10 minutes. Best part is, it's completely free. There is no ""Pay 2 Win"" aspects, most, if not all champions are balanced in their own ways, and can all counter one another in some way. The only micro-transactions that exist are when it comes to buying crystals which are used to buy skins, which don't affect gameplay at all. With 25 hours ingame currently, I can confidently say that I am enjoying Paladins."

26055,"Fix you zhity match making, Premade bully team's againt casuals thanks."
26056,poop and cum
26057,"Paladins feels really similar to alot of other champion-based games so if you're into those I'd recommend it.
There are alot of nice unique champions but it needs more ingame content."
26058,As Sohaib once said ''Good''.
26059,good game played for like a hour a years ago
26060,Its fun
26061,This is a fun game. You just need to practice each champion.
26062,"The guns don't feel as satisfying as guns in games like Destiny or Call of Duty. On the other hand though, this game is a lot of fun and I had a lot of fun playing all the different characters and would recommend as a fun game to play with friends"

26070,Its fun but rage inducing.
26071,"I havent tried playing in ranked/competitive modeI play the casual mode, almost like a arcadey experience.If you are getting trashed, at least the match ends real fast."
26072,It only says 3 hours but i have over 100 I carried my data from my switch to my computer overall this game is pretty good I don't want to see this game die and continue on the path that its on because ive had a lot of fun with this game and it was one of my favorites along with rocket league splatoon fortnite gw2 and  battle for neighborville I know I sound like a little kid with the games that I love but I just don't want to see this game die.
26073,fun game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
26074,its good
26075,"it's a really fun game to play, that's all i can really say

(2022 UPDATE)
so it's still fun but i've noticed some problems, and i don't know how i never noticed them when i played back in 2017.

i still recommend this game, but just know that there are many bugs within the game, some of which have gone unfixed for a long period of time."

26086,"its pretty fun and competitive, if u like overwatch or valorant, u would most likely like this"
26087,Good fun game
26088,Great game

26093,really great and enjoyable game but i dont even know i got banned lol pls unban me
26094,good
26095,VERYGOODDDDDD
26096,Its fun to play with the card system and fun to play with friends.
26097,As a person who suffers from motion sickness pretty terribly playing FPS I loved this game. . . Now I can't play it which sucks . . . .
26098,nice gameeasy to understand
26099,The devs kept making terrible decisions
26100,BETTER THAN OVERWATCH!
26101,"It's like Overwatch, but for free. Good game."
26102,;...
26103,best game very underappreciated
26104,good
26105,Its a really good game I would recommend this to anyone who can't get overwatch and I've been playing for 4 hours and I'm really enjoying it.
26106,paladin
26107,kinda like overwatch
26108,Free
26109,"One of the most played games in my library, would recommend if you don't have either the specs or money for Overwatch. Since it's really just the same but free and any potato would play it. for every seasonal update there's a lagg and server failures but hopefully the devs would fix that soon. Having other things other than crystals and coins to have skins like the new ""Bounty"" update, it makes me feel more excited to do all the quests and get all the bounties to get rare or legendary skins on the market."
26110,"thats a good shooting game. It has lots of different characters, weapons, kinds of a match and places."
26111,i like this game but i feel it's also very unbalanced i would play it more if they nerfed some characters
26112,is like overwatch but less cancer and with more bugs
26113,"Diverse character lineup, fun gameplay"
26114,"Not gunna lie, this game is really addictive, but it would have been a lot better if the devs paid more attention to the development, and coding... More events, better occassions for players to feel excitement to play, not just with battle pass, skins or battle pass challenges. This game has a lot of potential that is kinda going to waste."
26115,Bugadins
26116,Nice
26117,Not played to much but addictive game and fun to play with friends
26118,It's a good game. Lots of fun and constant unique gameplay due to the champion card setups. Good for fans of shooters and hero based shooters. There is a lot of bugs in the game but they're getting better at reducing them and they aren't game breaking or anything either. Overall I'd recommend to give it a shot
26119,go play overwatch
26120,My team keeps getting their ass kicked.
26121,"Paladins Community: No you can't just start and be decent, Me: Haha Vivian go brrrr"
26122,morra maeve
26123,ok
26124,"Used to be about customizing a character's build and finding the champion for you, but then I put 50 great hours in and started playing godly players. That's when the game became less about what character I was best at it and instead which character countered the enemy and not about which load out I thought was fun but which was in the meta. Play this game if you love MOBAs its honestly great and does what OW but different, but if you want an intro to the genre then just leave it be."
26125,Not bad
26126,Good Good Good YAY
26127,"Btec overwatch nothing more or less to say bout it, done."
26128,"Its free and relatively similar to Overwatch, but it is cross platform and really fun with friends."

26148,"More than 500 hours on PlayStation and the gameplay didn't become better. Killcam and highlight got removed to fix bugs. To be honest nothing changed, the game is still full of bugs. Also the spray meta don't get any significant nerfs. No skill and no fun."
26149,great game do play
26150,GG
26151,"yea
"
26152,Good GAME
26153,Overwatch had a sister from West Virginia and her name is Paladins.
26154,"A hero shooter with much more depth and complexity than to be found any where else. While there are rough areas of the game's design, it makes up with such customization to any hero with many of them having multiple different and viable ways to play them. In that way learning the heroes is a continually evolving understanding of the game and your playstyle within this game, bringing me back to this game over and over with all the possibilities it has."
26155,Great hero shooter with tons of heroes to choose from.
26156,"Mto bom, Very good"
26157,d
26158,It's very addicting and it was made before overwatch so this is the OG overwatch

shit game lmao trash devs"
26177,"Coming from a long-time Overwatch player, this game is really fun and easy to understand, way more fun in qps than OW -as long as you don't have afk players in your team-, but the ranked system may need a revamp. The waiting time for the queue and the pick and ban is longer than the actual games..."
26178,.
26179,no
26180,hd
26181,ta duro
26182,fun game that you can see the devs putting in time and effeort to balance it i have yet to encounter buggs
26183,"PROS:

-Very fun game especially with friends
-Most skins and legendary skins are actually grindable, Not even that hard to grind
-Developers always listening to their community
-Wide range of champions to play
-Only 2-3 hackers encountered so far after 1k+ hours of playing
-Progressive enhancements to the game
-Welcoming community (sometimes)
-It doesn't need a high end pc
-Nice graphics
-It's free!


CONS:


-Champion abilities and roles can put the enemies or you at a huge advantage in 1v1's
-Some champions actually require no aim and deal damage which kinda goes against the idea of an fps shooter
-Sometimes the match making gets fucked up
-The game has tons of bugs and unstable matches (the bugs got reduced a lot as new patches come in)
-Toxic community at higher levels
-Hitboxes are the same for all champions, However sometimes they act really weird in registering 


Overall a very nice game and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys FPS games, It might not be that much of tactical game like CSGO or R6S. It leans more to the get in and kick ass style, But it is very enjoyable especially with friends where you can do ult combos and stuff together. 
"
26184,"every patch has a different line up of problems, so if you don't like it now, wait a month or 2. at least it's fun like less than TF2, but better than Overwatch."
26185,the game is amezog
26186,"its a good game if you born :)))))
"
26187,Awesome game where you can while away your time.
26188,So much hacker
26189,"I played this game a bit. got pissed off at how unbalanced some of the characters are, the number of bugs, the expensive skins that are pure fan service, and oh god the amount of furry's. in my pure rage I bought overwatch at full price, praying that I would get a better game. to my surprise they aren't that similar. this game is still good though."
26190,"Game is pure trash. A tank that stands there blocking all fucking damage the entire fucking round and is untouchable, very fun class love being able to do nothing in a fps game."
26191,"I don't really play the game that much nowadays but this is one of my favorite games ever, characters are pretty unique, everything visually amazing."
26192,Good and fun game.
26193,dead game
26194,its fun

26207,"Haven't come across a game-changing bug in many months, which used to be a real drawback. There are still some pesky graphical ones, especially on the home page, but other than that the game is in really good shape. Currently well balanced, with interesting and fun characters on some dynamic maps. The mechanics of the game has always been its best aspect for me. People will complain about comeback mechanic but it's balanced by credits gained for capturing objectives. By far the best mechanic though is all the in-game customization. Each champion can choose one of 3 legendary talents that provide a large buff to one of their basekit abilities, as well as a set of 5 cards with 15 cumulative levels that give smaller buffs to other parts of their kit (base or ability proc-based cooldown reduction, health increase, reload decrease, increased healing below certain health, etc). Additionally, credits earned in-game for objective time, kills, damage and healing allow one to buy items at spawn, which give specific utility for enemy obstacles. Enemy team has a lot of direct damage (snipers, blaster dps)? Each level of Haven is 7% dmg decrease. Enemy team has a lot of shields? Wrecker increases weapon dmg on shields by 20%. It's infinitely customizable and many playstyles for each champion are viable. On paper it's much better than OW, and in practice it's at least on par, especially considering it's a free game. Highly recommend!"
26208,good game tho ez bez
26209,"amazing FPS game similar to overwatch 
"
26210,i dont recommend this game because it has to many bugs and cheaters (on ranked games) and bad customer support

26250,Pretty decent for a free version of overwatch.
26251,hate this game. the source of my hysteria attacks and nightmares.
26252,"I got 600+ hours on this game lol, not including my other first account. However, Somehow on my old laptop (yeah, yeah I play on a laptop, still able to wreck you tho ;) ) it was able to play this game. My new laptop, that is literally at least three times faster, can't play this game, because "" lack of a graphics card and processor"". I downloaded Fortnite and was able to keep at least 60 fps the whole time ._. ."
26253,I have played this off and on with friends and by my self and even losing doesn't feel to bad since the matches are pretty evenly matched.
26254,"Before I played Paladins, I had a small penis, no friends, no girlfriend, depression, and absolutely no life. These things haven't changed, but the game is pretty good."
26255,Great game
26256,like overwatch
26257,yum
26258,"Absolute blast! Very much skill based, and really fun to customize and work with all types of characters and abilities!"
26259,"Me : Mom, can we have Overwatch ?
Mom : But son, we already have Overwatch

Overwatch at home :"
26260,Great F2P game.
26261,"More fun than overwatch since overwatch added the specific class type queuing. Quick tip, I played for an ungodly amount of time before I realised how buys cards worked, total game changer, just press I in the waiting lobby and its pretty simple stuff."
26262,its ok
26263,"Great fun to play especially since it's free, but does get boring very quickly. It's annoying you play against bots and low ranks to begin with...so boring!"
26264,goosd
26265,fun ass overwatch cone
26266,"One of the worst shittiest game ever created. After having almost 1000 hours let me tell you what's going to happen:

1..The game got shit tons of hackers and even if many report, the hirez community can't even look into the problems.

2. Matchmaking is terrible. This game is a Joke. I was matched with 2-3 bots+0 lvl and no lvl players who always want to play Vivian with that shit shield.
Seriously the game has no proper matchmaking. You will have 2-3 bots and the enemy's team will have good players.
I haven't won a single game since 3 days because I was always matched with 2-3 bots and 0lvl and no lvl players. I don't understand why people won't go to siege training first, they just jump off to ranked match or casual without knowing nothing.

3. Toxic players and too many kids who think they are pro's just after getting 2-3 kills.

4.toxic players blames on healers instead of protecting them and getting healed. 

5. Bugs. Bugs bugs. What a shit ton of bugs. They give thousands of shitty cringe worthy skins but not fixing the bugs.

Guys don't even think about playing this shitty ass game. This game is free and has many hackers like speed hack/ aimbot/ triggerbot. The anti cheat of this game is a big joke. Fuck hirez and their shit community.

Believe me the game was good Long back and many left due to shit responses from hirez.

Don't even think about spending cash on this game for skins and other stuffs. Hirez won't even give fuc for their players. 
"
26267,so good
26268,"Though it may say I have 60 hrs on steam, I have 1500+ hrs on the Switch, and I have quite a few things to say.

To start off, this game is NOT an Overwatch clone. It's easy to see that from the outside looking in, but once you play your first game, the differences between the two are like night and day. The advantage Paladins has over a game like Overwatch is the fact that each Champion can have a multitude of different playstyles. With Overwatch, each hero has one single playstyle, and that's it. 

Obviously a AAA title like Overwatch is going to be a lot more polished with next to no bugs, good graphics, and reliable servers. Paladins is on the other side of the coin when it comes to this. With quite a few bugs, above average graphics, and pretty bad servers. But what Paladins suffers in company backing, it excels in gameplay. The uniqueness of Paladins is the sole reason why I have played since mid-late 2018. Ask any Paladins player with over 500 hours in paladins how the feel about the game and what will they say? Something among the lines of; The servers are frustrating or the meta is sometimes dumb, but the game is just fun. 

The game might make me wanna kill myself at some points, and sometimes there are some rat players, but this game isn't one that I can just put down. 

"
26269,good game enjoyed it a lot
26270,"This game has a problem of sometimes being launched and not appearing anywhere but its running. The screen appears when i press ENTER+ALT which switches from window mode to fullscreen.

Everything else works like a charm but that problem is abit annoying."
26271,This game is filled with scumbags who can't play other fps games efficiently. Also don't try to play with a controller in this game unless you want it to randomly shut off movement for your character based on bugs.
26272,Has it's own uniqueness although personal preference would be Valorant / Apex Legends.
26273,_
26274,"Toxic playerbase, unbalanced champions and bugs everywhere. After 300 hrs I can't it anymore. Honestly this is the worst community I've had the displeasure of being apart of."
26275,"Very Fun, Very Friends, Only Play Casual"
26276,It's just mindless fun.
26277,ok
26278,Really Good :)
26279,game mechanics and graphics were good
26280,its a very good game better than overwatch
26281,Gud game lmao. Seriously tho its not an overwatch clone.
26282,"Pretty good game. I'm still a total beginner, but came from Overwatch so there's a few of the characters function similarly to Overwatch heroes - some almost exactly, some similar, some a mix of multiple characters in one. 

It is easy to pick up, with 20 hours play I'm already reasonably competent with 4 characters. Viktor (functions almost identical to Soldier 76), Seris (similar to Moira), Androxus (McCree meets Doomfist, looks like Reaper) and Tyra (female Soldier 76 mixed with Zen)

The big advantage of this game is that it's free, and it would run on a baked potato. Running at 1080p ultra @ 175fps, my GPU sits at around 35% usage. 

You would run this easily on integrated graphics, but it still has a nice charming look to it. 

And it is fun, loads of heroes to chose from, nice mix of game modes, decent maps that are really simple, colorful, and easy to learn. 

It's not as good or as polished as Overwatch, but it's fairly solid entertainment and different enough that it's not really  a case of playing one or the other."
26283,epic
26284,Best Free to play on pc
26285,its lovely game i loved it try it very postiveeeeeeeee
26286,its really arcade like. it has a very cathartic feel to it
26287,"In a word: Generic
----------------------

Is Team Fortress too old for you? Is Overwatch too expensive or you just don't feel like using another launcher? Well congratulations you found a free knock off that does the same thing as every other routine FPS team game.

You can debate over which game borrowed ideas from which, and it shares some passing resemblance with Global Agenda, just reskinned with less sci-fi elements and that wasn't a bad game either,

There's nothing terribly wrong with the game, but in the end they all just kind of blend together. If this had a price tag i might thumb it down, but it's free and if you are into this sort of thing it's probably at least worth looking at to see if you want this option."

26289,Its actually a pretty good alternative to overwatch lmao
26290,Definitely worth playing if you're a fan of arena shooters
26291,fun
26292,i love this game
26293,"Hard to grind , gold reward is funny low"
26294,"worst game in the store, cant even launch the damn game just keeps crashing, don't bother downloading, this needs fixing!! was a good game for the very few matches that i got to play, other than that i launch the game and it immediately crashes, its pretty shit aye
"
26295,its great
26296,Much better than overwatch
26297,im genuinely so sad its not on mac os ahhhh
26298,Fun game small community don't understand why people are so toxic in such a small community doesn't really encourage new players to play. But it is a very fun game.
26299,"Somehow managed to get worse over the years. The movement and aiming feels absolutely terrible. Play literally any other free fps game. Paladins may be a fun break from whatever fps you're getting your ""fix"" on, but you will very quickly realize that the grass is not at all greener on the other side. Dogs won't even shit on this grass.

EDit: Having friends makes the game more fun but then you run into sweats who are level 500 plus because match making it pretty bad can't avoid sweats who think its all about ranked. I'd give it a plus as I love the card system and the updating to the game but overall I still can't. Now they want to release new Champs too fast in my opinion when balance is already an issue. New people always give problems and they take long to fix it as it is."

26364,I recently returned and it looks great! Kinda sad that they removed payload though. I would still recommend if you're looking to play fast games. I just hope the devs balance it out a little more. Buck and Kinessa need some rework.

I played too much at this game and after 475 hours of playing (Steam stats) i can finally say that ""Overwatch"" is absolutely a different game. This is more stategical than ""Overwatch"" and in my honest opinion really more funny. Oh right... This game is Free. Even the Battle Pass can be ""brought"" using gems that you can collect in the game and this is a game that if you play you can collect the gems necessary quickly.

26403,BETTER THAN OVERWATCH
26404,the game is fun. thats all
26405,"I ignored Paladins since it was known as the poor man's Overwatch, but after trying it for the first time in 2020 I am legit impressed and shocked that it's not like Overwatch at all. In a lot of ways, it's better.

Time of death is longer so it gives you more time to react and counterplay, ultimates feel more impactful and the ability to customize your skills to fit certain playstyles or team comps adds a welcome layer of depth. 

It's less FPS skill heavy and emphasizes more on positioning and ability use from MOBA gameplay."
26406,"Have you ever wanted to play a MOBA/FPS and also pop a huge boner? Then this is the game for you. What are you in to? Boobs? This game has you covered. Butts? Definitely. You a furry? Yea that too. Do you like dragons? yea we've got those. Are you in to girls made out of rock? Well guess what this game has. 

7/10, Io makes me uncomfortable. Matchmaking could be better."
26407,Bad
26408,"Fun Game just riddled with bugs and the removed the play of games which honestly is one of the worst decisions they made...

Its been 4 years since i 1st started playing paladins on PS4 its still fun game but play of the game needs to be added back to the game, and hitbox sizes need to be reduced and the game will be perfect for me."
26409,better than paladins in game meta and gameplay in my opinion
26410,"overwatch but fun and everyone is tadpoles so its easy to get good at
"
26411,Overall it is a pretty good game with annoying teamates. I personally enjoy Paladins more than Overwatch but ranked is hell cause of your teammates not knowing how to play or coordinate most of the time.
26412,very good
26413,sure
26414,i only played it today for so 3 ouers and a half but i love the game play and the constand shooting and action. I would recommend this game to someone that loves alot of ation

26425,It's a nice game. Need more support and players!
26426,This game used to be fun and now its full of hackers hell their are a ton of videos on YT on how to used mods and they do nothing about it..... how pathetic do you have to be to hack on this game?

26431,GG
26432,most premium
26433,"Honestly this Game needs a LOT of work to be at its fullest potential,like There are many WIP maps that have been around for a long time and i feel that making at least one or two an actual map with an interesting atmosphere would improve the game because there are some maps that just arent good,But there are some good things about this game its not purely bad,There are some great champions that are fun to play but The match making system isnt that good because when i play quick-play matches i play against very high level people and it seems too hard at times.This game is Very Fun but if Hi-Rez can fix these things (and a couple other things not listed) it would improve the game drastically."
26434,fun game to play with friends
26435,ummm.... Good Game.
26436,not funny didn't laugh
26437,"I mean it's good, worth your money, especially since it's free
"
26438,amazin game play
26439,This is like the only game that I am actually good at mostly because literally everyone who plays it runs it on a windows 95 calculator. Play Paladins if you miss the feeling of going outside and punching a paper bag.
26440,good game to play when bored
26441,lol
26442,free overwatch
26443,10/10 ign
26444,"good game overall, a bit toxic but like no one talks in chat in pubs, also people LOVE to ruin your fun, for exampe, op characters with op perks, and upgrades that make it even more op, and volturing, and stun volturing, and being maeve, and being auto aim, you get it."
26445,"Paladins is alright. The animations are terrible. The game is terribly unbalanced. But, all around it's fun to play. I feel like HY-REZ should probably focus on this game a little bit more, but, I know they won't."
26446,"Pretty fun. Biggest complaint is there are alot more trolls then normal, and long waiting times. Id say the game is good, but the community is shit."
26447,"Honestly, it's better than overwatch but it's completely free. Champions feel great and I love that we can customize champs for various builds. Every champion can be played in different ways or the same with subtle differences. In game items allows us to adapt to what the enemy team is playing, for example you can choose to break shields better or to dampen healing. Fun game, think it should get more credit!"
26448,f
26449,Stun mechanics. I hate the stun mechanics
26450,"They ruined this gem ;(, a champion every fucking week"
26451,"nice  game
"
26452,"good replacement for overwatch
however, it'd be better if characters were more balanced and teammates didn't forget we should work as a TEAM, especially on ranked games."
26453,"This game is just pure fun, it's not that competitive which wouldn't be a problem but because of that it's a fun game to play with your friends"
26454,Kinda a overwatch copy but if you dont have overwatch its a good alternative. its a good game just not for me
26455,Overwatch On Mobile 4/10
26456,"good in graphic, smooth gameplay, creative power for each different heroes..."
26457,it's a nice replacement for overwatch

26459,it is good game for mac user
26460,Such a Fun Competition Game

26473,nice
26474,"budget overwatch

"
26475,"Good game, alot of champions to choose from and very addicting."
26476,"It's like overwatch, but better. Champions actually feel fun to play as, where with Overwatch I feel like I'd have to spend ages trying to learn to actually be able to have fun. Playing off-role is pretty viable, especially for support characters, which is fun, and it has the all-important aspect of being able to customize how your character works."
26477,best game i ever played
26478,"Great free to play game, no play to win makes it even bettter"
26479,"garbage game 
some class too much powerful they can 1v5"
26480,"I've really enjoyed Paladins. I feel likes its unfair to downvote this game as a Overwatch rip-off as each hero is customizable in a way that makes even two people play the same hero seem vastly different. Plus, it's free!!"

26497,8/10 very nice and no longer f2p friendly
26498,good game
26499,"I enjoy the action and characters in this game more so than a certain more well known Hero Shooter. My only gripe is there is no way to access or purchase individual skins from previous battle passes. The skins are shown, but not accessible. If there was a way to get certain individual skins that I prefer I think I would enjoy this game more. If there is a way to acquire the Damned Frontier/Wild West Battle pass skins, please share cause short of going back in time there seems to be no way to get these."
26500,very fun game to play
26501,i play snake boi and its fun to like sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss all over the floor ykyk
26502,"A somewhat shallow but enjoyable class-based shooter with light-tectics goal-focused modes that seems to suffer a bit from a balance/pacing issue as matches snowball hard either way - however, with the rare saving grace in 2020 gaming where the more unbalanced a match is, the faster it ends. The fastest queue times of any online game I've seen so far also ensure that a badly-paired match is going to be a minor bump only.

To testify that this is not an ""everyone gets a participation prize"" proposal but a no-skill-ceiling experience, I myself (a veteran but rusty FPS player) have, in 2 hours of playtime, gotten no less than 4 Achievements that only half or a third of the playerbase have unlocked. I'm interested to see if the ranked mode adds more depth to the matches, given more appropriate skill-based matchmaking. At current rate I'd assume it'll take 6 hours total to unlock it.

Monetization seems to be built around only cosmetics and unlocking heroes - the latter being doable with in-game currency too or by a reasonable one-time payment of a fraction of an AAA game title's price to own all present and future champions. In these 2 hours I seem to have gained enough gold to unlock between 1-4 of the heroes, depending on their prices. Assuming hero prices have no bearing on power, it's safe to say this isn't pay-to-win.

Playing Paladins, I couldn't help but mourn how far from the best entries of the genre from back in the 90s (and their later descendants) we've fallen, in favor of dumbed-down, handholding, mass-appealing titles that pale in comparison in any and all types of online competition. If like me, however, you've seen your old favorites' servers die down with every year, Paladins is more than capable of offering an alternative that is a free, fast, skill-based, minimally-strategic FPS with a healthy community around it. 

Fans of MOBAs who are tired of enforced metas, pandering to the lowest-common-denominators of skill segments, draconic or senseless game design, infuriating matchmaking and inadequate community moderation may also find the class-based approach here an interesting proposal, as a different but similar type of mostly-action, minimally-brainy pastime."
26503,it is a meme but it is fun

26530,"A free clone of Overwatch, although it was developed before the official announcement of Overwatch. But the game is not bad, I played Over, and I personally liked Paladins more. If there is a bias in Auvers, as for me it is more about the action and the shooter component, then the matches in Paladins are measured tactful rounds, here it is for taste and color. The graphics are noticeably inferior to Over, but despite this, in the Paladins it is kind of ... more comfortable and calm or something, again, taste. Paladins and the special skill chosen at the beginning of the round and the customization of character cards that will make your hero unique make it more tactful.
I quit the game due to the fact that it is not developing as fast as before, gradually losing content, because developers are not able to maintain something and fix some bugs, it is easier for them to cut something.
You can play, but this is too amateurish game .."

Imagine if they had decided to make it  both free and generally a better game with regular support from the devs, a more fulfilling back lore, and character design that is believable and fits better into the world while also not being afraid to show a bit of fan service. While not a perfect game by any means, when I choose to play a team based shooter, my friends and I all choose Paladins."

26547,"It's a fun and casual hero shooter. It's simple on its surface but has a lot of complexity once you learn the basics. The card loadout system and in game shop are where most of the strategy comes from. I have almost 100 hours in it and have experienced very few, if ANY game-breaking bugs so I don't get where a lot of those complaints come from. Would recommend for anyone looking for something different from TF2 or Overwatch."
26548,fuck this review platform just let me give this game a thumbs up

26550,its an easy game to play and if you want something like overatch but cant afford overwatch this is the game to play
26551,copy cat but still fun. it just needs to be more creative
26552,"Its alright, I enjoy the pacing of the rounds but it isn't the greatest game I have ever played
"
26553,fun
26554,good game if its your first time playing FPS
26555,"Worst game I have ever played, some how more unbalanced than R6S and COD combined, if you enjoy games don't play this at all."
26556,Great Game if you're looking for a overwatch kinda game

26560,I was quite amazed with the tactics and talents of every champions/character/avatar. There are too many talents or types of 1 specific character which makes me enjoy so much. I can do Support or damage  depending on the line up and team play was really needed for these game.
26561,Very unique game
26562,"Awesome game, fun to play but could use more game modes"
26563,"Love the game, instead of all champions pack would prefer packs for single champions:
1 champion
1 skin
1 weeapon skin
some gems and some gold"

26566,"pretty good to play, same platform as overwatch but different content,  alil slow in champ creation but its not that much of a problem best to play with friends"
26567,"Well.. it's fun to play this game untill a bug comes in and just Demolish everything. I hate it when the game crashes sometimes, rest is fine.."
26568,"I HATE THIS GAME SO MUCH I CAN. I LOST MY ACCOUNT, ALREADY TRIED WITH SIGNING IN HI REZ WEBSITE STILL CAN'T GET TROUGH. EVEN I TRY TO MAKE A NEW ACCOUNT, MY DLC CAN'T BE DETECTED. SKIPPPPPPPPPPPPP"
26569,"This is the first game I've played that is FPS/hero shooter and it is SO much fun. Pretty easy to catch on.

I will say my only complaint is that I am playing this on pc with an xbox controller plugged-in so it doesn't always translate well to the controller, but I adjusted pretty quickly."
26570,it is fun free and diffrent
26571,nice
26572,this is one of the best games ever
26573,"It's buggy, it's laggy, it's overmonetized. But at least they didn't censor HK. And it's fun!"
26574,"I like this game a lot better than Overwatch. More character diversity and being able to choose your own loadout and mix things up is simply amazing. You can take one character and build them a ton of other ways which can completely chance your gameplay. Maps are better than in other Hero Shooters, and there are a lot of them. Paladins is much more Gameplay focused than OW and less linear when it comes to characters."
26575,"This game is similar to Overwatch but more of a controlled pace. Open role select which is preferred so that you can play whatever role you'd like. However, the matchmaking can be sometimes poor and often results in very one sided games 4-0."
26576,"i have been playing this game since the beta on PS4 and it was the base champions and this game was still in the works for sure, but i adore this game i have gotten every person i game with to try this game and they all fell in love with it like i did. it truly is a game that if you work together you are most likely to do really well and i hope to be streaming this game at some point! also the amount of skins for the champions are insane as well!"

26594,trash
26595,this game was good about 3 years ago but the devs are taking out good things and only adding ugly ass skins to compinsate.
26596,"This game is fantastic....when you can play it.

I've played Paladins since early beta and completely fell in love with the characters. gameplay, and overall customization it gave me. Paladins has always been seen as a lesser Overwatch, which sadly has some truth to it. However, I'd like to think of Paladins as Overwatch's only competitor. There's just one problem. The game tends to just give up on life after only a few matches. 
THIS 
GAME
WILL
NOT
STOP
CRASHING
hell, as I write this, my game won't even load. It just gives up and dies before I can even see the boot screen. Just yesterday I played for a total of 3 hours before the game crashed 7 times. Twice on the character select, one mid match, one from entering the training range, and the rest were on the main menu. This is unacceptable
I really love this game, but until I can actually play it without crashing every other match, I cannot give it a good rating."

26602,Nul
26603,Best fake Overwatch
26604,It's fun but damn its fucking stupid how many bugs it has.
26605,"was fun like 2-3 years ago, its golden age is over.
i cannot find fun in this game anymore, the balance is fucked, the servers are fucked, the champions are fucked, everything i enjoyed in this game has been removed or altered in a bad way
for example i mained sha lin, they removed his shifting sands legendary card which was fun and was pretty okay to play with, they gave flankers pocket nukes , they made fat flankers that cant move , they contradict everything they set out for themselves, FLANKERS ARE FAST , HIGH BURST CHAMPIONS WITH DISCRETE MOMENTS OF IMMENSE SURVIVABLITY, lex grounded, has a slide,

Ranked matchmaking is trash, u cannot open this game as a new player and have a good time , sure when u play with bots its okay, as soon as u will hit lvl 5 u get matched with real people and those real people are usually grandmasters smurfing, smurfing is too much of a problem in this game, the ranked reward system is bad, u can do all the dmg and support in a game and get points but the guy who played like a brainded monkey still gets the same points as you,
too many hitscan champions, my boy drogoz cant even fly, there is a choice of illusion, you cant play a champion more than 2 ways despite being unlimited combinations


edit: 
after thinking a long time i decided i was too harsh, yes this might be a shitshow of bad decision after bad decision but still it has some redeeming qualities so if u can put up with ocassional bad connection, bad bots,and a plethora of bugs, u can give this a try"
26606,"Invested way too much time into this game, made a purchase and suddenly got fantastic games in ranked, after awhile I simply got loss after loss even though I'd played more and gotten better. Really shocked but 1 day i was silver, made a purchase and a week later platinum 1, a few months after the purchase I literally can't climb out of silver again."
26607,fun
26608,"Great game to play with friends and be competitive about. I highly recommend it for a couple of playing sessions and the crossplay is truly a beautiful thing. Theres things I dont like like the lootboxes and paywall for skins and customization but yeah, overall a great game."
26609,"extremely buggy, many issues will never get fixed because of lack of resources. it's fun if you don't play seriously"
26610,"very intresting and have a hot online gameplay u wont dissapointed if u install only graphic lvl hurts a little

26631,"since i played quite a lot,i can say this game is not bad,they have good skins, interesting heroes, but there are no changes often (don't expect new maps, only skins, re-skins), sometimes interface changes,game have bugs often on new battle pass, and they fix them very slow, as if they don't play own game, you can see how much i played and to be honest i'm bored, they add skins but not maps, they have mode were you can play tested maps without textures on walls and they never added any  new map(only 1 re-skin after a year), they add only skins and interface changes on battle pass themes, it can be okay to play a bit as it is f2p and they got cool wifu and now even premium bp and good skins you can get while playing without paying, but i feel bored, maybe its age , or because they need to leave game play constant without changes for the sake of tournaments but to be honest for casual players there should be more diversity and new views around, like you don't just play to win , but you also should like were you fight . These old maps are old and feel ugly."
26632,this game has nice player models ;)
26633,fun game
26634,"It's a pretty good game I like it and can run on lower end pcs, which is GREAT. Better than overwatch imo, because it's free, but as in every game, those fucking idiots who don't do shit the whole match and just stay in your base are in this game as well, I suggest y'all add a report button for that damn it."

26642,"I played this game for over 3 years now, I experienced every little bug that existed and tolerated it, because I am in love with the style of Paladins, the system (class, cards), and even the lore that I even started to write a fanfition of it.
But now after Hi-Rez/ Evil Mojo decided to bring this game to Epic games as well it got unplayable, like in casuals you get harassed for having fun, if you say "" dud chill it's casual not ranked"" they totally get toxic and report ya, now I got my first ban for 24 hours and I am totally done.
Not that the actual update reminds me of OB64 (search it on youtube it is THE meme of paladins) not with the pay2win, that got removed as it should be but it is soooo buggy I have no fun anymore the playerbase is totally annoying and the support of them is trash.
I asked for the reason of my ban and in every support ticket they said, we dont know why you got banned.

So Evil Mojo/ Hi-rez/ New players, I am really struggling on continuing playing this game but if it stay like this I won't change my mind and recommend everyone to NOT play it, you only get disappointed!"
26643,"Muito Divertido, Pena que esta muito desbalanceado os herois"

26664,"This game is just astonishing, I've played since beta and have really enjoyed the game,

If you're into high speed action games and generally want a fast paced game, this is the perfect one for you, bugs used to be a huge problem back in beta but they were funny to see (getting sent out of orbit etc.) and my personal experience has been the best.

It's extremely addictive to play, especially with friends, the ranked mode is fun and competitive and casual is a great way to train etc.

You can also make custom games to train and test out new champions and the AI is programmed well,

The bugs are minor and the customization is out of the roof.

I personally would give the game a 9.6/10, it's free to play, play to win and is really enjoyable to kill time,

If you're reading this and you haven't given the game a go yet, you should go for it, trust me, you won't regret it.

You have the opportunity to make the most popular game of this year. The class are fun and diverse there is SO MUCH POTENTIAL just fix the crashes please.

Also it is often compared to TF2... IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN TF2"

26672,"“Paladins” is a free cooperative FPS developed and published by the well-known Hi-Rez Games. ""Paladins"" drew attention for its similarity to the bombastic and celebrated ""Overwatch"", however the game still manages to have an independence and bring different qualities.

A very interesting initial information that should be stressed is that “Paladins” is entirely in Portuguese, making it a great facility and attractive for the Brazilian public.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2236024259

Like most MMOs and MOBAs, “Paladins” offers reward scores, skills and coins to people who enter the game every day.

Five servers are also available to choose from: North America, Europe, Australia, Asia and Brazil. Being another great attraction for the national audience that is interested in playing and easily finding other Brazilian players.

The game features four options for modes to play. The casual, which is a four against four battle of domination and taking the cart to a certain point, the competitive one, which is blocked, which is to conquer and do certain challenges, the training to improve and perfect your techniques and the personalized where you can choose the number of players and the style of play.

“Paladins”, like all MOBA, presents characters with functions for the player to choose which one suits him best. We have several champions, in this case the characters that are playable, divided between different functions. Each character has their specific abilities according to their function, which will be better explained later.

Support: One of the classic functions of the entire MOBA. Its total mission is to support the team, increasing the amount of life and improving the quality of skills. They are fast characters, who must stay away from the center of attacks, even though they have some ranged attack skills. His main skills are healing and restoration, as well as being able to hinder, or even attack, enemies.

Tank: The strongest and toughest character in the game. Your main mission is to go ahead to the attack zone and try to eliminate as many enemies as possible. His life is very long, managing to take a lot of damage. They are slow and stocky characters, and can attack, most of the time, close to the enemy. Good parts of the characters can also create a shield for defense, both from him and from some point that must be protected. His main skills are attacking, having a defense.

Damage: Your main mission on the battlefield is to eliminate enemies. Their skills are focused exclusively on attacks and skills that help to create and improve the attack strategy. Your defensive ability, if you can say so, is an aid to escape some intense battle, until you regain your life. They are not the strongest characters, but can handle a battle. Their speed varies a lot depending on the chosen champion, but they are agile in general. It is possible to use stealth skills to surprise opponents.

Flank: They are fast characters, who must attack from the flanks, as the class name already says, without being much noticed. Your skills have a lot of focus on teleporting, increasing speed, reaching higher places with faster and faster and more direct attacks. They are extremely fast and stealthy. It is an important class to help attack or defend without being noticed, dying very little.

A good number of roles, often occurring a certain imbalance between them, especially when certain champions are chosen.

Each champion had five skills, for defense, attack and special, being molded from the class belonging to the champion.

The skills that the game offers are very pleasant and diverse. Characters with the same functions on the battlefield have completely different abilities, thus being able to make the player closer, attached and satisfied to the player with a specific champion. This distinction between skills also makes the battle system less monotonous.

The game provides a system to create an arsenal of improvements to your card-based skills. The player can choose five cards to be the basis for improving the champion's skills, which can be improved even more during a match. It is an interesting system, which allows the player to create a better strategy for his game, however the cards are still of little choice, perhaps there is still a little more constructive creativity to create more specific cards that give the player more excitement. -over there.

Until then, the most popular mode of the game is casual, matches between teams of four against four.

Each player must choose a champion, who will stay with him until the end of the game, unlike other FPS Online where you can change characters at any time. It's a somewhat arr ideabaited and that holds the player very much to his initial choice, mainly the beginners who are still learning about the champions, however the way to improve their skills during a match, leaves less submissive.

The team is given two goals. The first is to achieve a certain point, staying in the place as long as possible, before the other team. The other is to be able to take, or not let the other team take, a cart to another point.

These two simple goals cause a good tension between the teams, if they manage to organize themselves well and choose the right characters. Simplicity is a correct choice, as the matches are direct, fast and very objective, without having to do a lot of crazy things or dilemmas, and a simple organization is enough.

One cannot help comparing “Paladins” with “Overwatch”, even though both have their specific qualities and defects. One of the big differences between the two is the construction of the maps by the developers. While the Blizzard shooter risks a lot on the maps, with big differences between them and points to make its strategies, the Hi-Rez shooter has its weakest point on the maps, having a very similar construction always, looking like it is always playing the same .

This problem with the maps in “Paladins” makes the game extremely monotonous after playing for a while. There comes a time when the player can no longer bear all the resemblance, looking like he is always playing the same thing in every new game.

In this case, due to the question that they want to bring simple and easy-to-understand objectives for the players, in a correct way, the maps should be the opposite, with different environments, points for hidden player or going into direct battle, and not just a repetition of ideas. One of the worst, if not the worst, ""Paladins"" point - which can be corrected over time.

The graphics are quite acceptable. They focus a lot on the idea of ​​less is more, without great details and realism, but with plenty of colors and nothing that makes players uncomfortable or complaining about visual defects.

The environments, although always similar, are very beautiful too, leaving a very hostile and pleasant battlefield.

The interface of a MOBA FPS is difficult to do, because any detail that is exaggerated."
26673,"Kinda like an Overwatch, but more fun, free to play, and easier to learn. The characters are much easier to learn and use as well"
26674,"|This game is terrible. lot of Stupid braindeads that have less IQ than Apes. the game crashes every few hours for no reasons. Game is full of toxic kids. i got banned for 7 days for typing in chat some guy's name. sh!t game, terrible piece of sh!t"

26679,keeps crashing
26680,"when compared to games such as overwatch or tf2 i can agree the game feel unrefind in some situations the loading screen is not pretty on the eyes and most if the skins dont even have backrounds, most if not all the skins are never worth buying for there crazy price and most of the woman are sexualized but if you can look past alot of the none gameplay flaws it is a pretty solid game a definelty one i would tryout"
26681,its like a free ovetrwatch

26689,"Its easy to play and a good de-stressor
"
26690,"Please, bring back the play of the game feature. Besides it adds a little bit flair of the game, it gives the players motivation to finish a match. Since the feature was removed, the game's been bland as hell. I don't really mind if the play of the game bugs sometimes, as long as I we have that motivation to do well in the game.
"
26691,overall great game
26692,"nice game
"
26693,CEL MAI TARE
26694,"Pretty fun to play, Been playing for a very long time is pretty addictive there are many people claiming that is bugged and it can't be playable I can say that not true I been here for more than 3 years and I can say I haven't had any bug related problem so far. I recommend it"
26695,"Within 2 days of playing i ran into so many bugs it's unplayable. Black screens after matches that cant be fixed without restarts, getting stuck on the login screen and cant fix it without a reinstall, getting stuck on 0 on the countdown going into matches, multiple crashes. Very big let down because the game is pretty fun to play outside the ridiculous amounts of bugs"
26696,decent free to play game
26697,"It's basically free Overwatch, but with more balanced heros. The game has multiple different heros and each one of them has a new and fun play style. There is something for everyone in this game. One thing I really liked was the market system, because you can't just switch heros, instead you can just use that to counter others. Lastly I love that everything can be obtained through in game mechanics. No real money is needed to unlock everything."
26698,"Terrible matchmaking. Matches are so one sided, unlocking new champions is definitely a grind, as I've played for over 3 hours and got pretty much nothing for it. Probably has P2W matchmaking systems in place. To ensure that you'll stay in their rigged matchmaking, they don't have the option of leaving the match. You have to close the game and wait. If you reopen the game too soon, it'll throw you right back into that bad match.

The game is buggy as heck and it's prone to freezing and crashing, despite being played on decent gaming hardware. i7, GTX 1050, 16GB RAM.

If it didn't have bugs, crashes, stupid long grind, and bad matchmaking... the game would of been fun."
26699,One of the games that are very accessible to new players. On the opposite end of this spectrum is DOTA.
26700,:)
26701,it game
26702,this game is fun you will feel like you played it for a month but u will realize your just playing it for a day great for removing depression temporary because there is no one voice chat/chatting in this game the game is really suspense and has a lot of cool characters the game is not pay to win you just need some skill and months of playtime and you will get good with it playing this with your friends are really recommended its much more fun when you play with your friends
26703,its ok
26704,"10/10, the funnest free game I've played. constantly active, with frequent updates. great customization so you can meet your play style. lots of hours can be sunk into the game and it never loses it's fun."
26705,Nice teamsetting
26706,"Very good game. Played a little bit and already think it is my favorite free game. Not pay to win and every character is worth playing and getting good at. Better than Overwatch in every way but graphics. Not that many QUALITy players, so join up and become a legend."
26707,grinding is super fun tbh

26714,"[h1]Paladins a fun game to play with a few friends. BUT. Still to this date a buggy, laggy, unfinished mess. Its impossible to play this game seriously and even when just playing ""casualy"" its frustrating and messy.[/h1]

[b]Hitboxes, headshots, and aiming feels slugish and is extremely inconsistant. Latency seems to be a huge problem[/b] - having close intense combats is very weird and hits sometimes take a few moments to appear. 

[b]TONS and TONS of bugs and glitches.[/b] Have not had a single playing session without [b]visual bugs[/b] such as one player not showing what cards they picked; beeing in a party and not actualy joining the que with them; not beeing able to pick a hero in champselect; not seeing what your alies pick in champselect; crashes at the start of a match - not able to rejoin; getting stuck in objects on the map; etc (dont remember all of them^^)
Sometimes [b]matchmaking feels kind of unbalanced[/b] having to play against 3 people with some hero at lvl200+ and getting completely annihilated.

As I mentioned before its [b]still fun[/b]; great variety of playstyles with cards, decks, ingame Items and pretty cool map designs.
Overall the problems above make this game [b]frustrating to play,[/b] by still sqeezing a few laughts out with my friends here and there.

Its a pleasure with friends - if not of the bugs."

26722,yessir
26723,grat game
26724,yes
26725,"This game is so good, i would recomend getting this game it is just Incredible!"
26726,"Interesting concept, but a very easy game. Takes mere hours to master a character and memorise all the details of a map (not too much variety on that front). My biggest issue is the matchmaking, I got calibrated to gold because the matchmaking dice roll gave me vegetables as teammates for the games I've lost. After climbing with friends to diamond the game told me I am no longer allowed to play with more than one friend as a premade (only duoqueue) on diamond rank. Having two friends greatly reduced the RNG that is matchmaking, the worst case scenario being two vegetables in my team, but apparently on high ranks your teammates should only be decided by the matchmaking dice roll. The online in this game is pretty bad, check out on steam stats for the numbers. All in all, it's a pretty cheap knock-off of overwatch which, despite being F2P, seems more dead than Overwatch is. I have had games where I got the same teammates/enemies three times in a row in matchmaking."
26727,"Remove all the bugs, rest is pretty good. Fun and casual- some champions are OP so they are easier to play and try to avoid the unbalanced/  nerfed champions"
26728,this game is amazing and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to play something like overwatch but for free. This isnt a bad game at all!!!!!!!!!!
26729,Yes.
26730,d
26731,its still the best game i ever play
26732,1
26733,I mostly played this back when I was 11 but me and my friend had amazing times playing this game and for people who havent tried it id definitely recommend it! especially if you are looking for a free to play game
26734,kopkopko
26735,Yah
26736,I Like This Game is Kinda a Mix of Overwatch and other Games in this style But Better! I Would Really Recommend Buying it and Trying it Out

Kinda get boring sometimes

26739,"Its a fun game, good game based technologies. But the game is quite buggy. You can somethimes shoot through walls or have laggspikes randomly. Not recommended for easily offended people"
26740,A fun game to play with friends
26741,"really fast pace gameplay, and small queue times which is great"
26742,removal of third person? im out
26743,garbage
26744,"Fun, competitive game!! The only thing i can say about the game is play with friends, especially if you play ranked. Going in solo will almost always end in a loss."
26745,"They don't balance anything in this game, if a character is released broken it will stay broken. There is also 0 skill matchmaking what-so-ever in this game. BALANCE YOUR FUCKING GAME!!!!!"
26746,Fun objective-based first-person and I would strongly recommend. I no longer play this game at the time of review.
26747,so much fun for people who like both warframe and COD
26748,mmmm so gooooood booi

26752,"I have to write as someone with experience with Overwatch. In short, I think Paladins is a much more unique and fresh perspective. I also don't think that is a 1:1 comparison though because they are radically different games. Paladins is almost a hero shooter mixed with a moba, whereas Overwatch is the traditional hero shooter. There are a few major differences that I think make Paladins the better game, primarily the following:

1) Each individual character is super customizable. The card system makes can radically change playstyle, and during the match you can buy items much like a moba. The cards generally alter your main weapons and skills in some way (faster reload, adding health, speeding up skill recharges, etc) making different builds feel pretty different in game. You also pick 1 of 3 major skill changes at the beginning of the match. For example, Viktor can heal while sprinting, shoot his rifle in burst mode, or have really improved grenades. So there's a lot to unpack here that make the playstyle different.

2) Matches feel a bit shorter than OW, and maps are much smaller. While you'll find long LOS opportunities in OW, they aren't really there in Paladins. Maps are much more crowded and it makes the action faster. You even have mounts to get you back to the action quicker.

3) There's an enormous roster of heroes here. And a lot of skins. It's fun, I have played a handful and there is a lot of variety. They generally fill traditional hero shooter roles (Frontline, Damage, Flanker, and Support) and each role has over 10 heroes. Just a lot to play around with and they all feel different.

4) On PC, I haven't waited long to play a match. Like 15 second wait times for a game at 5am. That's cool, because I often play at weird hours.

I do think there are some flaws. It clearly isn't a AAA title, and you can tell sometimes. The game can be buggy. Communication is a little hard (I think I'm spoiled from Apex). On PC you might have to edit the keybindings so you're comfortable, but overall I think it's a really good experience. 

This title breathes a lot of fresh air into the genre, and is legitimately an incredible game. I've enjoyed playing around with the skills of the heroes I like (so far Khan, Viktor and my fave so far- Grohk)."
26753,Its Essentaily Overwatch But Free
26754,good
26755,super gierka fajnie ze moge pograc w paladinsy z moim najlepszym przyjacielem

26766,overall good game and nothing else to say
26767,I enjoy it. It's great.
26768,It's alright...
26769,I like this game because it engages you with challenges along with amazing game play. i would definitely would recommend this game to anyone any age because its fun to play and fun to learn.
26770,"Fuck this game! CHEATERS, CHEATERS, CHEATERS, CHEATERS, CHEATERS, AND CHEATERS!
Anticheat sucks
I very love this game, but I delete it. 
It is impossible to play if you are an honest player, either download cheats (which I didn’t do) or endure or delete the game"
26771,nice
26772,"REALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY fun game i 100% recommend it to anyone who is looking for a  FREE fast-paced Overwatch-like game .  In my opinion  it's actually such better and more fun than overwatch. Aaaaand , guess what ! YOU ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE TO GRIND ALL DAY TO GET SOMETHING GOOD LIKE OTHER GAMES ! I'TS ACTUALLY REALLY EZ  AND FAST TO GET GOOD , EVEN VERY GOOD NOR GREAT CHAMPIONS !!!!!!! AND IT'S SUUPER EZ TO PLAY AND UNDERSTAND THE GAME ASWELL !"

26778,I guess its fun to play with friends who cant afford to get paid multiplayer games.
26779,"The whole program is unstable, too buggy. It feels just like a high school project.
"
26780,"its fun but full of bugs
"
26781,"many people are gonna say..(this is the poor man's overwatch), tf2 died for me, and this is the close thing to the chaos of what TF2 was, even tho it has no season events, at least it has skins for the event's, it my refreshment after leaving TF2, BTW be aware of the unbalance."
26782,game is fun and all but the match making system is bad i always get incompetent and level boosted teamates while the other team gets higher level players but the game is very good its kinda tiring to loose every match because of bad players in team
26783,LIKE OVERWATCH JUST FREE
26784,"Probably one of the best free games available on the market, if you like Overwatch but you want it for free, this is your game. So it's not as polished as Overwatch, but it holds it's own and all the characters are fun to play.

And yes, there is an option to purchase all the characters but you can level up the good old fashioned way to earn coins to unlock them all, but if that is too much to ask, the game automatically rotates the characters around so you can have an opportunity to play new ones that you havent unlocked which is great for beginners. 

I highly recommend this game."
26785,"cool game, cool heroes. some are a little too girly for my taste but whatever. completely free unless you want hero skins, etc"
26786,trash

26788,"Solid game that is preferable to Fortnite or Overwatch, TF2 is still the master race"
26789,"0.


"
26790,its really fun and all the characters are fun to play the only bad thing about it is how it launches where i cant leave the app unless i close it and it can be very glitchy also having good graphics is pretty much impossible on laptop and mine is quite high quality and even with bad settings it lags a little but that might be a understatement because i live in Australia and they don't have very good internet but overall it's great :).
26791,Good yes

26796,"The game's just kind of fun. Has a lot of different dynamics, unlockable movesets, fun and efficient movement, and a satisfying game loop. Not a perfect game, but if you wanna sit down and crack open a cold one with some buddies you can't get much better than Paladins."

26815,This garbage games is always crashing
26816,"Paladins is a game I have a love-hate relationship with. There are many things to love, and also hate so I'll explain some of it. 

Pros: 
-Nice characters
-Unique abilities
-Free To Play
-Cross-play
-Cards for better abilities and items you can buy in match. 
-Fairly-nice community
-Beautiful skins
-Hours of fun
-New characters frequently

Cons:
-Bugs, bugs and more bugs. There are so many bugs, some are worse that others, and it is difficult for the devs to fix due to bad initial programming.
-Some characters are ridiculously overpowered, some having auto-aim abilities.
-Big Hitboxes.
-Joining and creating party issues.

Final Review: Paladins is a fun game, and if you can work past some of the minor inconveniences, you are in for a fun time.

"
26817,haha funny poop
26818,Its a fun team shooter to play with some friends
26819,"I love this game very much it inspired me to quit elementary school and follow my dreams of being a twitch streamer i have already gained 3 followers and i believe that if I try to become a pro at paladins i will be successful, thank you for creating this awesome game that i enjoy very much to play with my drug abusing dad. It has also saved my future marriage."

26821,"An interesting game especially since it's free, So it cool."

26831,"Good game,  big time sink though. I hated the throwing teams but in the long run, you adapt. Everyone throws matches at some point but this game is a huge time sink so I'm going on a long break.  I clocked over 900 hrs on Ps4."
26832,really great game.. amazing idea
26833,garbage ass game sweaty white boys
26834,Don't bother downloading this game. Off-brand Overwatch

26841,BETTER THEN overwatch :3
26842,"game is solid, casual queue times are very fast gets you right into the action unlike another similar game this game offers full crossplay support. lots of settings for controller players including setting dead zones! overwatch could learn some things from paladins. devs do a good job nerfing without killing the champ and if you are tired of a certain champ meta you can ban in ranked mode. keyboard and controller players are separated in ranked."
26843,it's good
26844,me like much
26845,it's simple fast paced fun
26846,no
26847,"With almost 2000 hours in this game and playing since early beta, I've got a pretty good idea of the game. I absolutely recommend this game to newcomers into the FPS genre however, people that don't have that great of a computer, expect the game to be poorly optimised for you and bugs to (maybe) run rampant. The in game community for this game can either be people on servers that don't speak any English with you having no way to communicate with them unless you thoroughly learn the VGS system (which takes a while, trust me) or the most vicious and whiny people. Casuals feel like competitive games and competitive games feel like you're either heavily getting rolled or rolling. Matchmaking has gotten better but isn't all the best it could be yet.

The few things I loved about Paladins was the loadout system and how unique each champion was to play. I have unlocked and played every single champion in this game so far and each is a pleasure to look forward to play. However if you're playing casuals and have an idea of who you want to play and if they're coincidentally a DPS character, you might want to insta-lock before the rest of the team auto-locks a DPS. However if you're looking to play a fair game you might want to pick up at least 4-5 champions in each class because it's a lot more common than you think, even with 45(?) characters in this game to choose the same champion as someone else.

The community is almost worse compared to Overwatch. It is actually quite unfair to compare this game to Overwatch. However at the start, Paladins was a completely refreshing and enjoyable game. Loadouts made this game unique and the fact you can customise your loadouts to fit your play style was amazing! That's what I loved about Paladins. 

But over time it seemed like Paladins was trying to compete with Overwatch. It's very sad because as much as I love Paladins, it was built on code that was combined from different games which meant that bugs are going to be hard to fix which frankly, over half of the community complains about at least 10 different bugs in their social media comment sections each day. And if they aren't complaining about bugs, they are complaining about how the Evil Mojo team should be focusing on bugs instead of skins despite there being separate groups for each. 

Which is unfair to Evil Mojo, ultimately. If they had the same resources and time most other games did, I couldn't fathom how amazing Paladins could've been. And that's IF they never stretched the teams so thin. So I'm only giving this game a slightly bad review based off of how poorly the developers seem to be treated, by both the community and its company.

*Edit, Paladins just announced Vora and I've just watched the trailer. I'm a bit sick and tired of the over sexualised characters in this game. I'm not saying sexy characters can't exist but It really gives me the vibe that all they care about is fanservice when it comes to female characters. I can provide a list of such. These characters include Io, Lian, Seris, Skye, Willo, and Ying but this list doesn't include any skins, just the default skins. It is also disgusting that they put boobs on a female character that is canonically 3 years old (Willo.)

As time passes by, I notice more issues with Paladins and I hope they try to better themselves as a brand because its getting pretty bad (IMO) at this point."
26848,Very fun game. Characters for all playstyles. AND FREE
26849,its a fun game thats easier to pick up than most of its genre

26863,"Great shooter.
So, 2000 hours further along i am still playing Paladins.
Although some bugs should be adressed, the developers imho are putting effort into the game, still.
There is something to do in the game for veteran, aswell as new players.
If you are looking for a f2p hero-shooter: try it out"

26896,"this game is soooooo good
"
26897,"pretty fun game, while you have a breaks"
26898,Characters are fun matches are short for the most part. In my experience it was either you stomp or someone stomps you. Too often are games highly unbalanced to one side or the other. The game itself does have some pretty awful balance issues. The big one people go on about is skye. Invisibility and this game really dont go together and it makes her awfully easy to play and get kills with even on players who are on top of their game. Other characters are also unbalanced and if they are in the game on either side the game becomes easy and boring or too hard and not fun. I like the game and its free so theres nothing stopping you from trying it and finding out if you like it or not. Just bear in mind the balance issues
26899,good

----------------------

Is Team Fortress too old for you? Is Overwatch too expensive or you just don't feel like using another launcher? Well congratulations you found a free knock off that does the same thing as every other routine FPS team game.

You can debate over which game borrowed ideas from which, and it shares some passing resemblance with Global Agenda, just reskinned with less  sci-fi elements and that wasn't a bad game either, 

There's nothing terribly wrong with the game, but in the end they all just kind of blend together. If this had a price tag i might thumb it down, but it's free and if you are into this sort of thing it's probably at least worth looking at to see if you want this option."

26928,"Non-transparent ban system / auto-bans for no reason

Played this game over 2.000 hours and was banned twice (1st time 24 hours, now 72 hours in august 2020) in this game. It was just my 3rd ban in my total playtime in 1,5 years.
Last year when I had the my 1st ban (24 hours) I tried to get some information from hi-rez support. But they couldn't tell me the reason in more than 4 requests.
So I decided then not to contact them any more for possible occuring further bans...

A totally non-transparent auto-ban system makes a real good game unplayable in competitive mode. People seem to report you for no reason: jealous gamer, troll player, non-serious player which where confronted with the truth while playing ranked mode... All of 'em can report you so that many pro-players use 2-3 different accounts just to be able to continue to play this game.
I am not willing or going to create different accounts just to play a game in which I reached that progress with my characters on my account just because developers don't check the legitimacy of the reports of a player before banning him.

THIS is the FIRST(!) game which banned me in my over 25 years(!) on PC-gaming experience.
And there was a lot(!) MP-games I played in these years.

It's a shame but I won't play this game any more (after 2.088 hours gaming time exactly) because of this non-transparent ban system or either recomment it to any other players.
Could have learned two foreign languages in that time I wasted in this game.

It's a shame...

Don't waste your time when you wanna play competitive!!

26935,"I love this game, for a free-to-play one at best. Tons of characters (champions) to play, just make sure you could master one of them to at least get some enjoyment out of it. I just don't quite like how there are no testing/practice ground for any of the champions so at least we can try out their potential to the fullest. Hopefully I could also re-trace back past players whom I have played with so that it would be convenient for me to add them to my party. All and all, for a free-to-play game, this is a very fast-paced and overall decent FPS multiplayer game."

26960,"I really enjoy this game, after playing it for around 700 hours I can happily say I'll be spending more time playing this game, there are a couple of mistakes that the game developers need to fix, but all in all I enjoy playing with friends and solo myself as well.
Yep I still like it."

26968,"Lag, lag and more lag.
Great free to play i have 100s of hours on my PS4 but after recent updates they are not quick to fix bugs and it runs badly.
Also you can't transfer your account over so after all the money and having all the characters I can't carry anything over."

26970,yes
26971,is good
26972,"I think the game can be quite fun. At times. But it has it's flaws. Like the inability to quit a game. I really hate that. And the fact that you are locked to what you have picked at the start of a round. Overall, I didn't enjoy this."
26973,E
26974,Big titty anime girls
26975,"Extremely fun game!
- It's Free
- Not a Pay2Win game, you only pay for cosmetics and QUICK unlock for heroes, ofc it's optional
- Chilled community
- A lot of heroes to play with
- Even a potato pc can run it with full settings, this is a big + in my opinion, even if we're in 2020 and all ''gamers'' have pc rockets
- Love the respawn sistem --> fast horses, love the card sistem --> puts you in different play styles with a champion
- Some bugs are still there (friend list) and some nerfs/buffs need to be done i belive
- Over all, to encourage him for the better, I'll give an honest grade of 8/10!"

26988,Great game to play with your friends. Only wish i could create a ranked team with all friends so we can do better.

27038,paladins has been my free-to-play game since i started 2017 since it was console i used to play alot flank and damage and after going over to pc ive been playing more healer so it always has it different roles and you requires you adjust and always level up while having fun
27039,its basically just overwatch but with anime girls
27040,"I've spent a lot of hours on this game.  Its fun for a free game.  No need to actually buy anything as you're able to unlock, I believe, all the characters eventually.

As of 2020 Aug:
Lots of bugs though, that causes the game to crash often.  In my house we have two Nintendo Switch consoles.  Paladin's crashes about every 5th - 7th game.  Pretty irritating too, in that if it crashes while you're in queue, you end up with a deserter penalty which prevents you from re queuing for a period of time.

If you crash during game the system AI takes over your character while you're restarting and purchases trash items that you're stuck with when you log back in.

Poor balancing when it comes to groups, or PC vs console.  When you're on console you can choose to only play against console players but if another PC player is group'd with a console player,  you'll still end up playing against that team.

The company seems to be non-responsive to bug reports.  They don't seem to care.  It is free, after all."
27041,A great first person shooter with enjoyable champions. Too bad there is so much bugs to fixe. It spoils the fun.
27042,like game
27043,no
27044,Fun free overwatch

27048,no
27049,It's fun
27050,is good
27051,"Okay, so as a player from all platforms: Pc/PS4/Xb/Switch I can say that I have  problem with this game. Thousands of hours put into this across all platforms. All of which I've gotten myself the champion pack. And spent a ton of time on. I can say this:

I love this game. Sure there's lots of bugs and silly things like random sound glitches, or vanishing enemies that don't have stealth mechanics. Don't let that detract from you playing this game though. Every game is different and every game has a host of new challenges and issues. Rather its that skye ripping apart your healer, or the seris/pip combo making your damage basically mute. Its fun though. Maybe not the best hero shooter out there. But anything is better than a blizzard product when it comes to competitive tidings.

If your just looking to pass your time with a 5v5 pvp (only) game that isn't LoL or some Overwatch then I suggest you look here. Its a lot of fun and once you get into the game it goes crazy real fast. 10/10 goty 2020."
27052,nerf raum
27053,pp fart
27054,yes is good
27055,Overal this is a good game but u should know there are alot of bugs in the game i've played alot on swtich and now on pc  but the game can be extremly buggy like when u win a match it could just go black screen or ur playing and go on ur horse u don't go on your horse u just run quicker and need to be shot to fight again
27056,Fun to play
27057,"Pros:
- Unreal Engine Graphics
- Build Customization
- Many Champions
- Many Cosmetics

Cons:
- Graphics are bugged whenever you try to change settings.
- Audio issues when using headphones.
- 90% of the champions are behind a pay and grind wall.
- Some champions are way better than others, some are practically useless or have better alternatives.
- 90% of cosmetics are behind gambling loot boxes (chests) with not have specific results.
- The gold you get after matches are very low and almost impossible to play for free.
- There is no pack that unlocks all champions like Smite.
- Many content are behind time limits and season passes which forces you to pay more money.

Overall a big downgrade from Smite and an absolute grindfest to play. If you don't have many friends who can play with you or you don't have lot of money just don't play it. Not recommended. Not player friendly."
27058,it says i need an update but nowhere it says theres an update avaidable and now i cant play it ;<
27059,Still fun to play <3 (Personally for me at least)
27060,"[h1] So what to say about Paladins? [/h1]

I've always heard, literally since I started playing in Open Beta, that people say it's just an Overwatch clone, which considering that

A. any shooter is a Overwatch clone by that logic?
B. they came out just a few months apart (OW before Paladins with Paladins being 1-2 months after)

I've always found it unfair to label it as a clone of something it's just losely based on (both are shooters and both have hero/champion characters to play as). Paladins has a lot of neat quirks and features that OW doesnt have and vice versa.

The main thing that sets Paladins apart though is how the gameplay flows:
[list]
    [*]You pick a Character for the whole game- no mid round swapping around
    [*]You make Cart Sets and pick Talents to make your character more unique in play style
    [*]You buy items like in a MOBA to get less cooldown, life rip etc.
[/list]

I've always called Paladins a ''weird MOBA shooter'' and it really is. The concept of making Card sets to really suit how you wanna play that champion makes the gameplay so different from Overwatch. The same with not being able to switch characters mid match. Team comps matter more and you gotta think more about what you think may help your team or yourself at winning the game.

All in all, it's a unique experience, one that i definitely recommend for anyone who's into shooter games and wants to try a new way of playing that familiar Genre."
27061,Love this game
27062,Nice!
27063,Please dont nerf Raum
27064,"Isa Great game. Love all the champions and there skills, very fun game 4.7/5"
27065,occasional crashes but a ton of fun
27066,"Very similar to Overwatch. I like the variety of champions and abilities. Balance, community, and matchmaking are par for the course, imo. Crystal prices are very high compared to it's peers, but cosmetic upgrades only. Maps, combat sound and smoothness, and graphics subjectively fall behind other games in the genre. Overall, a charming hero shooter that is different enough to be a viable, casual alternative."
27067,im putting yes because of how fun it used to be now its just an unbalanced mess
27068,i like the class setups. They allow for a different gameplay experience every match
27069,"Great multiplayer game.
And if you ask me, This game better then overwatch.

However it is very buggy at times, though it is something that is being worked on it can be a little irritating. The community is mixed like any other with really great people but also toxic sometimes. If you like this style of game, there is likely a champion who you would enjoy playing, since they have such a wide variety of them with all different types of mechanics."

27116,"It's a shit show of stomp-or-be-stomped games. Also, if you play at night expect to play against bots and not people bc there's not enough players."
27117,"This game is so fun! I can't stop coming back to it. Unfortunately the playerbase and Ranked in Australia is pretty dead but it doesnt stop me from playing on overseas servers and still enjoying my experience. The devs have done a really good job in recent times in restoring the game, adding new content and helping revive the diminishing fanbase.

I encourage new players  to give this game an honest try, it may take a while to warm up to the game but there will certainly be a champion that you will fall in love with. This game is much more fun with a group of friends or good players you find along the way. The game may be old but it is still one of the most fun game around today IMO."
27118,its amazing love the game so much that i broke my keyboard
27119,Great game to play with friends.
27120,"This game always gets that ""oh it's just an OW clone"", however for something that has its roots in that statement, it's come a very long way. The game still has it's bugs here and there but not nearly as much as at launch. There's a large character roster, and the item system combined with the loadout card system brings much more variety than any other class-based shooter I've played. Characters need to be unlocked (unless you're a pleb like me who payed $15 to unlock every champ ever), but they can be unlocked using the in game currency, and even $15 isn't a bad price for the amount of work put into this. The devs also are actively keeping up with the community as well with weekly updates. Def give it a shot, all it'll cost you is some storage space going in."

Now I think the developer for this game is bad because they cant even make the game better after 3 years. lmao Hirez
27143,this is the best game
27144,It's a fun and challenging game!
27145,"Net positive, would definitely recommend.

Engaging team shooter, all around really fun and easy to pick up, but very buggy."
27146,.
27147,"I used to play OW but i didn't wanna give any more support to Blizzard so I decided to give this a try... and I love it!
I'm mostly a support player, but I feel like every group of heroes in Paladins is super fun to play (and pretty diverse! I was shocked how many heroes there are AND how varied their skillset is!) 
Supports have more utility than straight-up healing and I like that a lot since it helps keep me engaged in the gameplay.

I will say it seems like it could be daunting for a new player, but if you have experience with MOBAs or other arena shooters you'll pick this one up quick. Just remember to BUY ITEMS and DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE OBJECTIVE!!! ...Also stop picking Flank if you already have 1. you can double up on any other role, but dont do it for flank."
27148,b ae
27149,It Good
27150,"Lovely game, so much fun with the cards and the talents, no need to purchase items and deal with that learning curve.
Only downsides is that Rank is awful, battlepass system sucks (as do them all), characters and skins are expensive and typically only available through cash purchases. I would love to see more easily achievable and varied rewards for playing the game via an achievement system."
27151,poopoo
27152,love the game have been playing it for a while now the best of fps and  i think is better then overwatch in ways i have both games and like paladins better tho online is fun at times but overall thumbs up
27153,I think this game is very fun and one of the better options when it comes to fully cross platform games. Overwatch may be better quality but it isnt ftp like Paladins. I have both games. The only negative thing I would say about paladins is that it often nerfs my favortite champions to the point they are un playable.
27154,i like this game
27155,"Fun game, wish more skins were easier to obtain"
27156,"Good game. Its not even close to Overwatch. I would say 9/10 cause it could be better, but hey, almost every game could be better."
27157,"I've owned the game since 2016 and I know I don't have a bunch of hours in the game (Due to another game with a similar take.. *cough*) but I can tell the game has gotten better since it's first few steps.

It's a pretty great game at no cost and I find it to be less toxic and less demanding of your very get good attitude. Though as of recent with the events taken place at Blizzard I'm starting to see chat be a bit more.. outspoken. Though most of the time you don't feel DEMANDED of you to be the best or carry the team.

Now going to actual game-play it's good & very fun. you have 3 basic game modes: 

Siege (Claim an area to move the payload to the enemy base) 

Team Deathmatch (first team to 40 kills wins. The first team to 400 tickets wins.)

Onslaught (I'll let HighRez explain this one: Two teams. One Control Point. Capture and hold the center point in King of the Hill-style gameplay with a Paladins twist. Slay your enemies to keep them off the point and earn 5 tickets for your team. Plus, get 1 ticket per second your team controls the point. The first team to 400 tickets wins.) 

Overall basic game modes but enough to keep the game fun and somewhat fresh every time!

I also enjoy the elements of customizing your abilities known as talents and creating card decks each with their own advantages and playstyle to how you want to play. I also feel like each character is very unique to their own without having to have a huge story to introduce them, they all fit very well into the established universe in which they all reside in.

Things I find disappointing:

The main thing I find problematic & wish that were better are the In-game currency you use to buy actual chests (loot-boxes) that are provided in the Season pass, you only get about 5 Crystals every so level ups compared to the only example I can think of which is Fortnite that gives you 100 V-Bucks every so often. Now the reason I state it's problematic is because Chests (Loot Boxes) are crazy expensive, they cost about 400-500 for the base chests and sometimes they go on sale for 100-200-300 Crystals sometimes. but you're making about 5 Crystals every so often at least a good increment in the amount of Crystals you get would be stellar maybe 50 or 100 would be amazing. but 5 is staggering, personally.

Also minor nitpick but some of the models in-game don't have any animation to their eyes.. yeah it's a small detail but I'm like that personally, and the models while playing the game feel lifeless due to that sometimes. BUT in the lobby when you're choosing your character or customizing your character, the model there has actual animation to the eyes/facial animations.. So I just find it odd it's not added to the real game-play portion and not just the lobby/customization menu.

Last thing I wish Hi-Rez Studios could do is finally add more maps and or at least variations to current maps to spice it up each round. Since I quit playing the game a while ago and just came back last year 2020, it's been the same maps since then + some added new ones which honestly I can't recall what is new. I noticed that the maps got smaller, back then maps were massive and it for sure was more of a pain to traverse those old bigger maps compared to these tight and somewhat better versions. Nonetheless no real complaints to the current maps, more of a wish to get new maps and or variations to current ones to shuffle through during each finished match also just to spice things up. 

Now back to the game and not my rant on the Season pass crystal amounts.

If you're thinking about playing this game or you find it interesting enough, or simply you don't have money for another certain shooter game that is about the same as this one, or you're escaping that very game for some very shady practices THEN I definitely encourage you to give this game a try. If you have friends to play with it's even more of a blast also.

Overall I love it, besides the complaints I've stated. I like the way Hi-Rez is continuing to update the game and not give up on it. The updates have made the game better overtime and I hope they continue to give the game more polish and not just release a character every 2.5 milliseconds.

Thanks for your time!"
27158,Very good
27159,"realy fun game, i personally enjoy earning the characters instead of buying them all but you will deffs see me getting that Battle Pass Every season. i love that i could edit a characters abilitys with the load outs and can basically change how they are played from one load out to the next. much better than the overwatch balance changes we have to constantly learn and adjust to. gives each battle some good ol spice"

27166,"not epic
"
27167,"Unbalanced crappy gameplay. I dont recommend this game at all. Do not crossplay with console players, heroes are ridiculous. Teamplay is important but only if u have certain set of heroes. Playing outside that set is pointless. Free to play game so ""smurfing"" is common, trolling, toxicity, random bans, etc ...
This whole game is waste of time."
27168,very good
27169,"this is considered the free version of overwatch from what i've heard. haven't played a lot of it, but from the little i've played, yeah, it's pretty good"
27170,If u dont have any money to buy overwatch play paladins
27171,I really enjoy how it is a fun skill based game. Everyone is about the same skill level so you all can have fun. lastly I really like how you get to choose what type of class you play and what you do with the class
27172,yes
27173,this game is stuid and very boring
27174,"Really well balanced, Fun to play, Immersive 
Paladins is really fun with a squad!! Besides Every Champion can become OP if you know what you are doing plus the roles are not set in stone like Overwatch and the in-game purchases are also really reasonable compared to other games"

27200,DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM!! I have bought A $30USD Pack and still over a month later and dealing with support they have NOT got it on my account or offered any compensation for this.. My first email to them dated July 21st and its almost a month. They CLOSED my original ticket without a resolution and made me submit another ticket (I did comply) and they STILL have not responded to this ticket and its been over 2 weeks. This is a FLAT OUT STEALING from customers. Have reported to Steam and IF i do not get the items i have paid for or value compensation i will report them to the FTC
27201,yes lol
27202,"Too many crashes, too many glitches."
27203,"unfortunately while the game run fine (most of the time) and has some interesting characters I can't recommend it for solo play.  If you go in with a group of friends that you can work with it can be fun, but on your own the systems in place to communicate with other player isn't good and the enjoyment of the game is too heavily based on other players,  A single AFK ruins a match or you have to balencea party comp when the others don't do their job.
Only get if you can regularly play with about 3 people, two randoms don't drag things often."
27204,Fun game! and its free to play and not hard to run!

27216,"You're at the Dollar Tree and you notice a soda you've never heard of before, [i]Dr. Thunder[/i]. It's half the cost of Dr. Pepper and comes in a 3 liter bottle. You could drink that all night and still have THUNDER left over for tomorrow. [i]Quality over Quantity,[/i] you think before passing on the bottle. It's what I did for 3 years on Paladins, before downloading and playing it in wine fueled evening.

Buy the Dr Thunder.

When compared to the on brand variant, there is evidence of cut corners. Characters are flatter than a defective traffic cone, and while there are more choices, it's like shopping at a Japanese specialty store for Kit Kats. They might have a green tea flavor, but it's still a Kit Kat. The objective based game types are not nearly as tense as the on brand, big brother, but death match is it's own special thing. Plenty of recompense in a good arena, with lots of trash talk, and bullets. 

This testament to brands are bullshit, and love doesn't make a thing [i]better,[/i] sad as that may be, is still a great time, if not cynical. This wouldn't be here without the other more popular thing, but for accessibility and market share, I sure am happy this is here. I suppose my frustration is in its quality, far from a demo of the full hero shooter experience, it's all here on display, with more (less tailored) ideas. 

And if you do end up wanting to throw some money at the game (I did, after 10 hours or so) you'll often find the champ pack on sale. 

The last point, is about generics, and about brand ethos. Is it worth supporting a company that sells an arguably worse product, when their R&D allow something like this to exist so cheaply? 

I don't know, but it doesn't bother me when I'm making people salty with Kinessa."
27217,"is is overwatch but free, Very nice"
27218,it was fun
27219,YES
27220,"This game is super fun and more on the chill side than other games in my opinion, but if you do decide to play ranked beware of toxic asf people"
27221,I dont want it.

27230,Its Good Game Funny but the proplem of it You Gona Boring From It Fast They Have To add More Mods And
27231,this game is just super fun
27232,"I have to say this game is amazing, i love PALADINS Because its very fast and tactical"
27233,High packed action game! Game is not boring as you can choose many roles and play the way you like to play
27234,ok lol
27235,"the servers are stored on floppy discs and the game is coded in morse, and it is an experience. i enjoy every update because i get to experience all the various skins and bugs the team comes up with each patch. my favourite champion is Evie, who is a human mosquito that teleports. you start with some champions with no cost to you but your soul, which include: 
-simp (replacing mech goblin)
-lesbian
-call of global offensive strike 2
-furry (replacing horse girl but bird)
-emo healbot
-fire mommy with a gun-sword but healer (replacing god of hair)
overall, i either really enjoy this game, or really hate myself."
27236,"This game is very refreshing and relaxing. Yeah, there are some toxic players, but let's be honest, are there any games without toxic players? After a long day of work and stressful situations, I'd fire up this game with my friend and have some fun without any worries whether we won or lose. But damn it's so easy to win when not playing ranked. Loved it a lot."
27237,"fun, addicting game. similar to overwatch style of play."
27238,Is your soul sad and empty due to Blizzard's never-ending poor development of Overwatch? Well this game that we all thought was a cheap knock off is actually really fun and CC doesn't feel as oppressive.
27239,"So going by 631 hours played. I absolutely love this game. Download this if you haven't. Overwatch is actual trash compared to Paladins, as Paladins, is free, and a better play, but Overwatch, is expensive, and not as fun. Download Paladins. You won't regret it!"
27240,It's ok
27241,cool
27242,"unbalanced heroes, koga is too powerful and can possibly solo the whole team cause this company loves overpowered bull. half of the matches it full of bots or people that dont know squat. and i do believe now that this is a ripoff of overwatch, and its worst then overwatch to next to fortnight and almost dead to complete shit, dont play this game, save time and sanity and money on a better game"
27243,is it buggy? Yes. Is it still very nice and free? Yes.
27244,im gay
27245,"Ok, this game is well made. BUT There is a bug, that is in the game for as long as I can remember. The game wont give you a point for winning a round. It happens when you need 1 point to win, and BAM the game doesn't wanna give it to you. Most of the time, this will result in you losing the game no matter the score."
27246,"This game is literally Overwatch but free, and free is a language i speak. It has non-frequent updates, some characters are unbalanced, and the mods don't listen to the community. Other than that the game is pretty good."
27247,Well developed good team game.
27248,been a long running player of this game and it is still just as fun as the first time. I usually play a lot with friends but even on your own the game is so much fun. also the BP's are hella creative and there are so many cute skins!!! love this game
27249,"champions are fun to play, cool.

uh not much to say its a good game"
27250,"Off brand overwatch. Not the name brand, but not that bad either"
27251,meh its fun
27252,"This is a great game if you're interested in gaming with friends. This game is cross-play which is awesome but, the game lags sometimes. This game can be played through your switch, PC, XBOX, and PS4 (:
There are a lot of cool skins and chests that you can unlock or purchase with crystals and/or with coins."
27253,i don't know what happend but when i changed from my old laptop to pc it got rid of the champions pass so now i have nothing
27254,good game needs players please play its fun
27255,"its ok
"
27256,Replay-ability is important
27257,The game is free so i recommend getting it just to try it out and it is a game that only certain people with enjoy. personally i enjoy playing it with friends but there are some other really cool aspects other than cross platform.
27258,Champions are fun. Yes
27259,This game gets boring in like a week wouldn’t recommend it.

27281,meh
27282,A free version of overwatch. I enjoyed it but there are some things that bother me. there are too many microtransactions in the game so its like a pay to win game
27283,"It used to be a really fun game, but the population is falling and matchmaking, which was never good, has become absolutely atrocious. I can't recommend it anymore.

But if you do decide to play, for the love of god, stay out of casual or quickplay or whatever. You're just going to get smurfs and premades over and over and over. Play ranked. You still get those people to some extent, but not as often."
27284,"Its a refreshing take on class based first person shooters, aka. hero shooter. I like the elements brought from Smite and after playing Overwatch the game is really easy to pick up. The control point mode where the point is moving over time is a great idea. The hero builds add flexibility and adaptivity to the game. I think the game could easily be merged with Smite just bringing over Moba style maps. Good fun!"
27285,THIS GAME IS BAD AND RNG IS A BITCH
27286,This game is amazing. I would totally recommend to play it. This game is ass. I fucking hate it. This game is basically Overwatch. I fucking love this game its so awesome. Id literally shit on this game if i could. I would play this game if it wasn't so ass. I love this game and everything about it. THIS GAME IS SO FUCKING TRASH. I LOVE THIS GAME WITH ALL MY HEART.
27287,"Honestly, it's a game that one should definitely try at some point. I am surprised at how varied the gameplay is, there are over 45+ champions and each champion can be customized using Talents and on top of that you can use Cards to create Loadouts for each Champion and each Champion has their own set of Talents and Cards. So basically this game never gets old, there are multiple ways of playing a champion, for example a support/healer cane be played as the main Damage dealer or a tank can be used to flank and so on all thanks to the Loadout and Talent system. 

It has to be one of the most fun game I have played and for those interested in Story, this game has a really deep Lore and has been expanding since the release. There's frequent updates and patches and new Champions every now and then, Community is really nice and constantly growing, and the Developers always take an extra step to encourage community made stuffs by having things like FanArt Friday, Showing off good Art on their Youtube Channel and having events like Community BattlePass and FanForge and so on.

To top it all off, this game can run on basically all types of PC and you can even play with players playing on Consoles if you wish to or just queue against other PC Players.

 Overall definitely a game I would recommend."
27288,good :
27289,Basically a worse free Overwatch with somehow even more fan service.
27290,nice game
27291,"Pros:
•Fast-paced
•Almost feel like for the fact that it is almost like Overwatch
•Great heroes with different abilities
•It’s easy to get Barik Team Fortress 2 skin
•Just think of it like Overwatch and you are good to go.

Cons:
•Gets repetitive
•Painfully pay to win sadly. By the time of this review, all the content is exactly $86.88 (VAT may be included in the cost)

In my opinion, it’s a mediocre game that preys on the consumer’s pocket. Doesn’t feel like it’s a fun game for me sadly 😞."

27301,"This game is pretty fun. Casual gamemodes don't have long queue wait times, ranked however is another story. Nevertheless, playing casual and ranking up champions and your account level gives more than enough enjoyment. Some champions do need some nerfs or buffs. I am not aware of the current update frequency, but I do hope HiRez keeps this game going so new people can enjoy this game as much as I do."

OTHER THAN THAT ithink this game is good, since it's free and all if they weren't killing good champions it would be good and probably popular."
27306,Decent. Chars a bit too squishy resulting in insta-death at times. Use your cards to prevent it.

"
27325,"Don't get this game, it's not even worth it free. The game is extremely buggy; each patch comes with game breaking changes but don't worry for the times the game doesn't patch there are tons of bugs that are simply ignored. If you're a competitive person you can forget about advancing at all in ranked. The player base guarantees you will not be able to play a ranked game without getting a hardcore troll. And by troll I mean like sit in the base and move around so the game doesn't let an AI take over for the player. 

All of the GMs duo with each other because the game can't balance against them, you will often have 2 GMs vs a platinum with a few golds on their team, fair right? You'll get stuck to walls, be able to shoot around corners because the hitboxes are completely screwed, and you'll lose ELO because the game just decides to crash every once in awhile.

DO NOT GET IT, IT'S NOT WORTH IT AND NO ONE CARES TO FIX IT."

27345,Amazing fun game. Cross platform amazing
27346,gud
27347,This is a game that is worth checking out.
27348,This game totally sucks. it used to be fun but now it is a bug riddled mess and the creators arent fixing it. Making it virtually unplayable at times.
27349,"First and foremost, let me start by saying that I have WAY more time in this game than Steam shows. I played it on PlayStation for about a year before PC

Pros:
- Hero-based Gameplay
- Very team-driven
- Made with UE3 so it can run on a potato
- Some fun skins
- Relatively well-optimized

Cons:
- Maeve
- Skye
- Viktor
- Most champions that deserve more skins have very few
- Hi-Rez seems more interested in pumping out skins than they do in balancing the game.

If you like competitive team-based shooters, go play something else.
If you wanna enjoy yourself and just have fun, go play something else."
27350,"Its not bad what can I say, but like you wait for ranked 5 mins average time, and when it finds your ranked you get players that cant even play shit, very unbalanced champions from my point, like flank can kill tank in like 3 sec and flank vs dmg is like 10secs, lot of supports are from my point unbalanced as one heals alot and have dmg and others heal low and do 0 dmg and are paper af. so I dont recommend playing this unless you wanna have fun in nonranked games."
27351,hi and this game is nice to play but just to warne you if you hsve kids dont let them play it it shows boobs
27352,Casual friendly game that can be a challange at higher levels of play. Totally recommend. So much more dynamic than the boring overwatch even tho overwatch seems more dynamic at first glance. Playing it from season 1. Mostly Diamond 1-3.
27353,actually pog
27354,cool :)
27355,Never gets old
27356,"my only problem apart from the fact that none of my friends play it. is the fact that for some reason characters load awfully slow on my computer, which they shouldnt considering i have an nvidia RTX 2070 and 16 gb of ram. not only that but if i look at character skins en masse the game likes to crash whilst doing so."
27357,Its not overwatch
27358,fun
27359,"Although it has some little glitches the game is really good, i wish the developers would put a little more effort into it but its still an amazing game. Specially if you dont like the average shooting game"
27360,good yes
27361,very good
27362,its filter for our region
27363,this is  a very epic game. it is a good introduction to first person shooters and STEAM
27364,Fun if overwatch is to expencive
27365,"Great Fun, can play as serious or as casual as you like with friends or on your own."

27369,"Initially a game me and my friends flocked to as a free Overwatch alternative, this game quickly showed it's colors and showed how much more unique it really is. Paladins has been joked about before due to some similarities to Overwatch, but with much more frequent updates, as well as being free from the get go, Paladins is already ahead in some regard. Paladins also has many more characters to play as, allowing for a larger variety in how you play the game. Unfortunately, this game suffers from the same thing many other major games suffer from: how easy it can be to feel angry at either your enemies or your team. This was the main reason our group stopped playing, as we always felt like we were angrier after finishing a couple games. If you can deal with this issue, or are already acquainted with this feeling due to LoL or Overwatch, then this game is for you."

27375,A fun and free version of overwatch
27376,"I have more fun with Paladins than Overwatch, with actual customization to the characters via decks and not having to swap champions every 5 seconds, despite it's lack of polish.

That said this game is absolutely riddled with bugs that have been around for several patches and the team clearly just doesn't have the know-how to fix. Most of them are non-game-breaking but just annoying.

And THAT said it looks like Mojo is trying to hire senior and lead programmers, so hopefully they'll find good people to fill those roles that are actually capable of fixing the bugs.

If they fix the bugs then the only remaining issue will be imperfect netcode, but at least everyone suffers equally and consistently from that. Get prepared to die after thinking you've escaped behind a wall by .7 seconds."
27377,play it you goober
27378,"Good game

27379,Pretty good game and funny to play with friends ♡

27390,fun
27391,its a cool game
27392,"i think the mechanics are great, i love the card and loadout system, ive played a good amount but usually stop every few years. 
theres so much freedom to each champion and usually no two loadouts are the same. some things could be fixed but i think its a great game if games like overwatch are too high pressure for you or if your computer cant run it, this runs on just about anything which has rly saved me for times like now where my pc is broken and parts are being delayed. characters are almost always interesting and have cool concepts. some hitboxes are wonky but its easy to get used to."
27393,I dislike some of the balancing of some of the characters
27394,"i used to love this game, im a ying main and im carrying my team. 

i am currently in the hospital because every time i finish a game my back is in pain
i wonder what it is tbh"
27395,It's just F2P overwatch. Except it's not owned by a company who supports ChiNazis.
27396,Play if you dont like overwatch
27397,I regret playing this and once in a while i still play it. 2/10

27415,This game is very good you should try it and its free as well so a better bonus if you have no money and it lets you play other characters and its fun try it if you want to.

27421,great
27422,Its good
27423,"Played this on console and enjoyed it for a while and loved it when third person became an option. I finally get a PC and now I learn third person is gone and more than likely will never return. Yeah that was the only thing that was keeping me on it when I was playing it on console.

Do not add a feature to the game only to remove it later. If you didn't plan on keeping it then it shouldn't have been added in the first place."
27424,best game ever
27425,yeeet
27426,"I love this game, I'm not great at it but it sure is fun :)"
27427,"This game is wildly fun! Meta feels much more nuanced than Overwatch. Each champion feels very individual, with engaging and ingenuitive abilities. Would highly recommend!"
27428,"If you like a 30% winning ratio because of bad team match ups then this is the game for you, if you just play for fun without the need to win then this game is very fun, don't get me wrong its a solid game, but its just so annoying when you've gone through 20 games and 7 of them were good games (by good i mean either a tight win or destroyed the other team) most game matches don't seem fair enough, and i think the way Ranked works is stupid... noobs can play ranked and wonder why the teams doing so bad XD."
27429,very nice yes

27446,"Very fun, and entertaining. It is a good time killer while having fun and the characters are balanced so you will always have fun especially with your friends."
27447,Its alright
27448,Paladins > Fortnite
27449,"TLDR: There is a good game somewhere beneath the bugs, glitches and toxic playerbase.

Here are A Bunch of Thoughts:

Losing 7 matches in a row and then winning 7 matches in a row only to lose 7 matches in a row again, provides the perfect blend of frustration and boredom. Steamrolling and getting steamrolled.

Keypresses not registering makes for fun challenge mid firefight.

It always feels rewarding if you snipe an enemy around a corner because his hitbox is the size of a small continent. It's fair because all the hitboxes are wack.

The game just randomly sending you back to the main menu and giving you a deserter penalty. It's only the second match of the day but I guess need a break already. I can write a review in the meantime.

Having not a single champion above lvl 9 and getting matched with an average lvl of 30, I am learning so much getting destroyed by more experienced players. I bet my team appreciates my efforts for self improvement.

F***ing Raum (wups where did that come from?)

That one match per day where both sides are evenly matched, everyone has a great time and we all exchange 'ggs' afterward, makes everything else kinda worth it... maybe... probably not..."
27450,Its pretty good
27451,A FPS with a lot of depth.
27452,play only with friend
27453,nice

27456,very intense game and can run with really low specs
27457,good game for gamers if your a girl play some paladins if your a guy play paladins if your transgender play brawhalla
27458,I've played this game for years although I didn't really rack up much time because it gets boring quickly every session I play. The game used to be trash then it became better than Overwatch and now it's a buggy mess. No one even really talks about either anymore because they both aren't very good anymore and I would suggest this game because of it's pros but there are so many cons that I just can't! You're better off playing Team Fortress 2 again.
27459,itsz so good waosidowa guys az plaez pleayz it z so goodz it so goooooooodz pleas pley it gud gem no li no skem

27477,its okay
27478,"100% recommend it, its really fun to play casually, cant say much about it competitively tho but its great! (not perfect obviously but still a lot of fun)"
27479,It's like World of Warcraft and Overwatch had a baby. then gave it up for adoption.
27480,its good
27481,For the Realm!
27482,yes
27483,fun :)
27484,"I would give this game not recommended because it is an Overwatch clone, but...
Paladins has less hackers than CSGO so that outweights all the negatives."

27486,good
27487,gg ez
27488,"Well, a really nice game. I love it, since I got no money to buy Overwatch, this one is a really good substitution of it.
The graphics.. You can say it as good. The gameplay? Really breath-taking since you're playing 5v5 and pushing the objective or holding a point. Nice choices of hero, play-style, and skins. You can have great skins and/or avatars if you play it often enough (due to battle pass). 

My rating: 10/10"
27489,free overwatch
27490,good
27491,shit game makes my pp soft
27492,"Started playing this game in November of 2017 and it was pretty fun regardless the insane amount of bugs in the games. It definitely has its ups, which include the wall behind ranked which attempts to stop smurfs in ranked games. I feel like in its early days, like in Beta, it did recieve special care from the developers but it just feels like they want to milk this game dry with several expensive skins for the same characters *cough* LIAN *cough*. It definitely has strayed away from ""Overwatch"" if you want to compare it to that. So overall, I would give this game a D..for delightful, but a 6.7/10. Made some memories with it ngl."
27493,"A poor man's Overwatch. 10/10.

Also, less smiting than I expected."
27494,this game is amazing not a very toxic community can just play for fun and get better alongside friends i hope this game blows up more soon.
27495,"Paladins is a fun and intense 5v5 game. Although a lot of people might tell you that it is an overwatch clone, I can assure that it is not. Some characters and game mechanics may have been inspired by overwatch but the game as a whole is in no way a clone. The game does have some downsides with matchmaking, character balancing etc but despite these issues the game is really fun to play with friends and it is free to play. I recommend this game to anyone who is interested in fast paced 5v5 action"
27496,fun
27497,this game is awsome
27498,Its  a great game with nice graphics and the gameplay was pretty fun i recommend it
27499,.
27500,it is a very modable game but no so modable like very modable . overall modable game 6/10 .can be made more modable
27501,The queue in this game is incredibly unbalanced and frustrating. Repeatedly join matches where you're steamrolled. If you think that's fun you're dumb af.
27502,yay
27503,Zexie loves this game
27504,"Compared to other fps games i've played so far, i found this one the most entertaining and satisfying to play. For almost 8 years i had only been playing your typical modern warfare, however i also was a fan of mmorpg, and the magical aspect of this game was what brought me to play this game for quite a while i'd say. Nowadays when i log on to classic shooters like CS or CoD, i don't really feel fulfilled, and when i want some more action i just log onto Paladins."
27505,"Like it recommend it
"
27506,RELEY GOOD
27507,"I have been playing this game with my friends for sometime, recently I decided to download it again. At the first launch, everything was fine. Than at the second launch of the game, it crashed and made my computer restart automatically. Ive redownload the game and it doesnt change. Now I cant play the game bcs of this bug. Ive search for solutions on google and its basicly says that my computer wasnt good enough to play the game, what kind of BS is that, I can run R6 Ultra Graphics for 150 FPS and cant play this game."
27508,"I've played way too many great games to waste my time on this trash...and money, I'm ashamed to admit.  It appears to be bot driven and the controls are confusing.  You are utterly disappointing."
27509,"fun, but a blatant overwatch ripoff."
27510,"One of the most fun games i have ever played tbh
"
27511,"The game is pretty good, but the devs have made very questionable decisions throughout it's history, managing to ruin it further every update. It's still good enough to eat scraps though. Definitely not as good as 2-3 years ago though."
27512,"i try to run a game but my game crashes everytime
"
27513,The amount of hours I have in game says it all.
27514,community more toxic than league
27515,pretty fun
27516,Pretty fun game but it might get a little boring if u dont unlock all the champs. If you need a recommendation for who to unlock first if you're going to go solely by coins I'd say go with Androxous
27517,"Funn, but has a lot of bugs!"
27518,.
27519,"Bugs are being fixed, nice to see."

27532,good game fuck maeve players
27533,fun :)
27534,"I still play Smite occasionally and this game was made by the same company, so I figured it would be worth checking out. I really wanted to like this game and for some time, I enjoyed playing it despite my initial reservations. It's one of those titles you have to play to actually experience the fun of, gameplay videos don't really do it justice.

But the further I got, the more obvious it was to me that Paladins lacked proper direction. It's artstyle is an unappealing mess, and while the level you can customize your playstyle with cards is simply unmatched this also leads to a number of problems with balancing everything out. Things would be much easier with the usual approach to asymmetrical balance, but the depth this system offers is precisely the biggest appeal of this game and why I would consider checking it out.

What made me actually quit Paladins was the terrible, awful, salt-on-a-wound matchmaking system it has. As with almost every multiplayer game, the people who are skillful but not quite at the top (such as diamond- and masters- level players) make for the most toxic part of the community; and their toxicity is further amplified by said matchmaking system that creates tremendous amounts of frustration. I don't plan on ever going pro and don't spend 6 hours a day honing my FPS skills, so for a casual looking to spend his free time on lowering stress levels dealing with them isn't a good experience."
27535,Fun but so many Bugs and Crash a lot
27536,Not work's on LInux? Realy? :)
27537,"GOOD
Game

27538,Its cool on its genre and i love defense games :D
27539,"VERY GOOD GAME, I LOVE PLAYING PALADINS AND I ALSO LOVE MY FELLOW CONSOLE PLAYERS WHO ARE ENJOYING THIS GAME! RANKED IS VERY FUN, PEOPLE FLEX AND COMMUNICATE ON EU SERVER WHICH IS VERY COOL! VERY POSITIVE AND INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY!!! GAME RUNS VERY SMOOTHLY AND THERE ARE NO ISSUES IN THE GAME CURRENTLY. HOPEFULLY AFTER MY 7 DAY BAN I CAN COME BACK TO THIS GAME STRONGER THAN BEFORE!!!"
27540,"I have been playing this game for years now (lost my old acc which had over 500+ hours) it has been my go to game whenever im bored and cant decide what to play. i think it is fun but not that addictive because i feel that the game does not have a lot of impact or juice, by that i mean the skills and shooting does not feel good like other shooting games most of the characters attack feel like shooting a peashooter."
27541,FPS With role..quite mainstream but still good
27542,"Bugs, lags, cheaters. Hi-Rez Studios don't give a f*ck about the game and players."
27543,🌸
27544,fun game
27545,"game is fun
but HOLY FUCK it's filled with bugs
game is basically a quick cash grab, a SHIT ton of cool skins, but the gameplay itself needs a lot of updates, which just don't come.
If they would just put a little bit of thought into the game, it would be SO much more enjoyable!"
27546,every time crashes :(
27547,Nah. Save your SOUL and never touch this game. I'm serious.
27548,"An amazingly well written homage to the Resident Evil 2, and it shows."
27549,IF YOU WANT TO PLAY TDM GAMES OR PAYLOADS THEN THIS IS YOUR JAM
27550,"ANDROXUS TOO SCARY,  DO NOT PLAY!!"
27551,"While Overwatch kept getting worse and worse after each update, I feel like Paladins has just keep improving. I first played it years ago, and even though I liked it, it still felt a bit ""Budget OW"", it had some good executions and ideas, but lacked that little bit of extra polish and feel OW nailed. However, while that 'extra' was never implemented, Paladins just keep on delivering. There are a few minor bugs here and there, and the matchmaking may be a little be ""weird"" at times, but overall it keeps that original idea intact and just improves on it. Among all things, I think I enjoy the character design the most, at the same time they are very varied, but they still feel like they could belong in a world all together, and they all have different ways to be played. There's nothing really bad to say, if you like Hero Shooter, you'll very likely like this one too."
27552,AWESOME
27553,fun but easy
27554,The game itself is really good. The only bad thing about it is the match queuing time (1-5 minutes).
27555,"I want to like this game, and it's certainly good enough that it wouldn't be fair for me to not recommend it (I played for a couple hundred hours on the Switch before putting in the 43 hours I've got logged on the PC), but as my SSD continues to fill up, Paladins didn't make the cut, and here's why...

With many multiplayer games that I've put a lot of time into, like DCUO, my review is something along the lines of ""Flawed game, stayed for the great community."" Paladins is the opposite. I love the characters, I love the gameplay, and I love the level design. It's the social interaction that detracts from it.

As with all games of this type, in which the characters are quite different from each other, and even the talents you then choose and the perks you purchase throughout the match continue to significantly affect the role you fill and the result of the match, there is always going to be a divide between the casual players who just want to play a fun, relaxed game, and the more serious players, who feel it is their duty in life to nag at you about everything you're doing wrong, boot you from the group if you choose the wrong character, etc. Regardless of which end of that spectrum you fall under, this aspect of it can make it difficult to enjoy what otherwise has the potential to be a great game.

Now, if you've got a few buddies you intend to group up with on a regular basis, that's a lot of fun. But if you intend to rely on random groups (I'm a night shift worker who has no life and therefore no friends :p ), be prepared for the toxic environment that is becoming all too common in this type of game."
27556,super fun.. i play it every night with my friends
27557,I am done with this waste of time and space
27558,GOOD....
27559,"This is quite the fun game. Initially, I was hesitant because I thought this game would be dying and was simply an Overwatch clone, but the diversity of characters and how there are multiple play styles per character with the unique deck/talent system drew me in and has kept me engaged. Would definitely recommend Paladins, especially to those who are unwilling to pay the required sum for Overwatch."
27560,cuz yes
27561,got pussy bc of it. thx Paladins
27562,Economical Overwatch
27563,"Used to be fun, but toxicity and Hi-Rez greed killed this game for me, so I switched to playing games against AI, but now even the potatoes that some might call new players have no idea what the objective is. On top of that, the AI is cranked way up to compensate for more experienced players. This mega AI only seems to trash noobs that I somehow get match made with, and being focused by all 5 enemies while my team are exploring the spawn room and hiding from the enemy definitely doesn't scream ""Proper New Player Experience""

In short: Bad tutorial/NPE combined with overtuned bot AI leads to massive CBT, don't play this game unless you wish to suffer the toxicity that is a Hi-Rez game.

Unfortunate too, the characters and world of this game's universe has a lot of potential [strike] and most of the female characters have soul crushing thighs [/strike]"
27564,epic
27565,"this game fun for some reason, imma keep playing it until i get bored lol"
27566,"This game is a free Overwatch but differs in many ways, kind off takes a while to get champions unless you buy the pack. Bugged, filled with toxic players, devs only focus on ways to increase income ie. cosmetics. No balancing at all. If you aren't able to buy Overwatch save up and buy it otherwise play paladins till you can."
27567,Laggy trash
27568,"........................................................................................................
"
27569,"A very good game that is similar enough to Overwatch to have similar play styles and gameplay but different enough to distinguish itself. My only complaint is that it can take an extremely long time to be able to play ranked, as it requires a certain amount of champions as well as a level 15 player."

I was once a tiny little shit playing on my mom's macbook with no mouse and dream to G a M e. I thought this game was the shit, however I realized this game was shit. I want the hours that I spent playing this game day after day when my mom got home back. I need them back. Please             please. but im downloading this game who knows how many years later to see how bad it turned out. wish me luck.


15 hours later: still shit. me and my homes found goats"
27588,Unbalanced game with toxic community and devs that don't care about their games. If you want proof look at Global Agenda and Tribes Ascend (made by the same company).
27589,dredge is love dredge is life
27590,"I came into this game expecting an Overwatch Clone. Although there are many similarities and some blatant copies of characters, Paladins is it's own game. The customization of character builds makes for a unique experience. Definitely worth a try for a free game."

27598,GOOD GAME
27599,"Extremely fun game!
- It's Free
- Not a Pay2Win game, you only pay for cosmetics and QUICK unlock for heroes, ofc it's optional
- Chilled community
- A lot of heroes to play with
- Even a potato pc can run it with full settings, this is a big + in my opinion, even if we're in 2020 and all ''gamers'' have pc rockets
- Love the respawn sistem --> fast horses, love the card sistem --> puts you in different play styles with a champion
- Some bugs are still there (friend list) and some nerfs/buffs need to be done i belive
- Over all, to encourage him for the better, I'll give an honest grade of 8/10!"

27616,"No offense, but the game has gone to shit.

I 'm a long time player, and I used to love Paladins. But the way the game is managed tilts me.
We're in state where Paladins has more bugs than features. The client works half of the time, there are frame rates issues even on the most beefy computers and the balance of the game has gone to shit. And the policy of bug fixes just consists of : If we can't fix it, we remove it. Kill cams, gone. POTG, gone (not really a big deal when 90% of the time it's mroe like ""GJ VIKTOR YOU PRESSED YOUR ULT"").
 I lost the feel of having specific champions for specific purposes. The fact that now healers can be everything in the game makes no sense. I feel like the balance of the game only relies on money making bullshit, which makes no sense. You don't believe, me ? Ok. In season 3, the 3 most overpowered champions to make you climb are Io, Androxus and Maeve. Source (in French :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7ok3iqR6c0).
I wouldn't recommend the game at it's current state. The game loses players everyday for a reason.

27623,it's paladins AKA bad overwatch
27624,"I like the game and I think Paladins should be supported even when I disagree with some design choices. 

This game is free to play and it has big technical issues like glitches, balancing, control problems.

I am mostly a support (healer ) main and I do Frontline (Tank) on the side. 

The game offer varieties in game style with many Characters to learn. 

Urgent Note: PLEASE FIX THE CONTROLLER IN THE SETTINGS.

I tend to use "" keyboard and mouse"" for messaging and selecting but "" controller "" for game play. It switches automatically to "" mouse and keyboard"" mid-game but I want to use "" controller"" and I try to switch it controller from the seeing but it tells me "" You cannot do this action during the game "" . 
Please fix this issue.  Thank you. 

It is still fun !  Try it for yourself, if you do not like it just ""uninstall"""

I wouldn't say the game is bad/shit but its seen better days. Paladins had a huge scope for turning out to be more than just an Overwatch clone but as it is now and Hi-Rez concentrating more on Rouge Company as of this moment I don't really think there is going to be a high point for Paladins anytime soon. But I'd still urge people to give it a try, I've made all my friends play it. If you've got the time its not a bad game to get into."

27694,.
27695,What Overwatch Quick Play should be like.
27696,"It's Overwatch, but free to play, deeper (more choices of playstyle per hero) and a fair bit buggier. A couple of the heros can feel a bit unfair to play against and matches can be decided on the character select screen (composition is very important), but if you put some time into learning a role and have a few friends to party up with then you can have a lot of fun.

The Seige game mode is fantastic - capture the point turns into payload escort, demanding your team to adapt to what you have to do and how your opponents are attacking/defending. Close games going either way seem to be fairly common, and are where the game feels at its best. You'll occasionally be stomped (or stomp) but the matchmaking is fairly good at balancing (it takes recent matches into account, so win streaks are pretty tough)."
27697,Thumbs up!

Other days, however, you get some cantaloupe who holds down m1 while auto-cocking himself to the sound of his wife having coitus with her boyfriend who bought him a Nintendo Switch. All this little lampshade does is hold m1, upload a clip to reddit, and masturbate to Overwatch on nhen. When enough people like his post, he tumbles his way over to his his kankle’d up wife and says,""Heuheuheuhe g'day m'lady! On my last post on r/paladins I got reddit gold! Tonight we dine on chicken nuggies while watching CallmeCarson and r/dankmems like the EPIC GAMERS we are."" Like bro, go touch some bicurious 14 y/o child at a smash tournament so you can satiate your need to dominate some aspect of your pathetic life. Better yet, get hit by Truck-kun and get issekaid into a world where idiots like you can live out your pedophelic fantasy with a harem of underage school children. You aren't a gamer, you're a redditor. Screw Hi-Rez and their egregious balancing. Buffing everything is not balancing. Overall the game pretty fun and I would recommend."

27739,"Quite a good game to get to substitute Overwatch with a wide array of characters that can benefit from a large plethora of play styles and tactics. However being free means that all the characters have to be brought by in game currency that is quite slow to get and the easiest way to get all the characters is to pay £20 for the character pack, but at that point you can just buy Overwatch. This game has some cool features that i like, such as the individual levels for characters so that you can unlock skins and mastery emotes according to the level you are on that character and if you have a gold veraint of a character it is a sign of true dedication to the game and your main. Another thing that is hidden being micro-transactions is most of the skins that are hidden in loot boxes and some are payed for by crystals that are extremely slow to get now that they removed daily login rewards that they used to have in this game. And now the fastest way to get crystals is throught the battle pass that is also very slow to grid through. So to sum everything up, this is quite a good game but most cosmetics are unachiveable to the normal player and it is hard to find a character you like in the limmited selection you get when you join the game, but as a game to just waist some time on and have fun with your friend on regardless how poo their pc is and how broke they are, as this is a free well optimised game.

27760,d
27761,"Really fun FPS. Don't know why it isn't that popular, but yeah! Really fun!"
27762,"Paladins is a free to play hero shooter with a roster of 30-or-so characters divided into four groups; flank, damage, support and frontline. The charaters range from shooty soldiers to dagger-throwing catgirls and giant cannon-wielding tortoises. The game is played over three different modes; team deathmatch, capture point and siege - a payload escorting game mode. In each mode five players form a team against five other players. In ranked mode you can also ban out problematic champions.Paladins puts its own spin on the hero-shooter genre by allowing you to customize your characters playstyle by allocating five ""cards"" to your loadout that can alter how you can utilize your skills. You might have a shorter cooldown on some key skills, more health, faster movement etc. In a match you will also earn credits to spend on further modifiers that can reduce reload speed, increase movements speed or healing etc. It's a good system and is fun to mess around with. The game has a few monetization forms, which don't feel too invasive or predatory (unless you count in lootboxes). You can buy a champion pass that opens up every champion available and all future champions too. You can buy the battlepass to get cosmetics, you can buy skins and other cosmetic crap with either direct purchases or in lootboxes. Grinding for in-game currency to open up new champs is pretty fair, but the wait for premium currency can be quite long, unless you really grind out the battlepass system. Even then it's a long wait for a single particular skin or even a box. The game has pure crossplay too, making play possible between ps4, switch and pc. This is very big, as the player base is not that expansive.Paladins is also buggy, messy piece of crap code that will drive you utterly insane.The game crashes frequently, the party system can just bug out, there is barely any matchmaking in the game, the playerbase is toxic and this frequently results in games with bots replacing ragequitters (this problem is probably caused by the non-existent matchmaking causing unwinnable stomps). Hit/hurtboxes are wildly inaccurate with headshots happening even on blatant misses and deaths behind cover happening every now and then. These negatives can make the game an extremely painful experience, even if there is fun to be had.Oh and the lagging servers are apparently out of control. Howabout shots going through walls, players glitching through floors, shots and abilities never firing out, teleporting players, the list just goes on and on and on. At least on EU, the game can become pretty much unplayable at times and Evil Mojo barely does anything to alleviate the situation. Maybe it's because of crossplay like Street Fighter 5, maybe the game is utter spaghetti code and the servers are the cheapest they can find. Who knows. Try the game out for free, but don't spend money on it unless you REALLY love it. The game is a total mess and isn't really improving over time."
27763,not balanced
27764,y
27765,so many toxic player....
27766,Better than Overwatch. Overwatch lets you play each character 1 way. this game allows you to customize  cards that boost your heros abilities and allow you to play each character multiple ways. For most heros many ways are viable too not just set as one way being infinitely better.

27768,"쉽고 재밌습니다

27769,fun game
27770,"i'm gonna be honest. no disrespect to hi-rez studios, but this game is just a dumbed down free to play overwatch

the game is way too easy and that's not a good thing as the hitboxes feel like they are as wide as most of the walls in a single map, most teammates you get in this game don't have enough brain to contemplate what's going on in front of them as 88% of them are children. but this game isn't all bad i do like some of the champion idea's and hi-rez know's what they are doing whenever it comes design female characters. but overall the gameplay aspect of it is just bland. most matches feel like absolutely nothing is happening and the game run's off of easy anti cheat so cheaters are common. so the most ""fun"" you get in the game is getting killed by cheaters and broken classes

upsides to this game include:

[amelia watson voice pack]

[tons of greatly designed female champions ;)]

[runs well on low spec pc's or laptops]

[great cinematic trailers]

my conclusion is just buy overwatch, and if you can't just stick with this"

27787,"I recommend this game because it is free, fun,full of action and it will probably give you more hours of enjoyment then many payed games will. It's a Hero kind of 5vs5 battlearena with 4 gamemodes (TDM, Hardpoint, Siege and Ranked Siege). All heroes have mutliple skills but only the ultimate skills are really OP. Somehow they never feel as frustrating as in other Hero games, it always feels somewhat fair or logic when you die. The weapons itself do enough damage that good aim really is rewarded and gunfights don't feel like an endless grindfest decided only by skills. At the same time the time to kill is long enough that you can't dominate the whole lobby only with great aim. It will be very difficult to win 2v1 or 3v1 fights so teamplay and sticking together makes all the difference. There is a long list of heroes to choose from, but it seems like a lot of them have comparable outcome of skills. That results in just a different cosmetic display of the same skill.  What i really enjoy is that you can build/tweak each hero with the cards to fit your own personal playstyle. The que time for finding a game are maybe a little bit longer then most games (+-3min), especially if a player leaves the lobby when the match is about to start, but at the same time this is probably the first game i played where every game all the positions of the teams are filled and nobody ever left during the game either. So i'm glad to wait a bit longer for better quality games.

Cons of the game:
- Earning Gold bug. Sometimes you don't get any of the gold you earn after each match, untill you restart the game. I find it a bit worrying that for a game that's been out this long these kind of bugs haven't been fixed yet. Especially since this gold is pretty much the only way to unlock new heroes.
- Ranked: Ranked is only available in the gamemode i liked the least. You will need to put 10 hours into the game to unlock ranked.  And once you get there, the community seems fairly toxic in the experiences i had. It reminded me of CS. Prepare for 14 year olds telling you what legend or class you should pick almost every single game, and leaving the lobby when you dare to pick a different one  even if it's in the same class (because you didn't unlock the other legend yet because you don't get the gold). This often rises the que times to 10+minutes. One was also of the oppinion you shouldn't play ranked if you haven't played for over a year because a lvl 7 character is useless to their team. Apparently they seem to think, that this game is rocketscience and you need to graduate from their university before you are allowed to have the honor to play with them. Also a lot of namecalling, wishing eachother deseases and all that good stuff during games. People dieing and shouting they needed heals while the healer was allready dead, because the one who died ran off 20km away from the objective into enemy base, only shooting in front of them and not paying attention what's happening behind or to the sides. Overal it's mostly a game about sticking together to win. But because of the bad experiences i think i'll stick to normal gameplay instead of tanked, also because i found TDM and Hardpoint modes way more fun and less predictable for me. And the people are way more chill."

27793,WHOOOOOOOO f a king HOOOOOOOOO
27794,"Where do I start with this game right now. It's not doing well that's for sure.

Every time I go to play this game I play a single match and then quit 9/10 times after because there is no reason to keep playing. Matchmaking is downright awful and the game is filled with toxic players, including me. The new champions that are being added feel bland and not very exciting and the game runs and has always run very poorly. 

I am the last person in my friend group that still plays this game due to sunk-cost fallacy. The person who introduced me to this game and has clocked in almost 4000 hours quit gaming all together and I am 100% convinced it's due to this game.

I visisted Hirez Expo a couple times before, I kept up with the professional scene but this was all around 2018, 2019. Nowadays nothing interesting happens surrounding this game anymore and I can no longer play the game casually since I got randomly placed in GM when the highest I ever peaked was low master. I guess that is proof of how few people actually play this game in high elo.

The Battle Pass, all of the new ones, suck. They are not worth it. Extremely grindy to complete and very little reward compared to the old 80+ tier ones. Everyone I know prefers OB64 to the games current state

Matchmaking sucks, the game runs poorly, the community is awful, balancing is done by monkeys and people with verified checkmarks can do whatever they want without exceptions.

I will continue to play this game in the desperate hope to relieve some of the joy and excitement it once gave me but I would suggest you stay as far away from it as possible."

27837,"I've been quite fan of this game for 6 years since Open Beta, i very much adore my hour i spend in this game learning how to play, every random matchmaking, and with friends through every years despite sometimes i stop playing because busy with other games and then come back occasionally playing again, now this game feels different the more it goes, it has quite few glitches, random lag spikes, settings games bug like despite you change your graphic setting nothing happen,  and for the love of god the HIGH LATENCY, im already in my own goddamn region server, for some reason i get constant high latency in every matchmaking these lately, everything else is fine, but this high ping latency and few others issue that is still keep going is just ruining the game more, i will play more often if they fixed everything in this game, especially the high latency and the lag spikes, i hope Hi-Rez will stumble my review lol"
27838,"It is a really good and fun game, and i will really like if i can get some free skins lmao."

27842,game is better then overwatch
27843,its alright
27844,great game nothing more to say
27845,"The game has awesome mechanics and had fun gameplay it just needs  some polishing, but that is not my problem with the game, in my opinion Paladins has the stupidest player base i had the displeasure of encountering, no matter if you play ranked or normal games people do not care about team composition and just pick a random champion  which in the most cases they do not even know how to play, they do not care about strategy or team play and it is quite frustrating to be part of a match like that even if you explain to them why a certain item has to be bough or a certain champion is bad for the team composition they do not care and insult you 90% of the times,the game in itself is quite fun but the playerbase is one of the most toxic and ignorant and stubborn  i have ever encountered in my life, most players only pick the champions that are in the meta of the high ranks or some youtuber uses which does not apply to the rank they are in nor is that build necessarily a good one, all in all good game but stupid people that can make your match very unenjoyable."
27846,"s a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. Described as a ""hero shooter"", Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from a roster of over 30 characters, known as ""heroes"", each with a unique style of play that is divided into three general roles that fit their purpose. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time. Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character skins and victory poses, as they play the game. The game was initially launched with only casual play, but a competitive ranked mode, various 'arcade' game modes, and a player-customizable server browser were added after release. Additionally, Blizzard has added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, all free of charge, with the only additional cost to players being optional loot boxes to earn cosmetic items. It was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows in May 2016, and Nintendo Switch in October 2019.

Overwatch is Blizzard's fourth major franchise and came about following the 2014 cancellation of the ambitious massively multiplayer online role-playing game Titan. A portion of the Titan team came up with the concept of Overwatch, based on the success of team-based first-person shooters like Team Fortress 2 and the popularity of multiplayer online battle arena games, creating a hero-based shooter that emphasized teamwork. Some elements of Overwatch borrow assets and concepts from the canceled Titan project. After establishing the narrative of an optimistic near-future Earth setting after a global crisis, the developers aimed to create a diverse cast of heroes that spanned genders and ethnicities as part of this setting. Significant time is spent adjusting the balance of the characters, making sure that new players would still be able to have fun while skilled players would present each other with a challenge."

27852,"it`s awesome game i liked the skills of character and aiming is very good ,i see that some champions have bad look and theire is bad skins and good skins,there is some bugs happend please fix that bugs ,when i open the game maybe it will become window mode and i choose full screen so i must do window and choose full screen again,it`s like aiming game but by using skills like LOL and Valorant,it`s look like overwatch"
27853,"I've been playing for a while, and recently there have been more and more bugs that make this game a drag and unplayable. I just tried loading into the game, but it said ""version mismatch- reconnect"" before I logged in. I clicked it, and logged in fine. Jumped into a match only to play for two minutes before everything froze and I was magically back at the log in page. I get placed back into the game again, (Same one. they put you back into the same game if you get disconnected, replacing you with a bot in the meantime) and then immediately get disconnected again to a black screen. I Alt-f4 the game and check my internet to see if I'm the problem, if I truly am on the wrong version, and my connection is good, my ping was 32-64 in game, and I was on the most up to date version. I load the game again, and try to get into a lobby with a friend. after five minutes of trying to lobby up, I get put into the same game again, only to have it last about 30 seconds before we lose. I know this game was free, but the bar was set pretty low and I am still disappointed in this games performance. I can even overlook the fact that you have to either unlock or buy all the characters, I just want it to be playable which is a roll of the dice, at best, whenever I log on."

27872,crossplay is very nice
27873,"This game has just continued to decline as time goes on. The list of old bugs that have never been patched out after YEARS is insane. Bounty Store skins are just hilariously overpriced. New champions are almost always outright overpowered and some older champions are entirely irrelevant or just worse versions of newer champions. 

This game is just not what it could have been, probably due to Hi-Rez's lack of funding for the Paladins dev team. No disrespect to the devs, as I'm sure they're been trying and trying with what they have. At a certain point, something's gotta give... and it's looking more and more unlikely that we'll have a great, lasting shooter on our hands.

Played the hell out of it over the years, but I cannot have much fun in the game as it currently stands."
27874,playv it

27876,great team game with a high skill gap
27877,It's like Overwatch except fun. Best part is clowning on the kids that come in claiming to be Top 500 in OW then the scoreboard says otherwise at the end. New main game.

27891,"Me and my friend agreed to play this game 3 days ago. In a bad stroke of luck, my router broke for 2 days so he played without me. Now when my wifi returned, he said that he won't play with me anymore along with a lot of silly excuses. This is sad. I'm sad. I felt betrayed. As a newbie, I love this game. But it hurts me knowing that I don't have any friends to play with. Maybe I'm meant to be alone."
27892,epic
27893,Buggy game
27894,fun
27895,Good game if you like a class-based shooter. Good abilities and pretty balanced heroes. Only complaint I have is that some of the heroes are too expensive and take too long to unlock for free.
27896,120302 bruh
27897,"Less competitive than overwatch at the moment, great playable bot content. less angry attitudes.

Playability -I find it smooth and varied depending on the character. The diversity of characters and acquisition of characters is a big deal in Paladins in a different way since you must buy them. This can be done through free play, which is a great feature, or you can earn some cool skins and emotes etc if you pay. Great option, Would looooove to see some more PVE content of some variety, but this game hasn't focuse on that at all. Still, I have a lot of hours here :D"
27898,great game

27917,"revert movement speed changes after OB65, was way more enjoyable back then, may the money i spent on VIP points forever be doomed in the abyss where that system was cast into"

27930,"If your'e a newbie looking to play this freetoplay game called Paladins. DONT.

I've personally played this game for over 2000+ hours and the only reason i still play is because of my friends who still play this game. Skill Based Game. Should have Great Positioning etc whatnot.

Its fun to play sometimes, when not against a 5 stack mother♥♥♥♥ing tryhards who boast their 69% stacked winrate & 4.20 KDA.
The matchmaking is a JOKE. (15K playerbase tops)
Toxic Community.
Idiots, Retards & Trolls. You'll get to see a ♥♥♥♥ing Zoo here. ♥♥♥♥ING ANIMALS WITH NO GAMESENSE.
Furry Skins. Copied Skins from Overwatch, LOL AND WHAT NOT.

Use Skin Boost or i troll. These are people with autism who got ignored by their parents.

Instalock DPS Last Pick. Sadly, these guys can only play DPS and suck at them because they just suck at their real life and they wanna tell us that they suck in the game too.

GG EZ Gang. Oh these guys, they stack, they pick two tanks or two healers and after the game ends, they say GG EZ in the chat but when they loose they cant talk BECAUSE THEY HAVE MY DICK IN THEIR MOUTH.

Oh yea, Last but not Least, Hackers & triggerbotters are pretty common in this game.

Before you judge my Rank, I was Masters in Beta, Season One & Three. Didn't play in Season Two."
27931,meh
27932,great game
27933,"Its amazing and sadly overlooked!
"
27934,"make sure to validate your files everyday as they seem to somehow get lost
other than that would recommend highly."
27935,"+Enjoyably simple and easy to play.
+Colorful cast of heroes, some of whom appear to be direct references or homages to famous characters you might want to play as.
+Short but involved matches make it easy to pick up, play for a bit, and put back down.
-Music is terrible and obnoxiously loud.
-Voice acting is terrible and obnoxiously loud.
-Game is buggy as hell and loves to have graphical, network, and compatibility freakouts at random.

As a once dedicated Overwatch player, I find this game a pleasantly digestible substitute in the hero shooter genre. Given a larger budget and more resources I feel it could really be amazing and a stand-out gem in the market, but as it stands it's mostly an arcade-y, ""one more match"" type of game best played from a relaxed distance. The game's wild and chaotic nature would make in-depth investment and analysis probably unrewarding for most.

6.5/10, more fun than Overwatch these days, and with a lot fewer hackers than TF2."
27936,"pretty cool to play with your friends
"
27937,"Used to be good, but Hirez has officially killed it. This game is a piece of dog **** now, please do not ever even try it."
27938,game sometimes maybe good sometimes maybe s‎h‎i‎t
27939,Really fun but an absolute mess
27940,"Paladins to some (Or many) may at first come off as an Overwatch rip-off, and therefore not worth playing, but getting into it, while similarities are still noticeable, it has its own personality, such as unique abilities found nowhere in Overwatch, as well as a variety of cool and/or comedic cosmetics. Combined with fun and frantic gameplay, many different champions with more to come, and you have yourself one of the best free games one can play. The TF2 Engineer skin for Barik doesn't hurt either."

27987,I don't even play shooters. I love this game. It feels so good and I absolutely murder everyone. It's insane.
27988,"They have hanzo that can go invisible and edgycree that is the love child of a cowboy and reaper but instead of high noon, he goes full moon.
And yes the basic gameplay and some characters are basically the video game equivalent of sense of right alliance but it does have its unique stuff. 

Now I dont do much research into companies and if they have different departments for each game but since I used to be a smite player (another hi-rez title) and since I just see them add characters upon characters like tony the tiger, I can slowly see the smite meme of ""hirez and balance"" being implemented in paladins, although I did find some already soooo.....

I do think for the next nerf they should remove barik turret, and his shotgun and just make him melee only character to avoid the similarities with another character that is a dwarf who smacks his turret.

This isnt even a review, I Am just bored during purple haze requiem (coronavirus for them non weebs) awaking that sitting home here is just becoming repetitive."
27989,it free. it cool. some characters kinda unbalanced tho.
27990,not the best pick
27991,"as much as I hate to say it, this game isn't great"
27992,seru nih game
27993,"This is a really good game.
I started playing this game since it's beginning, and I've enjoy every single hour that I spend in this game. If you find strategy, and action games interesting, this is your game. You will have to choose a counter to your opponents, and if you don't you better pray that they're bots. I've played in alt accounts, and it wasn't as fun as with an advanced account. You find quite a lot of bots, it takes some time to start buying your first characters, and you only have a few to try. There is not too many people playing this games and is dying really quickly. This is still a good game, but if you are new player you might find it a little complicated, slow and boring. But don't let that stop you from playing this game, with the time you might find it funnier, also, you should play it with friends, it makes the progress a little less slow."

It's not a pay-to-win game since every player has equall privilliges during battle. You do need to grind a lot at the beginning for gold and champs, I'd recommend you to buy the champions pack."

The only downside is that there is not a huge variety of maps. I think the current maps are good, but get stale after playing them after awhile."
28021,it isn't good enough as much as OW but anyway it's free
28022,"As a person who transferred over from the console version, I might not be the one to give out a review to any new arrivals, but as someone who on console tried out paladins as an alternative to Overwatch, I must say give it a go. Paladins is much more unstable and much more unpolished, but it is also much more enjoyable long term. The ability to play a character multiple ways kept me going for over two years on console, and I'm now rediscovering it with the pc controls offering a new challenge. A good team based game, just experiment without paying and work for the new characters if you like it."

28039,"""I want Overwatch... Hm, don't have $30. I guess Paladins is the next thing huh?"""
28040,"This is by far the most fun hero shooter I’ve invested my time into, where in most other games I end up growing a distaste for playing against certain characters and load outs, Paladins is a game that presents you with a slew of characters that guarantees that at least one fits you like a glove. The item and card systems present in the game do a lot to promote unique and creative playstyles, or just copying top player builds to turn your brain off and have fun. My complaints with this game are that outside of Siege and Ranked, I don’t think there’s a single game mode I enjoy, and that the game’s physics engine, for lack of better words, feels unpolished where something about character weight and the gravity of the game don’t work well to create refined consistent and fluid movement and often feels like “Overwatch under water”. With changes to the physics engine, this would absolutely be the greatest shooter I’ve ever played, but because of the movement I end up feeling an odd dissatisfaction with my actions in game. Though the physics could just be a me problem, I’d recommend giving it a shot, with some friends preferably."
28041,"I gave a positive review cause im still playing this game, but this down reason is still killing me.
Game is f*cking unplayable one big reason? TANKS nerf that tanks do you ever see gameplay of some tanks in game? to much broken. 4 guy hitting one tank cant deal damage cause why? tanks can heal himself, tank can deal damage, tanks can shield himself? hello where is the point of the game when tanks have 90% win rate...
for other things in game i can say that my suggestion is to put lower price on champions,and give some guide for items to new players cause 70% of new players are not buying items.
for other things i can say game is fun to play looks nice have great sound and 
movements but tanks are to op..."
28042,"its cool, i wonder why overwatch copied this, oh yeah its so good 
haha get this game!1111"
28043,
28044,It's free and it's fun.
28045,its aight
28046,REALLY FUN
28047,good game
28048,"(At least Bobby Kotick doesn't make any money off of this)

It is an unpolished buggy nightmare that will suck you in and drown you in toxicity and abhorrent matchmaking. They cut the dev team and the game systems get a complete overhaul every few years so it is very hard to maintain momentum as a long term player.

But at least it isn't overwatch"
28049,"good game ,optional micro transactions but not necessary to enjoy the game"
28050,Noice
28051,"Super fun and gets a bad rap as 'discount Overwatch', but it really is its own game!

PROS:
Awesome roster of heroes
The talent and 'deck' system makes for some really diverse playstyles
Fun cosmetics and voice lines
Easy to grind coins to unlock more champions, however the default roster is definitely playable and viable from the first time you play

CONS:
As with all F2P games, there is a heavily monitised item shop for cosmetics, however you can no longer buy levels on champions to unlock their talents faster, which is good.
They removed some of the best voice commands/VGS systems and the play of the game, so sometimes your awesome plays go unseen
Gameplay can sometimes feel a bit slow, or even empty on the bigger maps even if there is a full 5v5 game.


Overall a solid 4/5 game for me, especially because its free and holds its own against OW and other arena shooters"
28052,i enjoy the game but there are really trash things such as not be able to log in as it says version mismatch so you have to close the game and re open it and other one is where you can be playing good fps before then your fps will be so garbage like 1 fps if that gets fixed i will say it a very good game other still great
28053,"Pladadins is basically budget Overwatch, but it's still a pretty decent game"
28054,ehhhh the game is game of game when u game with fellow gamers
28055,"Fun game, amazing quality for the price"
28056,"yes, but yes"

28059,This is a good game it is my favorite game and it is very good and the gameplay is very good and good
28060,yep
28061,"Game is Fking buggy af~!!!! Freezes, Stops Working, Version MisMatch, Game has too many bugs for PC ! Great Game but Needs to be Fixed and Tried of this Issues and Makes the game unplayable. Thanks"
28062,This game is not worth your precious time.
28063,fun game
28064,"A game with high potential which seemed promising at the start however now is seemingly abandoned by it's developers. Each update brings one bad decision after the other and also introduces more and more game breaking bugs. 
Server issues have a been a problem for multiple months now with seemingly no end to them. 
Perhaps Hi-Rez or Evil Mojo knows that the game can't live on much longer which explains the financial pain you have to go through in order to buy something you want. You can't. You can only either A) Buy lootboxes (hooray...) with a CHANCE to get what you want or B) Wait for your desired item to potentially appear in the ""Deal of the day"" which costs 8€ and includes 3 completely random items which can either be a skin, emote, spray, avatar, ... however it is stated nowhere clearly if the item you want is even in the item pool that can appear in this deal.
Game balance is something Hi-Rez hasn't learned much about in the past few years. There have been so many big changes and harsh reworks that it feels like a completely new game today, both in a good but mostly in a bad way. Community feedback looks to be ignored on this topic.

Would I recommend it? If you have no money to buy Overwatch or aren't interested in other team-based online FPS games, then yes. Otherwise, no. The server problems, horrible matchmaking and excruciating game balance make this game an absolute nightmare and complete waste of time to play."
28065,shitty teammates but overall a nice game
28066,Biblical
28067,ITS FUN BUT NEW CHARACTERS NEED TO BE ADDED MORE
28068,it's ok
28069,xzz
28070,very epic and worth the money
28071,Overwatch Crossplay Free Ediiton. Fun time!!!
28072,"So where to start on Paladins.  I do feel like this game is a hidden gem.

A long time ago this game lived in the shadow of Overwatch and its kind of impossible to talk about Paladins without bringing that up.  Overwatch had much shorter of a shelf-life that I thought.  In the beginning, there was a mass fandom on near starwars level of zealotry.  Now everyone plays either Fortnite or Valorant.  Overwatch has languished and no new heroes are really being released.

In the interim, Paladins grew into its own and is now what I would consider a superior game.  First off, Paladins is constantly updates, frequently, with new battle passes.  New champions are churned out on a monthly basis, which each one being unique and for the most part decently balanced.  No champ is universally useless, while some are hated.  Rebalances and meta-shake ups happen frequently.

Where Paladins really succeeds is in its role as a competitive experience.  Overwatch ultimately failed as a competitive game because the meta was left to tarnish.  Champions have set skills and are not changable.  The action was too frentic and esports commentators could not really follow the action through the jump spams and bullet clouds.

Paladins is simple yet clean, its easy to find out whats going on.  The game has incredibly clear indicators to give situational awareness as to what is happening around you whether it may be a Viktor grenade or a Skye Bomb ult.  When watching competitve Paladins tournaments hosted by Hi-Rez, the action and commentary is very easy to follow.

In Overwatch, champions have set skills with ZERO customizations.  Overwatch tactics are based off picking a champ to counter your enemy even though you hate playing that role or champ.  Overwatch forced you to be ""good"" with everyone and you didn't see people be able to focus on one champ to become a master because someone would just counter pick you and own you because their kit cancelled yours.  I HATED that about Overwatch and I think that contributed to why it failed as a competitive game.

In Paladins each champion has 3 unique legendary skill and a ""deck of cards"" that can be created to support specific playstyles.  Paladins has over 45+ champions that grow every quarter and each champion can be custom tailored through legendary skills and decks to achieve completely different playstyles.  I have seen crazy crap that works, like a smoke bomb skye (who is normally a flanker assassin) carry the team as a primary healer with a skill that causes her smoke bomb to heal allies and with skillpoints that enhanced the effectiveness of said bomb.  You cannot do crap like that in Overwatch.

After the time I put into Paladins, I would say is a good game.  Sure the graphics are cartoony and not on Overwatch level, but they are enough to convey the action and have their own fantasy charm.  The champions are interesting with hundreds of playstyles that fit any player from any other FPS game.  If there is certain gun in another game, its probably in Paladins in some strange way.

You can conduct all sorts of crazy skilled plays.  There is always a handful of champs that will ""click"" for you.  My only complains are that yes matchmaking can be better, but no game has perfect matchmaking and getting stomped by a legendary player during the rare moments you encounter one happens in every FPS known to man.

Paladins is also free to play, the battlepasses and cosmetics are relatively cheap compared to say Valorant's 100$ dragon guns.  Skins range in all flavors from goofy to serious.  There are plenty of waifus like Grohk if your into that sort of thing.

I think anyone who likes competitive shooters should give this a try -for at least a week before passing judgement.  It's one of those games that may not feel so amazing at first but when it starts to click and you see the depth it becomes really addicting and grows on you.  It also has a stable and fairly large community, a competitive scene, and stays within high activity."
28073,"i used to be very into Overwatch when it first released, but over the course of it's updates it's become less attractive to me. This game has felt the same since day 1 to me and each new champ feels fresh and rewarding."
28074,"if you dont want buy overwatch!
you can play paladins broooo!"
28075,It's a fun free to play team based shooter
28076,Game wouldn't load up. Would start loading up and the bar would reach the end and then the game would just close
28077,Cool game. Nice mechanics. Gameplay and graphics are also perfect.
28078,Noice
28079,"dont play the diabetic turtle, hes really bad"
28080,"Small PvP community which is extremely toxic, but doesn't take away from how great this game is for hopping in whenever you want to team up with friends or kill some time."
28081,game is kinda spotchy here and there but it will keep you occupied and will give you the attention you need.
28082,It's better than Overwatch now.
28083,"its an ok game its kinda hard to get gold but reccomended 
"
28084,"This game is very fun when you have a team that wants to work together towards the objective. My biggest gripe about this game has nothing to do with game play and everything how some of the previous battle passes have been set up. They don't feel as rewarding as other games with battle passes, if I buy the pass it should have enough gems, to buy a few skins if you don't like what the pass has to offer"
28085,Good fun
28086,game was good 4 years ago came back still having fun
28087,"I play this game not because it's a ""poor man's overwatch"", This game has character, a lot of unique mechanics, and while the graphics are serviceable, and the bugs notorious, the game still functions when the servers aren't on fire (which is too often unfortunately), and the ability to customise your champions with cards makes it great to fiddle around with. Some cards completely change the mechanics of champions and it's brilliant."
28088,"Fun game, plenty oif game modes to choose from. Sometimes strange glitches, but for a free to play certainly a recommended."
28089,Nice
28090,"this game has crap ton of work to do on the user experience. and getting the community together before i will recommend this game to anyone. every other game i play has a thrower on my team. i wonder if the enemy has something similar. but when i watch players go afk for more than half the match and completely ignore whatever objective is set out for that mode. i wonder why they even logged in in for the day. until their ban system is HEAVILY improved to remove toxic behavior and allowing players to get reported after matches. im all set. on top of that. i cant add people. and almost no one has mics or chats in lobby or team chat. and when i as a new player ask questions i get people replying with things like ""stfu retard"". and ""fuck off noob"". its the most toxic ive seen in a multiplayer game to date. even worse than overwatch. and i come from playing halo on xbox since 2009... that should explain how much of your time you will spend watching your team lose to these rude and degenerate players. its not fun. the game design mechanics etc are great. and the hitboxes are lenient for players with bad internet and laptops etc. but if this is the community behavior. and the devs do nothing to insentivize good behavior and team gameplay. or discourage bad teamplay and rude behavior to this extent. move allong and try another game. you wont be so discouraged from playing so quickly."
28091,Pretty dope
28092,It is a fun fps ( first person shooter) and it is free so why shouldn't you buy it.
28093,invalid account hatası veriyor 3 gündür tüm çözümleri denedim 4 kere kaldırıp yükledim düzelmiyor
28094,"I recommend that you stay away from this horrid game, I've wasted too much time with it (I could have been playing other games that are ACTUALLY good). It is unpolished mess of a game where creators just don't give a flying f*** and instead of fixing bugs they just release another skins for a ridiculous prices. Dunno who to blame tbh, the company as a whole? incompetent programmers and their spaghetti code? (literally one of their reasonings of ""not introducing new game modes"" was ""beacuse it would give birth to new bugs"" ...just PERFECT. Matchmaking is out of whack (matching golds against gms), balancing decisions a lot of the times are questionable. What more to add? Oh the toxic and entitled community (actually typical stuff so..eh), ugly graphics, bad performance, lags (prolly cus their servers are on fire most of the time)...oh and every new patch just adds even more bugs on top of existing ones. It is sad a spectacle, it could have been amazing, they are literally sitting on a gold mine....too bad that they just don't care (oh wait nv they care...but only about our money).
STAY AWAY FROM IT, please just don't waste your time like me
.....
....
ok i'm gonna play another match real quick"
28095,This game is a very well made and fun game to play. Like every good game however there's annoying players that'll just make random sounds or be generally  annoying. The best thing about this is that you can mute them so it's all good. I like all the characters and the maps are well made too. I highly recommend this game to others.
28096,5555
28097,Very good 3D FPS game
28098,Colorful and easy to play while still having a high skill cap making it fun to put the time in to practice.
28099,it is good game but there is no play of the game

28101,I feel like it is a game that take a lot of getting used to and would be fun if you wanted to spend lots of time on it. However I think that the champions in this game are unbalanced and instead of balancing them hirez just makes all of the champions have overpowered abilities and attacks. I think its too hard to get into.
28102,im not a fan of this game because its basically a free overwatch and is very very repetitive dont buy it youll play one match and youll see all the game has.

28112,"Basically just a free to play Overwatch. 
The gameplay is fun.
Champions are easy to play with if you know the role mechanics. Each champion has unique gameplay which could be challenging at first, but will get a hang of it when you put effort on the champion.
Wished it has a high player count. Otherwise it's a good game."
28113,As a free game this game is like pussy to me
28114, nais play paladins
28115,Its the best!
28116,"Literally deleted and re made this review. 

The player base to this game is terrible, half the players in this game are toxic rude people and the other half are pretty chill nice people I've made a few friends from this game but the toxicity really ruins it honestly. 

The character design ability wise is very cool I mainly play damage based characters in overwatch or valorant LoL everything really but in paladins the tanks and supports are interesting and fun enough for me to play them every character is at least mildly interesting or fun 10/10 character design

The maps aren't great they are kinda buggy and boring but they work enough to let character design shine. 

The polish, there literally is none this game is buggy laggy glitchy it feels like a FTP game from 2010 and it basically is, some of your games will play out just fine and some will be unplayable over lag and bugs there are game breaking bugs that have been in this game since RELEASE, there is a whole google doc made by community content creators that has HUNDREDS of bugs that have been in for years its depressing how unpolished this game really is. 

The anti cheat is a fucking joke at one point a cheater ruined a tournament openly cheating and didn't get banned for 6 months after the fact and its just account bans so he's probably still hacking along with everyone else with aimbots and esps. 

The toxicity is unbelievable I was playing with my girlfriend one day and our teamates were constantly sexist and weird towards her for an entire competitive match and they spammed her with friend requests for about a week after that match and she couldn't even block them to stop it but those guys are still not banned after I recorded them being sexist and saying vile things and sent it to hi rez MYSELF they are still unbanned. I have an uncountable unimaginable about of stories of toxic players just going unbanned I cant get into it, just know hi rez does not care nobody will be banned and nobody at hi rez cares.

The devs release new characters new buffs and nerfs even new maps and events constantly its incredible but they're doing  that trying to keep the game alive so they can squeeze money out of the players constantly with skins and shit they don't care to fix the bugs or cheaters or even ban openly racist or sexist players the developers really just seem like they don't give a shit about this game.

TLDR, terrible toxic community, good character design, decent map design, Its a fun game but its buggy toxic and the devs don't seem to care I would skip this game or if you play it just expect a questionable experience.

(I have been playing this game off and on since around feb 2017 and none of this has changed at all since I started playing)"

28126,"I love paladins, it's super competitive and fun. Few things would be awesome if they focused more on fixing current champs and putting out new maps. Some of these test maps have been around for over a year. Make current champs more enjoyable to play , like bug fixes and then focus on getting more maps out. Higher ranked matches are hard to play with high mmr because everyone knows the maps so it's hard to try out new champs and mostly ends up in an unfair match for one side all cause they tried a new champ out. -this is in casuals. There's several other things that could make this game more enjoyable but overall it is still a really fun game to play."

28212,"I doubt mature audiences would enjoy this. And by mature I don't mean age. I only played it a few seconds to know it's not for me - to tell you the truth, I didn't know what I was expecting. It was a free game so I joined it."
28213,It's free. It's an okay FPS game. The heroes are good. The skins are okay. The server are a bit wonky at times but that's manageable.
28214,"It's fun, try it. It's free."
28215,Paladins is an excellent team-based fantasy shooter with varying Champions that offer unique abilities to experiment with in-game. There are multiple game modes and loadout options to choose from what can make every Champion fun to play without the idea of a single one being too or overly powerful. Paladins supports casual and competitive gameplay.
28216,is fun but is at a horrible state currently wait for a little while unless you want to be pulled in by greed
28217,"This game is awful, I highly recommend it."
28218,"Been a part of the game for a damn long time, mostly played on PS4. Now downloading again to see how it's going on. Edit: Matchmaking sucks, servers suck, you have to delete a file to play the game. How are these still operating devs?

Do u know this kind of games u hate and love at the same time (no League of Legends, i dont talk about u this time). Paladins is one of them for me. I love the Characters, i love the skins and the gameplay. But i hate the Competitve mode and the kind of players u get. While it has some pretty decent characters and skins (what i like much more as in Overwatch for example) u have on the other site players who got the typical ""i pro, i pick what i want"" mentality in competitive mode. So Paladins is the only Competitive Game so far i know where u cant choose fix roles before u queue and thats the biggest negative point i can bring. So far...the only negative point i can bring.

Play the game, have fun with it. Its free to play, but look that u find enough people for a group. Its way more fun to play with friends as with randoms. [b]Big Bonus for the game. U can buy a Champion Package where u get all the champions PLUS all future champions!!![/b]

28243,"Fun arena shooter, its got king of the hill, tdm, and conquest. Team death match is as it sounds. Conquest you sit on a obj and gain points to spawn a cart to bring to the other teams base, king of the hill you sit on the obj and try to hold it for as long as possible, all of these are against another team trying to do the same as your team. its a fun shooter with different characters, different roles, and play styles."

28245,one of the best games in the world

28247,"yall, I havent played this game in ages, but to see the new character name is yikes. Only kills the young and elders pog."
28248,Very good game. 10/10 would do again
28249,"This is the sort of game you play while watching youtube, or facetiming a friend., or when your bored of playing games that require your full attention, and that's all meant to be in the best possible way. This game is brainless fun. It has little to no strategy involved, and absolutely no waiting around. I lost my steam account for about two years, and despite all my other highly detailed and expensive video games, I was quick to get this game on my console. (It does get boring and repetitive playing hours at a time, but no other complaints) 7/10"
28250,"free overwatch, but better"
28251,"Paladins is a high-octane and fast paced team shooter. Many say it is an Overwatch clone -- it is not. There is plenty unique to this game and distinguishable between the two.

The art direction is beautiful, and the champion roster is vast and diverse in both gameplay and aesthetics. The maps are easy to learn, and easy to use. The game has a low skill floor, high skill ceiling. The champions and maps are approachable for newcomers with or without team shooter experience, and new characters are being regularly added. 

The loadouts present a bit of a learning curve, but guides for these can easily be found online. Each hero also comes with a set of preset loadouts for you to roll out of the gate with.

100% would recommend.  This game is a lot of fun."
28252,Overwatch but free and more buggy BUT more creativity
28253,"
it good"
28254,"whatever genre this is, it's purely the best. 

no league. no Wow. no Dota."
28255,"Paladins is a hero shooter, much in the likes of Overwatch, but with more pronounced MOBA elements. The cast of numerous characters is colorful and they all have their own personality, even though some of them come off as rushed or not very well thought out. The graphics are serviceable, which means they are not the best but not the worst either; they are colorful and get the job done.

What makes Paladins special is its unique Card system, which allows you to customize each and every hero with your personal play style. It’s rare that you’ll see two players using a certain hero the same way, and this makes the game less stale overtime than other similar offerings. Because of this, each and every game ends up playing differently, and this is exactly what I love about the game.

The in game economy is based on cosmetic only loot boxes, which means that despite being free to play and not counting individual skill, no player will ever be stronger than another.

The game receives updates, events and new heroes extremely frequently. Even though some bugs and glitches tend to stay longer than necessary at times, they rarely become game breaking or end up taking away from the enjoyment of the game.

Paladins is a free to play title that simply doesn’t feel like one, and this balance is very difficult to achieve nowadays. A well crafted card system, colorful heroes and good shooting mechanics make this game a joy to play, allowing it to stand out among the crowd of otherwise stale titles offered by much more renowned names in the industry."

28287,"I really don't understand why the rating for this game is so high. 

The game is such a level of ""casual"" that it's barely competitive at all. AFKs every match, dead/empty chat in games, no skill gradient - It's awful. 

Plus I noticed you just flat-out removed POTG since I played last. Why? That seems like a move you only make if you're hiding the degree of exploits in your game, or just working around how bad the sever performance is. 

Further, the UI is a pretty far departure from other competitive shooters. It's not cool or charming, it's just clunky and irritating. Feels like a UI for a mobile shooter, tbh - the ridiculous prevalence of cash-grab extras and lack of new content support that claim too."

28324,Worst matchmaking and playerbase of all FPS i have ever played. The game had potential if the devs didn´t abandoned it.
28325,is bullshit
28326,Great game.
28327,BUYER BEWARE! Great game but terrible customer service I have been trying for a few weeks now to get a hold of someone to fix a issue with a purchase I made specifically with the Champion Pack. I made the purchase back in 2018 and haven't played for a few months and Hi-Rez made me make a new account and lost the Champion Pack in doing so because I couldn't log into my old account. Considering all the achievements and play time on the old account I think everyone knows how much of a pain it is to start over. With that being said just be aware that if you have any issues with this game don't count on getting any proper customer service even within game purchases. I understand its a pandemic right now but I sure Hi-Rez has plenty of remote workers that can fix this issue and any others that other customers have.
28328,"Bad Game, very bad. I hope everyone at Evil Mojo quits and does something else, because, wow, this game sucks."
28329,Game is great fun. But too bad my PS4 items aren't ported over.

From the age of 4 I was taught to never take anything for granted, I grew up fairly poor. I was living my life on the farm when a tornado came through and destroyed our entire farm, we had no means of making money now, and no money to rebuild. I did what any boy my age would do and I took up bounty hunting, which was very fruitful until my late teenage years. I then moved on to be a contractural assassin, where I have stayed for 40 years. I have many hours in this game and I can affirm that the rush I get from playing sneaky characters is similar to what I first felt 40 years ago."

28394,"The game itself is fun, but their support is terrible. Me and my wife started playing on the switch and got this on PC so we had both options. One to play on the go and one to play at home. They support cross progression, but if you set up your account incorrectly (read, follow a series of arcane directions) you can no longer link your account with steam. 

We've reached out to paladin's support a week ago, and have yet to hear back from them."
28395,"I wanted to like this game. I really did. It's FUN, when it works. I'm on a brand new PC and 500Mbps internet and have constant problems.

Problems I have experienced...
1.) The server-side of the game constantly goes down booting everyone back to main menu. 

2.) The client crashes a lot too kicking you to main menu or even to desktop.
      I'm told this frequently happens with updates but gets fixed/patched. It shouldn't be this way. 

3.) Bots. Lots of Bots. If your friends loose connection... which they will. They get turned into bots who even have the name of your friend. There is no way to know your friends are even gone unless your on Mic and they stop talking.

4.) Combine these issues and your often discovering all real players either left the match or crashed and you're only playing with bots. This isn't fun and drastically ruins a match due to the matchmaking AI(?) of the bots.

5.) The refer a friend and be referred by a friend features do not work at all for me. Even contacted support, twice, and never heard back. No point in offering incentives to play with your friends when the incentives don't work, oh and your friends always getting disconnected and turning into bots."

28411,Always fun with friends
28412,"Never ever ever play this pathetic excuse for a game.

1) Graphics is obscure, poor, pale.
2) Sounds are not immersive, low, bad.
3) There is no kill cam, you have no idea what and how killed you.

And now the dumbest things I've ever seen in computer games:
4) When someone in your team leaves - game hides this from you. It just replaces player with a bot, who is running into a wall and doing nothing. They made it so that ""players don't tilt seeing that someone left"". So you, like an idiot, try hard to win a game, not even understanding that you play 4 vs 5 or 3 vs 5.
5) When a competitive game starts, only 1 person out of 5 can ban heroes. 4 people are just unlucky and don't participate in the process.
6) Servers are just disconnecting you from the game. First, you start freezing, teleporting. Then the game shows that you are dead. They you either respawn or just find yourself in the main menu. And the match you were just playing just vaporises, like it never happened.

The most bad, cheap, bugged and poor online first person game I've ever played during last 15 years. Avoid at all costs!"

28420,"While not the most impressive shooter, Paladins manages to bring a good experience considering its price point. The game is pretty well balanced, but the balancing could be better as there are some very bad classes that you would never use for any reason. 
Again, overall a pretty good game and something I would for sure recommend you try out."
28421,"its way more awesome than fortnite and we know thats true because u dont have to search for  weapons or healing items instead u can heal by hiding then wait for its automatic healing, plus each champion has their own abilities! and one special  attack. plus no sweats!"
28422,"It's a pretty fun game. I get no enjoyment out of playing it by myself but me and my friends have a blast whenever we're on it together. I am highly annoyed by how powerful some of these champions are. There shouldn't be a ""These champions are the best, don't play as these though they suck"" thing going on here. They should all be balanced, and I know that getting them to that point isn't so easy but if the current champions are unbalanced then stop making more! Nonetheless, this game is entirely free and doesn't sling a bunch of micro-transactions you NEED to buy which I respect highly. You should definitely give it a try."
28423,Excellent game but itll be nice if there's a separate server for indian region but anyway i play on europe server and i love this game and i play this game mostly on Nintendo switch and thanks for the amazing port
28424,"As with all Free to play games it suffers with a good number of horrible, toxic players. You know the kind, they claim to be excellent at the game but always seem to be in loosing matches (go figure,right?)

It also seems to suffer with a few persistent bugs/server issues at the start of every new battlepass, presumably as more players come back to get into the new content.

Other than that though the game is great fun, particularly with a group of friends (although ranked mode is oddly maximum 2 player teams...) there are a good number of interesting champions and ifinite replayability.

of course there are in game purchases, but that's what you expect from F2P games."
28425,despite having so many bugs and faults. Paladins is one of the most enjoyable game i have ever played in fps genre. Give it a shot. Even is not that much of a rewarding game for new player base but still if u can kind of understand the mechanics(which is pretty basic and easy) u will start enjoying it.
28426,It's a fun game if and has a selection of characters that fits your playstyle
28427,cool game

28429,awesome  game dope
28430,"The game is amazing. It does have bugs like any other game (omegalul) but overall the game is fluid, great champs, like any others there is always a meta but at the same time that matters at most at the higher comp if at all. Give it a try!"
28431,I love this game.
28432,It's a really good game and for free I think it is really fun.

28439,"I actually enjoyed this game. It's pretty fun and a great alternative to a first-person shooter. My only downsides is some of the crashes the game has when playing on Switch and my computer taking a while to download this game on Steam. Other than that, pretty good."
28440,"the gam is fun but some characters are realy broken so i hope they fix it
"
28441,"Very good game! 
In my opinion only need more attention from the dev team, and some constant updates as we had in a few years...

Definitely a great competitor to overwatch!"
28442,"Fun, Fairly distructive, compeltive,"
28443,"You have to think, great game."
28444,Better than Overwatch

28447,Fix the servers thanks. Otherwise brilliant
28448,this game is the antonym of balance
28449,"This game is this weird kind of bad, where you actually love the game itself but hate playing it. Let me explain...

I have over 1 300 hours in this game and found lots of great people in it, with whom I love to play with but... the toxicity of playerbase in paladins is just damn too high. It is so high that I tend to constantly find new great people to play it with, just to find out later that they quit it after investing few months of their time, out of sheer frustration. And it roots from two things - lots of lost games due things players cannot control and toxicity around them.

Toxicity is actually created by the game itself. Just look at this mechanic:

1) You wait 1-2 minutes to find lobby after queuing. 
2) Then you spend around 5 minutes (sometimes even longer) to choose champions and disscuss strategy a bit. 
3) Then you wait around 1-2 minute for it to load. 
4) Then you wait a bit for match to start while you prepare in spawn room for match which last around:
-   8 minutes, if literally enemies let you push objectives without almost any struggle,
- 15 minutes if one side is winning but youhave some nice fighting going on.
- 25 minutes if both sides are so balanced that neither can get point till last possible minute.

That gives us between 15 minutes to 34 for one game. And here comes the problem... sometimes you actually don't want to play that particular match. And you cannot quit. Maybe you get troll who picked in that first 2 minutes of game 3th tank and you know for 300% it will not work. Maybe someone disconects in first minutes of match and stand in spawn room not moving for rest of the match. Maybe he is actually not afk, but just writting on chat how bad others play and he won't help team.... etc etc etc. But you cannot quit - there is just no option to do it normally. So you get stuck sometimes even for a half an hour in matches you just constatly think about quiting match. But if you do, both your team and you will suffer for it - they need to finish match with constant disadvantage of having 4vs5 which is impossible situation if enemies are not total noobs, and you will get banned from queuing for next matches. That punishment actually gets bigger and bigger with each time you quit (it can even get longer time that one hour). If you play ranked game, you also lose points... which is extra frustrating since if you stayed you had small chance to not lose them, but if you quit you will lose them for sure. So you start to blame others. 

It became so bad recently that every second or third match is won or lost due to having AFK, trolling, disconnected or just refusing to play dude in one of the teams. 

To sum up, this game mechanic create vicious circle: 
1) Some people get disconnected due to internet problems, game crashing (also happens) or just pick wrong champion in the lobby before match started. This makes all other 4 people stick in an unbalanced, frustrating match fo an half an hour.
2) Next match you just get inexperienced teammates... and you lose again.  
3) Repeat that few times -> people will actually think they are doing good job by flaming other people mistakes. At least they feel a bit better and other frustrated people in team will agree with them.
4) More toxic players, create more matches with first situation, but now its due to them trolling or just refusing to play.

This create more and more toxicity.

And it is such a shame that it happens in this particular game. It has some really simple, easy and cool mechanics to grasp but also has many niuances harder to understand. Thx to that you can quickly get into playing it but also don't run into problem that you cannot improve your playstyle - there is always something you could do better or maybe way to help your team to win. It has impressive number of different champions, with more comming every now and then. And even the champions themselves can be played in totally different styles since each get 3 talents which hugely change how you use their skills, then you have cards system where you create different loadouts allowing you to emphasize different strenghs of your character. This allows you to not only adjust them to your playstyle, but also adjust them according to what enemies can do. Thanks to that, the game require some more strategic thinking than many others shooters... on the flip side, lots of characters and options for them create many unbalanced situations. And with such a huge number of them, many good options are actually regarded by people as bad, because they require some different playstyles to actually benefit from. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In short - great gameplay with huge problems of toxicity created by game mechanics itself, with impressive variety of playstyle which gets a bit clunky due to unbalanced characters.

Right now, I can only recommend playing it with few friends. Playing solo will be way too frustrating.

Pros:
+ It is free
+ Addicting, gives you nice rush of adrenaline you want more 
+ Simple, easy, cool mechanics
+ Cards and talent system allowing unique playstyles and variety
+ Heavy emphasis on teamplay 
+ Impresive list of champions with very unique playstyles
+ Include playstyles involving something else that pure reflex and godly accuracy 
+ Punishes stupidity and reward strategic thinking

Cons:
- It is free -> no cost allows banned players to just create new account
- Addicting, gives you nice rush of adrenaline you want more... and more
- Toxicity created by game mechanics
- Every second or third match is lost or won due to AFK, trolling or flaming player.
- More than half of talents and cards are either bad or totally useless
- Not very balanced champions
- While it has anti-cheat protection, you still see cheaters around
- No options to quit or forfeit match
- No mechanic to replace disconnected player or even-out unbalanced matches
- Time consuming, it is hard to play casually"

28473,"This game is dog butt. my first game in i top frag. i feel like this game is just an overwatch clone with a playerbase that consists of people that have the skill level of a nursing home patient with parkinson's. When i first tried loading into the game and creating an account it took me 5 minutes because it wouldnt let me use the name ""GamingGrandpa"" with several other similar variants. The username ""gamingGrandpa"" was not allowed because it contained words that are not suitable for the game. Even after I found a name that worked it said that i was using the wrong game version, even though it was updated to the correct version. Along with many squishy characters and characters that you pay for this game does not feel worth playing. if you want a good game that is similar in style play something like Tf2 or if you are willing to spend money on a game overwatch is far more worth it. This game lacks character strengths and weaknesses. if there were characters that had counters to one another, the game would be much better. any character in this game has a heavy chance of killing another character becuase no character is heavily countered by another. Dont take my review and use it as your own view, try the game yourself and see if you like it, maybe you might."

28532,"One of those 'easy to learn, hard to master' games. Reminded me so much of TF2, which is a massive thumbs up from my side. If you are a casual player like myself, you will enjoy this one as a match tends to last between 5-10 minutes. There are plenty of classes, 45 to be exact. So the game has plenty of replay value. 

The games are definitely exciting, i have had plenty of rapid heartbeat moments especially at the 'king of the hill' mode. I can see myself playing this game  alot in the near future. Definitely recommended."

28558,"As someone from Overwatch, this is actually surprisingly fun. I put it off since it first released because it just looked like a shitty rip-off of Overwatch. But it seems like it actually turned into something of it's own and I'm having a great time with it. For something that's free, I highly recommend it if you're interested in this genre."

28564,so good
28565,Great Overwatch-like. Tons of heros with interesting and fun abilities. Everything in this game can be grinded towards and earned without spending a dime. My only complaint is the furry bait heros and skins.

28572,"One of the best Hero Shooters in 2020.  Except for the evil monetization of cosmetics everything in the game is fair and fun to indulge in.  Most of the community is friendly (you can always find toxic gamers in every game) and I have made quite a few friends ingame because I couldnt make my friends irl to try this game.  All the champions are fun to play and easy to pick up.  The combat is deep enough and intuitive.  You get better by being smart and by playing over time. Did I mention that there are some really cool cosmetics in this game?  Its just sad that they are hidden behind some cleverly designed chests that might make you shell out more money than you initially thought you would.  Some of the cool ones can also be purchased without spending a single dollar though, so that counts for something."
28573,MUY BUEN JUEGO
28574,"its the best game for me    <3
"
28575,gr8 fun. getting on me and have not had so much fun on a multiplayer fps game since goldeneye and halo. (told you i was getting on lol) there has to be about 40+ plus characters all feel unique enough and there are plenty of easy to use hero's that noob's like me can still do some damage with. It clearly takes sometime and effort to get good with the hero's that have a more complicated skill set and setting up the right card boosters to suit yours and your teams play style is also a fun aspect of the game. recommend to anyone who likes team basesd shooters
28576,"Probably my favourite game, but it has too many bugs so pls fix them hirez ty <3"
28577,Very good free to play action fps. If you like the game you can buy the pack of all the champions/characters plus the one to be released. There are a few balance issues here and there but nothing very insane

There are many characters to choose from, and each has three perks to choose from, which can completely change their playstyle, You only start with a few, characters, like R6 Siege, meaning you have things to work towards and unlock as you progress through the game. Each champion has loads of cosmetics, and the game is regularly updated. The matchmaking is really good too, when you do get matched against a lvl 499 Maeve, you'll have a level 499 Lex on your team. It's completely free, much better than Overwatch and less sweaty than siege, and zero bots unlike TF2. Again, It's free - give it a go."

28670,"The game itself isnt bad, its a funny game to play with friends or when you dont have anything to do, but if you want something to focus in, i'll list just a little of the game problems, and thats why i wouldnt recommend it now:

- The ranked Matchmaking system is broken, a low elo player can play against a full team of GM and diamonds, wich isnt fun for both parts;
- The Devs dont care too much about the game lately, they just show up skins, battlepasses and sometimes a new champion, They already stated that we'll not have any events this year, so if you played Rise of Furia or something like that and are returning to the game, know that you'll not have anything like that in this year sadly;
- The Att cycle is about 3 months, wich is kinda bad for an online game;
- Some unbalanced champions most of the time didnt even get touched by the devs;
- The Game is full of bugs and server problems, they removed features that they said would fix some bugs but guess what? The bugs still there, the server is at its worse point, a couple of days ago i played a match wich everyone except the tank of my team got stuck on the champion selection screen ( Enemy team included );

These are just some of the problems, if you want to see the real madness come to the discussions session of the game, its a mess, people with login problems, crash problems, lag problems, some people trying to help with the champions balance ( generally the devs doesnt care ), what i have to say is, if you want to come back to the game right now, its not the time, maybe it'll be when Evil Mojo decide that they dont want to kill the game, if you're a new player, maybe you could try it yourself, but dont give huge expectations. If for a miracle the game solve this problems i'll change my review, but for now, thats all folks ;P

28681,"Awesome game, have about 450 hours on switch, community is fun, sometimes i hate the focus but that s the way the cookie crumbles. Some champs are a bit overpowered, devs update the game very often so it s never dull. the Lore is AMAZING, but the best part... IT S FREE!!!!"
28682,Timeconsuming trash ranking matchmaking do not recommend to anyone trash game waste my money and time
28683,"As of 7/19/2020, Paladins is my most played game on Steam with about 700 hours [i] (I know that compared to most people on steam, this isn't much, I have a busy life outside of gaming 20 hours a day) [/i]. The reason for this is because I can proudly say that [i] [b] this game is FANTASTIC [/b] [/i] and definitely worth playing or at least trying. I do of course think that there are things that make this game far from perfect, which I will get into later on in this review.
To start off, I very much appreciate all of the customization that this game has to offer. In Paladins [i] (as of July, 2020) [/i] there are 45 champions in the game. Each champion can be customized with a loadout that allows for 5 different unique passives to be upgraded to amplify abilities and base stats, making almost every player unique with how they can play a specific champion. Players who have the mentality that there should be one type of optimal loadout are just wrong, and I recommend that those people go find another hero shooter without this mechanic if you dread it so much. On top of customizing passive effects, there is a buy menu that is simple to work with and isn't as complex as League of Legends [i] (especially when LoL has 175+ items, compared to the 16 in Paladins). [/i] I am comfortable saying that this is very helpful, simplifying the buying process allows for better decision making mid game, in turn making the experience more fun.
I also really like the developer's creative skills. Evil Mojo [i] (as bad as they may be, which I will again expand upon very soon) [/i] has a great team designing very cool skins, battle pass rewards, and new champions to slap people with. Another fantastic trait behind this game is its vast amount of lore. I've struggled to get involved in the game's lore and story, as I find it more fun to just play the game for how it is. Although I haven't thoroughly educated myself in the story that guides the realm, I still appreciate that there is a whole team behind putting together lore to make the game and characters more interesting.
The gamemodes and fast paced gameplay that most first person hero shooters provide is definitely present here. All of the characters have unique abilities and roles [i] (other than Vivian, Tyra, and Victor, I find it hard to differentiate the three with how they are designed and played by most players). [/i] On top of the loadout customization that I touched on earlier, players can even customize champions that are intended to have supporting roles on a team to turn them into damage based champion, making it important for players to understand how characters can be used and to expect the unexpected. I also think that the game balance is done well, and that the meta is in a good place right now.
[b] NOW, [/b] everything above is what makes this game great, and I would even go as far to say that Paladins, because of all the cool stuff it has, is better than Overwatch [i] (feel free to ignite the comments section of this post on fire, you will be ignored based on negativity PepeLaugh). [/i] BUT, there are of course many things that hold this game back from truly being better than Overwatch.
The are countless bugs to this game. If you don't encounter a single bug during a one hour session, then congrats, you basically just won the f**king lottery. Most of the bugs are minor, and they usually don't cause much damage to your game, but it is still very unfortunate to see that who ever is coding this game clearly has no idea how to troubleshoot problems and fix them. Most of the major bugs do get patched, but the minor ones that are a nuisance to deal with remain, and it is unfortunate that players have to deal with it. I've always found it hard to explain to new players that they are experiencing a bug infested game, because sometimes it can be hard to notice and easy to say that ""it is just an implemented feature of the game"", when in reality it is probably unintended and that the devs are simply too lazy to fix the problem.
While I'm slamming the devs for not being able fix their game mechanically, I'll also say that the developers have kept the respect for the community to a minimal. The last thing I remember them doing something important that involved the community was for the community themed battle pass at the beginning of 2020, where they held a Google forms poll to determine which champions should get skins for the pass. Other than that, they've been taking feedback on Reddit that they don't even respond to or care about half the time. The activity on twitter that the devs also engage in is very unhealthy and makes the community look very bad. They're toxic people on social media who choose to add to the fires that bring down their game rather than to put them out.
Finally, I would like to end this review on a good note and say that Paladins really is a truly fun game to play. The devs are bad [i] (but not as bad as FreeJam PepeLaugh) [/i] but the people behind designing the game have a great creative outlet here, and it definitely shows how passionate these artists are with fantastic looking champions and a fulfilling story that brings the game to life. Unless the devs pull a Robocraft catastrophe, I don't see myself not playing this game for a long time. I will surely post another review if it ever does go down that path, but for now I am excited to say that this game is great. I recommend you play it, and I am definitely glad that it is my most played game on Steam.
Thanks for reading this review.

28738,"The characters are pretty cool, and it's pretty easy compared to other games, which makes this game good for people who aren't interested in games that require hundreds of hours of practice in order to be okay at the game. It works pretty well as a casual game, but as free games go I would definitely say that Team Fortress 2 is a better casual game. Paladins is still great when you just want to sit down and be competitive, but not super sweaty. The game engine is nice, and mobility is used really well in this game. I just wish you didn't have to grind just to own and play specific characters, and considering that quests don't make you much money it's kind of lame that I have to grind for a week just to buy a single champion. Still a great game though. I really wish that they would flesh out the ""story"" a lot more, I would love to see a comic series like they did with TF2 or an animated short of Lex and Androxus before Androxus got cursed, like a little buddy cop thing. The character descriptions paint a pretty cool world, I would love to see more of that. Overall, a pretty good game."

28749,one of the best FREE team player games on steam market
28750,Played a fair amount on PS4 it's better than Overwatch?
28751,"So, I have around 1k hours of play time in this game with my other accounts combined. 
Casuals are fun if you do not give a damn about the team compositions. 
Rankeds are draining the life out of your soul either way. The matchmaking is so broken, diamonds and silvers end up in the same team, people openly say that they were banned but they can log in on another account and continue trolling the matches. 
Also, there are endless bugs in the game, I know it's a free game but the thing is since BETA, the game has just gotten worse. 
The community is toxic, competitive games are unbalanced, CHAMPS are unbalanced... So I just uninstalled.
This is not even enjoyable anymore, if Hi-Rez start to think about more about other stuff than skins for players to buy, maybe I will play again."
28752,Very Much Like Overwatch The Game... I'd Recommened It..

Now every time I play a game I will randomly crash, the graphics get fucked up. pixelated and freeze; I am forced to unplug my PC to fix this problem. I have attempted multiple times to create a ticket to resolve this issue but it seems whenever I try making a ticket, I can't submit it and I haven't the foggiest why. Avoid this game at all cost if you value your other games, I am now having to completely wipe my HDD and lose old purchased games due to downloading this fucking game."
28760,good enough
28761,Fun Game
28762,Basically free overwatch
28763,gewd
28764,"To be honest, this game is good, like really good. It's not the best, but it doesn't get enough credit that it deserves. When it was first released, they drew a good amount of inspiration from the oh-so popular OverWatch. But since then, it has verged off into a different game of it's own. The card system is really interesting and gives you different ways to play the same class. So in the end, the vast cast of characters becomes even more vast. Also, don't get me started with the weapon and gun skins, because they are amazing. Now this, is were we get into the bad parts. The Battle Pass is ""eh"" and is only mildly interesting. If you buy anything via. crystals, it is way overpriced. I think that's about it; Oh right, it's free! So if you are interested, there's now reason not to get it ;)"
28765,cool
28766,Play Overwatch or LITERALLY any other shooter instead
28767,"After a lot more playtime, I cannot recommend this game. This would be playable if:
- Evil Moji fixed their servers. I cannot count the number of games that were doomed from the start by something that isn't exactly lag, but means you can't jump, are killed around corners, and can't use some character abilities reliably. 
- Matchmaking stayed within continent. Why for the love of god would I want to play an entire team that doesn't speak my language and is 500 ms behind?
- Matchmaking matched with skill. About 90% of the time, if the above conditions haven't ruined the game already, the matchmaking will do the rest. Its a wipe in one direction or the other. Really unfortunate, because its not fun to steamroll other people, and it's not fun to get completely rolled either.

It's maybe 1 out of 100 games that are just fun with no complaints. I really wanted to love this game, and did for a while, but the more champions I unlocked, the more the flaws stood out. Some abilities require perfect timing to use. Hugh lag, or server jankiness, absolutely destroys a game. I was hoping these would be fixed as time went on, but they've only gotten worse. The game is being abandoned by the developer in favor of Rogue Company it seems.

2/10. Would not recommend."

28777,okay i cannot be the only person... this game is awesome beats out almost any other free game i know. but are you serious you cant give a team a point for defending... we ran a game and got objective 2 times but they defended it and got an even score just for us to get beat because they captured 1 time!!! If this is not a clear flaw im not sure what is......
28778,"its pretty good, a little unstable when playing, but other than that its good"
28779,fun game
28780,ss
28781,dope
28782,Literal garbage.
28783,"I redwalled for the first time ever yesterday and I am officially *this* close to wanting to shoot myself in the face with every firearm known to man!

It sincerely baffles me how Ranked (casual too, but that's fine because it's casual) is a complete and total clusterfuck of braindead idiots who don't even know what the word ""Objective"" means against a team that for all I can tell are literally God's gift to Paladins?

It doesn't help that the braindead idiots hardly speak any English (or hardly speak at all), instalock one of 6 champs (Viktor, Koga, Tyra, Androxus, Vivian, Lex), and then die to the most obvious, easy to counter garbage. I actually made it a point to only get kills with my reloads and Broadsides as Scuttle Dredge in a game of Casual KOTH and sure enough, I was able to clean up, but the infuriating thing is, my team was going to lose had I not been wiping the enemy. We had an AFK player as well.

I am sincerely confused as to how bad players in this game really are, considering I (usually) have the most objective time in the entire match, the best KDA on my team, and have the highest number for a role that I'm not even playing (if an Inara outdamages a Viktor there is something VERY wrong) on my team.

I blame the tutorial mainly, since it mentions jackshit of how to actually play the game and uses *VIKTOR* as an example of what the game has to offer.

Am I alone? Is this game truly full of idiots? Maybe I'm just bad and am projecting?

Game is still fun regardless though. A bit heavy-handed on the furry skins but that's Hi-Rez for you"
28784,"They have always done a decent job of keeping the game balanced, despite what others say. If you get bored, just start a new character and it's fresh again. Community isn't terrible. My favorite multiplayer game. It always feels like skill prevails."

- Very poor customer service
- Very poor game servers

28834,I love this game. It's competative and fun at the same time.  I recommend playing with a stack of 3 or more if you're planning to win lol
28835,"fun

28836,"It's a really fun game don't get me wrong, but the bugs just make this game unplayable."
28837,It's alright
28838,its fun and much better than overwatch

28840,very fun and competitive game good for those who like action packed games with a lot of skins characters and dances

28843,"Its fun and runs on low end pcs on min graphics 
its pretty much a free slightly run down overwatch."
28844,"If you enjoy Overwatch, then this is the next best thing to it! It's FREE unlike Overwatch and well the concepts are all the same I think. There's also a battle pass component to the back so you can unlock more stuff if you're into collecting. 

Pros: 
- Free to play
- Hero shooter
- Fun alone or with friends


Cons:
- Quality of the game isn't the best
- Sometimes you lose champions you paid for using in-game coins
--> For a game that has been out for awhile, you'd think they would fix some bugs but I guess not. 

Overall, it's worth a try. If you don't like it no big deal. :)

28845,fun asf
28846,"Honestly, I love the characters, especially Bomb King, the gameplay for each character is unique, but the game feels like it's in Alpha, yet they fully released it as if it was finished."

28894,Overwatch with more variety and customization plus less stuns.

28925,"I like the ability to customise the way you play a champion and the weapon overlap. In comparison to it's competitor Overwatch, it's just as fun for casuals, if not more fun, because of how many champions exist and the lack of a role lock. However, it's got a lot more bugs than Overwatch and the custom games aren't as  fun but overall a good game for casual players.

Competitive players should just buy Overwatch or download Valorant."
28926,"I wish it showed hours played for all platforms, because this game tops it for me for sure! Oh boy, where to begin with this amazing game. I have played it on Xbox since the week it came out in beta and I immediately fell in love. I love the character card loadouts and how custom you can make your build versus the next person, and to add to that the legendary cards and items to buy in game make it all the more tailored to your own gaming style. There are a bunch of character choices with amazing skin options, fun emotes, and fantastic maps to play on. They constantly update and add more skins, characters, emotes, maps, and actually care about character balance and the communities opinions. I think this is one of the best team based games you could get into, definitely give it a try!"
28927,Fun game

28943,"You want a  game the dev's ignore? Holy hell you found the right place!
Want to hear racist insults hurled all over the place? This is the game for you!
You want to be in a game so mismatched you're wondering whats going on? YOU FOUND THE GAME! 
Holy crap you'll have so much fun wondering why your team will have 2 silvers 1 bronze and 2 golds vs 4 plats and 1 diamond!
Come play the game that came out before overwatch and had potential to be better, but instead the devs tried to be more like OW (they accused OW of ripping ash off)
There is a reason this game is called buggadins, but don't worry you can always count on them to have a Battle Pass with 20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 new skins and no actual fixes for prior existing issues within the game.
Have fun watching characters so obviously broken you're going to wonder if the devs even bother playing this game.
This game is so broken and rage inducing any game from your past that you hate you will love after playing this pile of bugs.



Play overwatch
Player Apex
Play TF2
Play Valorant
Play Fortnite
Hell play Fallout 76 before this

But for all thats holy avoid this game

hey this game was great in the beginning, just not now."
28944,great game for all ages good 3d modeled game and great gameplay
28945,Fun
28946,"this game is pretty decent considering the fact that it's free, but it takes so long to grind all the champions and there are just so way too many game breaking bugs. Not to mention all the crashes that happen just make this game pretty frustrating to play. One more thing I'd like to mention is that matchmaking is completely and utterly broken, matching bronze players with top 100 players isn't even surprising.

I would say that overwatch is a better game, but if you 

1. Can stand some bugs

2. Can't afford Overwatch

or 3, Play on a toaster

give the game a shot i guess."
28947,LOVE Paladins
28948,"the game is fine except for a map that is enormous for no reason at all and it sucks, completetly ruined my experience"
28949,a lot of bugs and unbalanced sht :)
28950,"Surprisingly bad and fucking awful for a 60$ game, also full cross-platform play is ass"
28951,"very good game but the fact that high ranked players come in and play with lower ranked players or even new players ruins the game, how ever if you get a game that is fair its very enjoyable."
28952,Is 3rd Person mode back yet?
28953,many f2p rewards and fun game for players.. vast tactics and skills for various playing styles..
28954,if you are bored play paladins :)

28956,its a good game to certain type of gamers if you like overwatch realm royale or valorant i would play this game but if you like cod fortnite or r6 im not sure if this is the game for you but it could be possible since i was a r6 player and i liked this game a lot overall i'de give this game a 7/10
28957,Fun !
28958,"ITS VEY FUN BUT ITS A LITTLE BIT BORING YOU NEED TO ADD MORE MAPS AND PLAYERS EITH OTHER ABILITIES

It is still awsome game tho"
28960,trash game
28961,awesome game
28962,I have played this game alot in the past and it's still one of my favorite games. But somehow i think it has becoma a little bit worse. I still can recommend it for u guys.

28968,This is a great game with many different characters to play with as well as tons of different skins for each characters. I kinda miss the best play at the end of the game though. It's still an awesome game and I highly recommend it :D
28969,"despite the game being mediocre and had lost it's originality since the release of undercut fuckboy viktor, you won't find cheaters and the queue time for casual is decently fast.

update:
this game is dying with servers like these. I guess they focus too much to social justice and representation bs instead of user experience."
28970,"fun game
"
28971,"if you have no money, this is your game.
A lot of times it feels unbalanced and matchmaking is broken but hey, free overtwatch."

good game though willl play again 7/10"
28973,Very nice game! i recommend you to download it NOW!!
28974,Mwah
28975,Best Game
28976,Truely amazing game
28977,"I really have nothing that bad to say about this game. As someone who has played both Paladins and Overwatch a fair bit I would not recommend this over Overwatch, because Paladins feels like a totally different game to me now. It might be a bit hard to learn, since there are a lot of heroes, but overall the game is nice. 7/10."
28978,It's a pretty okay game. As an Overwatch player I do enjoy how refreshing this game is compared to the stupid meta I play against pretty much every game. UI can definitely be improved and the battle pass can be done away with.
28979,thats a really great game if u want to relax whit ur friends
28980,Overwatch but lest homo
28981,this game is fun but u have to get to know ur character well and the card ability system is great
28982,"One of my absolute favourite games ever. People like to compare it to Overwatch, and since I've played both games I can tell you that I much prefer this game.

This game may not look as good as OW, and is definetly buggier, it feels less polished. But to put it simply, The polished good-looking state of overwatch is overshadowed by it's lack of balance and proper gameplay. On the other hand, paladins trades graphics for depth: An item store to add a feeling of progression to the game, no paper/scissors/rock action by switching champs mid game, personalization of characters trough very customizable loadouts and the choice of a game-changing talent. Also Paladins has more champions than Overwatch, and is much more balanced: while some champions are a little bit too powerful, it's not by much and to an extent every champion (apart from one or two, like skye) can be viable if played right or in the right situation. Somewhat frequent updates too although it feels like the glory days are long gone and so is the budget: new content consists of just skins in a battlepass, and sometimes a new ranked split/season, occasionnaly a champion... We used to get new gamemodes as events and such but it seems like Hi-Rez is done with throwing money onto this game...

Whatever, I still recommend this game, loads of fun, frustrating at times but it's the type of game that you keep coming back to despite the alleged flaws that it has had for years on."
28983,It's fun!
28984,"Played it for a bit. Couldn't try the comp matches though, as there were none to begin with."
28985,It is simple
28986,paladins is one of the best games you can play with your friends or alone you have a lot of cool heroes to play with and different maps too.
28987,didn't load very excited for the game but it didn't work so ill try again but if i does not work then im very disapointed
28988,"Its like free overwatch

28997,This game is fire!
28998,GOOD GAME YOU SHOULD PLAY AND ITS A RALLY GOOD GAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
28999,I have over a thousand hours on Overwatch whitch this game is constantly compared to and the 2 are not the same and paladins fixes some of the problems overwatch has and has an inherintly harder system to break as agregiously as overwatch does. the system still has some work needed for matchmaking but the games aren't to feels bad for losses.
29000,epic
29001,its fun but yet there is so dumb players who dont pick healers when they are last pick and no healers on the team

29007,"Freaking amazing! So many characters for you to choose from. Multiple different play styles and when they make skins, it's like they've created an entirely new character to play with. Music is amazing and it's cross platform. They have a ranked system for you to test your skills against the big dogs and if you gather enough good players in a party, you can have a lot of fun with teamwork."
29008,Great game
29009,Really gets rid of your happiness. Not recommended at all!
29010,mmmmmmmmm
29011,"It's a great game, only suggestion would be to fix the servers."
29012, When i first played this my friend only had a switch and this was one of the only shooting games we could play. i gave it a try and i love it. if you want overwatch but have no money get this.

29018,This Game was a fun game but they ruined it also if you think about buying anything in this game don't just go buy Overwatch its just a better game
29019,Paladins is a good multiplayer game im new to it on pc but i have had it on ps4 for about 3 years now and i enjoyed the game alot while playing with my friends. i recommend this game no game is a 10 out of 10 but i would rate this a 8 out of ten

29027,"Add huge balancing issues, unfun pricing and overall economy to an already messy game from another development team, flavor it with junky mechanics and bugs. Nice job, it's Paladins

Every time i launch this game i wonder which common bug i get next:Game simply not loading and fucking me over with blank white screen while still playing menu sounds, log me out out of my in-game account or reset some of my bounty skins/completely fuck up bounty store.

And when it comes to balancing, Paladins' already unbalanced mess of overpowered hitscan champions gets weirder every patch. In the latest patch they nerfed already underperforming champions like:
Io who has the worst performance in healing other than Grohk, but pretty high winrate weights it out i guess? 
Koga's damage which doesn't make sense since both his DPS and win chart is somewhere lower than average and i personally didn't see many Kogas anyway."
29028,Nice battle game
29029,I would say its a good Overwatch copy considering its free definetly would play it again
29030,"Freemium game chocked full of sketchy psychological tactics that try to get you to spend money on it. Getting cosmetics is all but impossible unless you spend money on ""shards"" (funny money) to buy lootboxes, or a battle pass. You don't own all the champions when you start, which wouldn't be a big deal if you didn't need them to complete seasonal quests. The game never stops bombarding you with ads to buy in-game content and passes off paid content as free content (until the last minute) regularly."
29031,Mantabe bangaw
29032,Nice Game.I start to play this game on 2017
29033,well yes but actually no :(
29034,"It's really fun, especially with friends and there's a ton of different playstyles for each champion. It's free. It's extremely well optimized. However unlike overwatch, you have to unlock all the champions with coins which takes ages to grind for by playing matches. If you want, the champions pack is available for around 30 dollars and unlocks everything for you. Skins in this game cost a fortune and there are a couple bugs now and then. Not to mention, playing casual is a nightmare since you'll often get low level teammates. They also got rid of POG which kind of sucks. Graphics in this game is somewhat ok and there isn't a lore to this game at all. Playing ranked in any country other than the US takes ages to queue and ping is horrible since you need to switch servers. If you have the money I'd just recommend Overwatch. It's better in every way :)."
29035,Player Disconnected :)
29036,Fun
29037,"Absolutely Fantastic game. having well over 30 hrs in both Paladins and Overwatch, i can comfortably say; Paladins is the more enjoyable experience. I should clarify however, i do come from Call of Duty style shooters, where customization is more than abundant. So going into Overwatch for the first time, it felt bare, and void of grindable content. Sure you can grind for in-game currency to unlock skins for Heroes and such.
But there's a problem; Let's look at Call of Duty for a second. currently, there are 104 unique camoflage patterns earnable via weapon progression and challenges, signifying one's mastery over a given weapon, or in the instances of Plattinum and Demascus; multiple, and all. Now, lets go back to Paladins. Each and every character has Mastery Champion skins, weapon skins, titles and more, earnable via Champion progression and Challenges. Better yet... It's FTP. so i mean, why not give it a shot?"
29038,good game? yes
29039,"yes

29043,"What can I say about this game? Other than Hi-Rez trying to shove  money-draining cosmetics down my throat (which they succeeded in), this game is terribly fun... as in bad for your health fun because you'll be sitting in your chair playing this for hours. There are so many champions, all of which have unique skins and custom abilities (their cards). Most importantly, this is a free game! If you are into pvp even slightly, give this unique game a chance."

29059,"[h1] Unique Hero Shooter [/h1]

Paladins is a very fun hero shooter with a play style for any type of player. I would say this game is a fun and interesting hero shooter with amazing creativity. The one draw back for this game is that it's owned by Hi-Rez Studios, [i] who aren't exactly very reputable [/i]. This game does have it's [i] fair share [/i] of glitches, but it is still a fun game to play. At the time of writing this, the game has a decent sized fan base so I don't see it leaving the market or shutting down very soon. I came from console and since its cross- play, you can still play with your frined."

29086,"I've tried to play Paladins like 4 times now. It's bad. You'll get afk/bot teammates, the matchmaking structure is bad, the play patterns are super linear. I don't actually know that the game has an upside besides being free."

29100,Not as good as overwatch
29101,"Great game, people say it's like Overwatch. It's not but from the surface level it does look like Overwatch. Now that I've got that out of the way it's a great game full of diverse champions. Yet a couple of them are overpowered. Bye now <3"
29102,"If you like League of Legends but want something that is first-person and doesn't have snowball mechanics or loopholes, this is it! I've played other games like Overwatch but I like the theme of Paladins better. 10/10 recommend!"

29120,"Paladins is similar in playstyle to Overwatch, but much slower. It is a really fun core gameplay loop. The champions are fun to play, the abilities feel powerful and mostly balanced and it's just enjoyable to play. The customization of different loadouts for champions sets it apart from Overwatch. In my opinion it's way more fun to tweak the champion of your choice to your playstyle, than it is to pick a static champion type like Overwatch.  

The downside can be the toxic community. You often get caught between players who take the game way too seriously or those who don't take it seriously enough. Team comp is very important and so many people just don't understand it. You'll see a lot of damage mains blaming heals or frontline, lots of people who don't understand the strategy of the game but think that they do, flame others for not ""playing right."" You'll hear complaining and claims that they're carrying you based on raw stats, but don't be fooled. Stats do matter, but they do not tell the whole story. You can have 100k healing without healing at the right times or places. You can do 100k damage and it's all to shields or aoe without doing much. People sometimes don't remember that the objective of the game is the objective and they get lost in solo gameplay instead of team gameplay.  There is a meta, and there are right ways to play the game, but it's varied unless you're at the very top 1% of the playing field. 

There certainly is a lot of fun to be had in Paladins, but it's not in solo queue very often. Just play some games, find someone who plays as a teammate, makes friends and queue together. Trust me, you'll have a lot more fun with just one other person willing to play as a team. You can carry teams much easier as a duo or trio than you could as a solo player. 

If you're into ranking, the ranked system is okay, you'll get bogged down in certain brackets but don't be discouraged. Just keep plugging at it and again bring a friend if you can. Please make sure you have several different types of each champion that you've played and unlocked all their legendary abilities for. There is a banning system and your team will expect you fill whatever position is open. Generally at first you'll be choosing last, so be ready to play any role with at least 2 champions in that role. Meaning Frontline (tank), Support (heals), Damage (main dps) or flank (priority target hunting).

Don't worry too much about unlocking things, as you play the game you'll get more and more stuff. If you're not good with certain champions, don't get discouraged, there are some that are difficult to play and some that are easier. There are also a couple not so good champions, but check the patch updates as often they balance these out. 

Play what you enjoy, don't worry about others telling you that champion X or Y are garbage. It may be that they are not the best, but all of them can be played and you can still win games with them. There is a mentality that if you're not playing the absolute best everything in the meta, then you're trash. Don't listen to that unless you're pushing for high ranks. You still should choose a role that best for your team comp, but pick any champion you enjoy in that role. You'll find out what champions are good together and the synergies as you play the game.

The game can be very buggy and that can be frustrating, so keep an eye out for the plethora of bugs.

All that being said, I love Paladins. I find myself enjoying it more and more. It frustrates the crap out of me, but I really enjoy the core gameplay loop. All those tragic bad moments where your teammates are throwing the game feel bad, but then when you win that 3/3 point by placing an ult at just the right time or dodging one or just making a really good play as a team, it feels all the better. Don't take this game too seriously and just have some fun."
29121,"Nice, nice"
29122,"Poor mans Overwatch.. joking.
In its own right this is a really fun game, it can be very competitive in high elo but it can also be really fun and relaxed in low elo both casual & comp. Definitely worth playing since the game is free and its not difficult to unlock all the champions it only takes time. Brilliant fun, definitely would recommend checking this game out!"
29123,"is great fun

29126,good game
29127,"Its a good game and its really funny to play. The community is also very big. I still think they need to nerf some champions and balance some stuff better, but further-a-do its a very good and nice game with amazing graphics and it still gets many updates and the creators listen good to the players."

29136,"Paladins has been an off and on game for me for a long time because I played Overwatch like crazy. One thing that comes as a real surprise to me is that I like this game a lot better if I'm being honest. There's so much more variety in the heros and there's a sense of progression by unlocking new champions as you go by playing the game. It's a ton of fun and always worth a shot if you're willing to give it one. And to be honest, it's free so why wouldn't you?"
29137,Fun

29163,iz okay
29164,the game has many flaws. currently (7/10/2020) the NA servers are unplayable and freeze or crash the game around halfway through. The devs clearly prioritize skins over making their otherwise great game playable
29165,fun
29166,"me like it
"
29167,
29168,Fun casual game and some may find it competitive but if you are a person that buys skins you will have to punch quite a whole in your wallet. Paladins is very fun to mess around with in a discord call with friends but Hi-Rez is more focused on releasing new characters rather than balancing the ones they already have.

29175,"This game is dead.

I spent a lot of money to support developer in and get items that I really like. I spent a lot of time on it.

For now, game is full with bots that makes game simply unplayable.

At the moment I played about 10 games per day during 2 weeks. About 80% of games there's a bot on my side or sometimes at enemy side. I have no idea why they ruined matchmaking THAT match. I haven't more power to continue playing this simply because I lost about 15 games in a row by having bot in my team or leaver that's replaced by bot.

Don't waste your time and play something different, developers just doesn't care about this game anymore."
29176,good game bad teams
29177,this is a funny overwatch wanna be
29178,a free p2w game to waste time on
29179,"@HiRezRomanova When you block anyone who shows disagreement with you be it rude or formal, it isn't a good look for you. This is the second time you did this and apparently numbers scare you and for some reason you can't outright give the numbers to your player base because ""reasons"" but I can. Really strange considering you are the person who is supposed to maintain transparency and be a bridge between the community and the people up top.

But we don't get that, do we? No, instead we get ""everything is fine, don't worry"" or ""that person is a troll, pay no attention to the numbers behind the curtain"" and lets not forget how we're all so ""negative"". Well of course we're negative. Why wouldn't we be? In the past seven months you people have collectively done nothing but shit the bed non stop. Boring Battle Passes, Skins as content when people have been begging you for new maps and game play modes for years, Servers more broken than they ever have been before, one feature being removed after another because your dev team is so incompetent compared to the last that it's far easier for them to remove things than fix them.

Then there are the blatant white lies. Oh, we fixed the servers! No you didn't, they're just as broken as before and no wonder there is slightly less server lag too. If I kicked over 10,000 people out of a bar I would wager to say it would be easier to get a drink too. Nice PR stunt by the way. Was it worth alienating tens of thousands of your paying customers just for a public event that would go stale in two weeks? The least you could have done was make a formal warning, but hey. Only the smartest ideas from Evil Mojo. I hope it was worth it. I'm so glad you guys removed third person and play of the game, it got rid of so many bugs. Said no one ever. Hey, remember that time you guys told us that restoring the old VGS was ""virtually impossible""? Yeah, this is why we don't trust you. Because you lie to us.

The game is the most unbalanced it has been since Dredge on release and I say that with certainty because I have been playing since the Dark Tides event. Why is Kevin even the person in charge of balancing the game? By the guy's own stats, he barely plays. All he does is pander to the AoC who does nothing but cry about champions they can't kill. Great, apply Cauterize to Luna. Way to confuse the entire community over what certain items even do. I mean if only there was an item in the cheapest bracket that would pretty much terminate the doggo on the spot with instant gratification instead of hoping the Support doesn't heal it. Oh wait! That item does exist. It's called Bulldozer. It even specifies that it is effective on PETS. Are the AoC reading impaired too? Because it sounds like it. The fact that you lend these people an ear over your community is a joke.

You hire an artistically incompetent man child who spends more time tracing over Realm Royale assets than actually drawing his own work and when he does it looks like an alien mashed genitals with a Clay Fighter and his art is the result. Saying his time is crunched isn't an excuse. In any other job that ""excuse"" would get you fired because you're not keeping up with your work. But hey, the guy needs to sit around and play DOOM Eternal and brain storm what fetish he wants to inject into the game next.

I can't really say much about Xienen. Not because he's a stand up guy, but because I'm not sure he even factually exists. Isn't this the person who's supposed to be running the show right now? Where is he?

People are tired of the lies, they're tired of the double standards that you show towards all your ""good boys"" when you punish others for exactly the same.

They're tired of you all playing dumb. How many times do you guys have to be caught stalking other forums and imageboards (you know which ones) just to try and start drama like you planting an avatar there acting like THEY made it to make fun of you or ThunderBrush roaming around 4chan of all places talking about bullying? And you call everyone else stalkers but can never confront your critics to their face because apparently that results in blocking and muting. What a joke.

They're tired of the lack of actual support. You'll ban over 10k players for an unspecified no no word but you won't look into actual hackers and toxic players who file false ban reports. Great job making the community a cleaner less toxic place by ignoring the actual toxic players. None of the cheaters and actual stalkers I have reported have ever had action taken against them and the person I haven been sending tickets about to get them unbanned because they were WRONGLY banned over a false flag report still remains banned. Good job. These actions speak volumes to me about where your real priorities are and it's not in what you say it is.

People are tired of the pandering. You want to stretch your horizons and seek out new demographics? Fine. But don't do it at the expense of your own player base. You claim to keep things neutral for everyone but that's the furthest thing from the truth. Everyone is tired of the social grand standing, you people have some of the most toxic people in your ranks. ChivaUK would still be an AoC if Syberbolt didn't call your bluff and blow the lid off that and something tells me you didn't really care in the first place and all you were worried about was saving face. If you actually cared, @DaddyMousePalas the Pedo mouse would be kicked out of the game yet here he is, still creeping on children. Fact is simple, you don't care. Oh, Black lives matter, gay lives matter, LGBT lives matter, every life matters but apparently not children's lives.

People are tired of the match making. I haven't ever seen a game with such broken match making before. A game should not punish you for doing well. It should put you in a bracket with other players who do well not the exact opposite. It's broken beyond words and I'm pretty sure you don't know how to fix that either.

People are tired of you unprofessional children acting like twats on every social platform. Holy shit, have some tact and act your age. Have you ever heard of a person who needed to take a break from their job talking to people because talking to people was ""too stressful"" but they still talk to people on the same platform? I haven't. And I probably haven't because you're all a bunch of thin skinned overgrown children and real jobs don't work like that. I share lots of people's sentiments when I say I hope this whole escapade makes you people poison to any other company you try to join and you are all unemployable. It happened after OB64, it's going to happen again. Who's heads do you think are going to be on the sacrificial chopping block this time. Think it over.

And most of all people are tired of the borderline unplayable game with more bugs than a crack house. I encounter at least a couple dozen in a single session. It's like a game and I don't mean the game I'm trying to play. It's like I'm a Dot Hacker or something and the mission is finding anomalies in the game. The only problem is you can never get away from them. I mean for goodness sake, there is a guy out that who has practically made a multi series video archive of all the embarrassing things that goes on in your game and community. You would think that would be your wake up call but I guess not.

I'm really tired of this game. Not so much of the community, but the people who fail to maintain it. I'm glad I didn't ever put a lot of money into it because after all this, I'm out. I'm not coming back either. I am deleting all my accounts related to Hi-rez and this game. I never want to touch another game related to you idiots again. I have played this game out for years and it has not yielded any fun reward in it. There are far better games out there that do the same thing so I will just go to them. Much like the others I'm heading to greener not bug ridden pastures.."

29186,"[h1] Review [/h1]
Paladins is an exciting, action-packed rip-off of Overwatch. While the two games are incredibly similar, Paladins being free possibly gives it the edge over Overwatch, seeing as both games have large active playerbases and compelling team-oriented gameplay.

[h1] Pros [/h1]
+ casual and easy to learn
+ relatively well-optimised so runs smoothly
+ not many cheaters

[h1] Cons [/h1]
- very difficult to re-learn after leaving for a while because they are always adding new stuff
- some characters are unbalanced

[h1] SCORE: 6.5/10 [/h1]"

29199,"Been playing this game for years on console and finally switched to PC. Honestly, there have been a lot of ups and downs of this game but, at the end of the day I still enjoy playing it."
29200,"if you play ranked and your team lose they blames it on someone and tells everyone to report you i got a 24hr ban bc of it i telling who ever sees this dont play this game!!!!
"
29201,"Lets be honest, I only wrote this review to gain awards. (wanna buy 
frame avatar) <3
Давайте будем честными, я написал этот обзор, чтобы получить награды. (хочу купить рамку аватара) <3"
29202,"If you're new to the game, I would recommend staying away from the game. Otherwise from someone who has lots of excessive amounts of hours into the game, after hitting GM in the game, you basically have ""completed"" the game, and the rest of the game is just mindless grinding for the battle pass/event pass. Yeah, levelling your characters are cool, levelling up your account is awesome too. Once you hit level 50 with a character, there's little to no reason to keep playing them afterwards. Hopefully the game can make new content to enjoy it much more - like how they did events (Siege of Ascension Peak, or even Rise of Furia) and made the content much better.

Edit: Posting this as I have added a lil over 1100 hours from the last time I posted this - and my opinion still stands."

29210,fun
29211,better than overwatch...
29212,Its a pretty good game
29213,"Its fun, but buggy as hell. And my god its... eh... a bit rough around the edges in therms of graphics. BUT... It's free, so I guess it's your typical double BUT situation."
29214,very fun
29215,"Very long queue times and ultimately short amount of gameplay. More time is spent waiting for a match to start than actually playing. I have 60 hours of play, probably around 20 of those hours I've spent waiting.

There are severe balance issues. Progress is incredibly slow, and buying a new 'champion' takes A LOT of time because end-of-match awards are pathetically small.

Not only that, but the DLCs come to a full price of over $120, and thats just egregious for a low-quality free to play game.

Good for wasting time, but not recommended for any long-term enjoyment."
29216,This Game Is SOOOO Fun
29217,"Paladins is one of the buggiest games that I have every played. And with each patch, the bugs and server issues seem to get worse and worse. Don't waste your time and money on this game."
29218,VERY GOOD GAME!
29219,YARE YARE..
29220,"I liked the gameplay and enjoyed that I can play with my friends on PS4. If you're struggling to find a game that's cross play for you and your friends, Paladins is not only free, but also cross play."
29221,I hate this game
29222,"Fun and smooth gameplay, a great alternative to Overwatch.  If you try it and like it, I recommend paying the $14.99 for the Battle Pass to unlock all the champions and get rewards as you level up.  Anything after that is cosmetic."
29223,"Pretty fun game. Similar to Overwatch, but it has a lot of good features that make it unique and worth playing."
29224,"I have been playing paladins since the release but stopped just right after OB64. I picked it up again when the digitized battle pass came out and went off for another year. Now the Radiant Stars battle pass is coming soon and I can say that I am very excited it. I really do like playing paladins but sometimes it can be stale because of all the bugs and hackers (I'm looking at you reticle color changing aimbots). Overall, no matter how much I leave the game and pick it up again it is still very much enjoyable."
29225,"I have to say althought you get to play the same maps over and over again you never get tired of it because of all the possible team combinations and strategies as well as the satisfaction of finally unlocking a skin or a champion you wanted, levels, battlepass quests and rewards. Ranked is fun to play, sometimes less competitive than casual matches, but the meta changes constantly and it's fun to try all the best comps. 1000 hours aren't enough to fully understand this game..."
29226,very good game. I enjoy playing
29227,"good game,good to pass the time and yea"

29229,bugs

29231,great
29232,cool
29233,It's fun leave me alone steam
29234,"If you haven’t rolled hundreds of hours in TF2 or clamped some money on Overwatch, then the game will be like a breath of fresh air.
Paladins are not demanding on iron. In addition to the game settings, the grafonchik is perfectly adjusted in ini-files.
There are not many heroes, in addition, they are divided into popular and not. A typical soldier from shooters, an archer (s), a sniper camper and an invisible killer are the backbone of 80% of all matches.
The maximum expectation of the match is 2 minutes, which is very pleasing.
Up to level 5 you will have to fight against bots, then already with real people. Here you can see who dodged in CS and who did not.
As elsewhere, nobody really wants to take on the role of a tank or a healer. Often a team is recruited from damage characters.
We spend money from frags on cards that add us bonuses of damage, defense, running speed, etc., but do not change the balance of teams much. There is no such thing as in MOVA - whoever quickly stocked up, he bends down.
There are ordinary skins (for gold), which differ only in color, there are rare (for rubles), but these are few and fig. With the skins here, the trouble is generally, it's not Heroes of the Storm.
There is no incentive in the game to strive for something. If you wish, you will buy all the heroes in 3-5 days, choose your favorites for yourself, buy cards for them, a total week and ... everything

29250,"very nice game, my nephew`s and niece`s love this game... <3"
29251,"I feel the meta is in a better place now, the bugs are less noticeable and the game feels significantly more balanced. I can fully recommend this game if you're up to try it. A quick warning though, new champions are a grind to get so be prepared for that."
29252,"game is shit. i can't stop playing. don't become like me. it crashes, theres soda can hit boxes, so even if you don't hit, there's a chance you actually did. balance is almost non existant, they keep doing things the players don't want them to do, like screw around with how we communicate in game. (Bring back nice job! or at least nice! and please, it doesn't kill anyone to be a bit polite.) skins are way over priced and you rarely end up getting what you want. 8/10 times I open a box, it's for a champ that I don't play. and lets not talk about the random conection issues the game has. It seems that a lot of people region hop for this game and that brings down the experince for the people in that region."
29253,"Paladins is a great game, dont get me wrong. i enjoy every game ive played, in terms of gameplay.

however, team mates are useless. almost never communicate. if they do, its just to be toxic and complain. new people have to deal with shitty people getting mad."
29254,It's fun
29255,"Its a great free game, really recommend it if you want to have quick battle with so many champions to play as."

29257,5/10 HONEST REVIEW
29258,good.
29259,Free overwatch
29260,"EDIT: I've changed my rating to ""Not Recommended"". While there is nothing being done about in-game racism and other forms of bullying (which is only getting worse) I cannot recommend the game.
___

The 400 hours are for *this* Steam account alone. I often have to switch between Steam and Epic for PC because of bugs that occur with the server and bugs recognising controllers. I've had several Hi-Rez accounts, previously used the standalone launcher, played every console version of the game. My time combined exceeds 5,000 hours (around a thousand for each year I've been playing).

After all that time on the game over several years, accounts & platforms - what I can say is the game at it's core is wonderful and still has huge potential to be something amazing.

If you don't take the game too seriously, you will have a lot of fun. Which is what is important.

The ranked mode clearly and badly needs an absolute overhaul, which unfortunately hasn't happened for this year's (2022/Season 5) ranked season. But they have at least tried to fix the matchmaking system, so there's that. But if I were a brand new player, I'd leave cross-play enabled and enjoy ""Quick Play"" for what it is. That's likely going to be your best bet for enjoying your Paladins experience (especially if you have some friendos you can play with).

I'm not going to go over all the pros and cons, I think those have been exhausted in other reviews. But I will say Paladins has the upper hand compared to it's peers in terms of customisation and play style.

I've seen people say the devs don't care, I think this is unfair. I believe the developers who are actually making the game, do care. But there seems to be a revolving door at Hi-Rez studios which is where a lot of the game's problems come from. Code being left unfinished by devs who worked on the game 6+ years ago makes it very hard to untangle bugs. Sometimes ideas/features are inconsistent because of the revolving door. Those things are forgivable (to me) you can't expect new people working on the game to have all the knowledge of the previous developers.

What really lets the game down is the report system/customer support. The game has an in built report system, which is abused by people reporting someone for playing ""poorly"" (i.e. not how they would play) or not utilising the in-match item store well (there is no in-game explanation for this). Therefore when something more serious happens, the reports on it are buried and the offending players are left to run rampant (despite what the community manager touts on Twitter, there is no in-game swift action against these offenders).

In terms of customer support, I've had support tickets go unanswered since 2019 about real world currency going missing, racial abuse & in game threats of physical harm.

So while the majority of the community are actually quite lovely, if you come across someone stepping over the line in terms of toxicity don't rely purely on Hi-Rez to sort it. Report it to the platform the person is playing on (you can usually find this out from a third party stat site).

Obviously take caution when spending any real money in game too, as this is unusually non-refundable and there are several bugs affecting crystals and skins.

Fun game, decent devs, lousy customer support."
29261,not great
29262,lol
29263,"free overwatch, nothing else to say"
29264,Best game ever
29265,"it just vibes and fun with homies
"
29266,Yes. I recommend.
29267,"Its Realy Fun
"
29268,well i guess this is fun for me when i play my internet is well
29269,"Big fan of overwatch and loved paladins. Played for almost 350 hours dealt with all the bugs the game is known for some big some small. With constant toxic players, the dcs the lack of support and how the strongest character in the game is broken because of how wonky the hit boxes are ""seriously strix can shoot 3 yds near almost any character"". But there is alot of good and unfortuanty a lot more bad. I Love how you can build a deck to suit a character for different situations. however, more needs to be done to help new players create a deck thats viable, maybe some tips or something to catergorize types of cards dmg/cd/health/mobility, idk something that would help the younger unexperenced people. Ranked is a joke and the game doesnt fit the competitive spectrum well. it does have more variety in characters than most games like this, and honestly truly great skins. Started fresh on a pc and after 340 hours got permabanned over some petty arguement with a premade of people who group reported m,e, first ban even and dealing with a bunch of trolls and get perma banned for returning trash talk. Game is semi fun overall if you enjoy just getting 20-30 kills each game, most people arent very good and its nice how if you want to learn someone new you can get xp vs bots in training, however they are very bad. its a pretty good looking game but the bugs arent worth dealing with if you dont have time or money invested, hi-rez kills games often and lets game breaking bugs exist for years sometimes. After coming back to overwatch i truly appreciate the small things and polish a large dev team can bring to the table."
29270,"Basically a pay to win overwatch copy, youre better off spending the 5 extra dollars on overwatch than spending 15 on this games characters which are carbon copies."
29271,yes
29272,no i would not recommend
29273,"Developers are like: Oh,a bug...let's add a new skin to barik"
29274,nice
29275,I poop alot
29276,They have made getting on to the game cumbersome.
29277,"Wow, I have never had to fight a game in order to play it. It won't let me sign into my account or make a new one  - I tried installing it through epic games and steam with the same issue. I tried to install, uninstall, and reinstall. I tried going into the properties and making changes based on others having this issue and I managed to [after several hours] figure out a way to get the login screen but even with the login screen it won't let me in. It appears that it needs to be updated as there is a warning sign however, when I had it on auto-update and I even went  into it and made Paladins priority but still it just would not update. I know this issue isn't just me as there are a ton of people online having the same issues. I played this on my steam awhile ago, the game was fun, and I didnt have this issue. All I can say is what the hell happened? I recommend you pass on this one - from what I am reading from others comments and my own experiences now - this game is not worth the hassle."
29278,very good fps game its good that you can buy new characters.

29303,Its a very good game for low to budget gaming PCs.
29304,"Game is ridiculously broken and unbalance since forever, may never be balanced at all. don't waste you precious time on this game, it's a literal joke."
29305,"very relaxing game to spend a lot of time on, simple in nature but also has a large skill cap and huge competitive scene."
29306,"This game is super fun. It is beautiful and very polished at this point. The roster is big and each game feels fun and fresh. My favorite game mode is siege because it provides multiple opportunities for each champion to shine. 

For the most part champions do feel unique. It does take time to learn who each champion is but the discovery is fun. New players wont have to pay too much attention to the tier list as familiarity with each champion and the roles they play is more important early. After that if you want to remain casual then just chose your favorite mode and play :-) If you want to get competitive then party up with your friends and research champion builds. This game really does scratch the itch for competitive and casual arena shooter fans.

Please give this game a shot. You wont regret it."
29307,recomended game
29308,...
29309,Fun game to play with friends

29317,"Sep 30, 2021:

The balance issues are fluid and improving steadily, though new ones are introduced at regular intervals. Overall the game is fun to play, except when there's some ridiculously OP oversight or exploit that every loser with a self-esteem problem will take advantage of until it gets fixed. Which sometimes is literally months. My biggest complaint about the game however, is in how they've fucked up the Battle Pass/Event system with this most recent incarnation. While you can still earn back the crystals you spent on the pass, it's now about 5x more difficult/annoying. To earn all the crystals back before, you had to reach level 120 of the pass, which took a significant amount of play time, even with boosters, but, if you kept up with it, playing regularly, since the passes were 90 days, you had to maintain an average of 1.33 levels per day. This wasn't always feasible if you had any semblance of a social life, a job, or wanted to play something else, or whatever. But I was cool with that. Now, the majority of the crystals have been moved to the ""achievements"" in the Trials of the Realms or whatever it's called. Which uses pretty much the same tasks that used to award 150,000 Battle Pass XP each, but divides them up in groups of 5, with 3 more groups being unlocked each week. But to make matters worse, of the ""unlocked"" groups, you can only have 2 groups of 5 active at any given time, and once activated, you're locked into that one until you finish it. Even though you can see what the reward is for each group, even if you went through and did every crystal one as soon as it became available, it's an inconvenient, annoying, boring, and unsatisfying undertaking. Most of the tasks are either so trivial, they literally take no more effort than playing a specific champion 5 times. The problem is that it's going to take you a minimum of 5 games to complete. Others require particular Talents for a particular Champion. More often than not, it's one of the worst, most useless talents they have. And then, there are the most interesting ones, and only ones that are actually satisfying to complete, but are less about skill and more about luck, or at least chance. These are the ones that require you to do 150,000 Damage, Shielding, or Healing in a single match. The majority of matches end before you've reached that mark. Some right before reaching it. They often force you to play champions you aren't good at, with Talents that handicap you, and provide no real element of fun, which all generally culminates in you losing the match. Especially when others on your team are also grinding. I never even bothered with going out of my way to do them when they were optional bonus XP, because the amount of matches it caused me to lose attempting them, was actually totalling to more XP than they gave. So I only did the ones that I just happened to do while playing, or that were within my wheelhouse. Even still, all of this could be forgiven if not for the tedious way they've limited you, making it difficult to kill 2 birds with 1 stone as you used to could accomplish several objectives in a single match. But the system of getting 15 each week of the pass and only being able to work on 10 at a time, drags out the monotony and tedium to the point that I'd rather do without the Battle Pass altogether than to have to do.

Worse still, is that instead of getting 4 new skins and 4 recolors with the Battle Pass, you now get 2 of each. The other 2 skins and 2 recolors become available from chests. That cost more crystals. For a RANDOM CHANCE of getting them.

Until this is fixed, my review will remain negative.
______________________________________________________________

Aug 10, 2021:

I started playing during beta, right around the time Sha Lin was added to the game. Since then I've watched it take 1 step forward and 3 steps backward with nearly every update. The first real WTF? was introducing Moji to the game. The only champion to have a constant attack with no cooldown or reloading necessary. Oh, and that's just the left-click, right-click is a burst with a short delay between shots, and also no cooldown/reload. And both can be held down constantly with no real drawbacks. This finally got tweaked (only slightly) in a much later patch, but, by then, far worse had gotten shoehorned into the game.

We'll skip past all the dumb nerfs, flip-flopping on ideas, and terrible trends, like how every Front Line after Khan has a shield unaffected by Wrecker. Or how a Jenos with Power Cosmeum can literally render pretty much any champion on the other team useless for most of the match. They added some 4-year-old's idea in the form of a worm that has crazy high defense, can move faster than champions on their mounts, is immune to ALL knockback effects, and whose primary attack also leaves spam all over the ground that acts as a DoT to anyone standing in it. Meanwhile, they've left glaring balance issues unresolved for months.

One redeeming quality of the game was that you could earn crystals (the primary currency in-game,) albeit not a lot. They introduced unique events that were fun, only to end them despite their popularity. They replaced them with a Battle Pass like so many other cash-grab games. But, to their credit, each Battle Pass cost 600 crystals and, IF you completed the entire Battle Pass, you could actually earn 600 crystals back. Meaning, if you worked hard, you could take part in every Battle Pass for free, but sacrificing the ability to spend the crystals you earned on unique cosmetics, chests, etc. Now, they've completely changed the format, making the bulk of crystals come from boring chore-like ""achievements"" that either make you play a champion you don't want to play, or accomplish something that's only half skill and the other half luck, like dealing 150,000 damage in a single match, healing 150,000 in a single match, and shielding 150,000 in a single match. Most matches ending long before you can possibly get to that point. And, while these tedious ""achievements"" could just be done before, you now have to unlock locations on a map to even be able to fulfill them. You can unlock 2 locations at a time with 5 tasks per location. So you can only work on 10 at any given time, which is a pain in the ass, because later tasks have some overlap with earlier ones, where you could've killed 2 birds with 1 stone. They've also reduced the number of skins you get with each Pass from 4 + 4 re-colors, to 2 + 2 re-colors with 2 more and their re-colors purchasable in chests.

Finally, they had added Bounty Points, which you earned from doing your 3 daily quests and could use to buy whichever skin was currently available in the store tab. You could also go to the Bounty Store Market and sell ones you didn't want to other players for Bounty Points or buy a skin from another player. Now, pretty much all of that has been removed in lieu of a few arbitrary skins they offer, 1 of which can ONLY be purchased if you purchased the current Battle Pass. And Bounty Points can no longer be earned from quests, or in game AT ALL. You have to go watch Twitch streamers for 4hr blocks in exchange for ""drops.""

All of this garbage development combined with the fact that they removed one of the most satisfying mechanics in the game (The Top Play, which would show a replay of one of the best play of the match, measured by number of enemies killed within a few seconds,) and I've lost nearly everything I once loved about this game. It was such a great feeling to have a killer play getting a Penta and knowing everyone was gonna have to see it replayed after the match was over. Now, you just join a game and hope some sackless simp doesn't choose one of the OP champions and ruin the match. I used to highly recommend this game, but now, I urge you to steer clear. It's become as hollow and unsatisfying as the myriad others like it."
29318,i love this game but thay should chang here name to bugladins
29319,"Good game better than overwatch lmao

29332,Awesome game if you want to play a blizzard game for free! In all seriousness though this game is a lot if fun
29333,"This game is really awesome and enjoyable to play for free! Also, I love the fact that you create your own loadouts for each champions you choose and then you can select the loadout that is suitable for the match. I do hate that there are not many maps for TDM or onslaughts. Sometimes I get bored because it's the same map almost every time. Also, I like that is not necessary for you to buy skins because it won't affect your game play, I do agree they looks really cool."
29334,"The game is very open to new champions and keeps most them well balanced. There are a few flaws such as overpowered characters and unbalanced matchmaking, but it's a fairly great game I would suggest my friends and others to try out."
29335,"Overwatch but with different champions and more broken.

Enjoyed it a lot."
29336,"Paladins is the fastest I have ever got over 50 hours on a game

For a free to play title I think that this game handles its model very well, paying for cosmetics and the ability to have every character in the game is not too bad in my opinion but I do have a few issues with the game that I do want to talk about. 
The time that it takes to earn enough coins to buy a new legend is high and it does take a while to earn enough to actually but a new character. The only time that it feels like you get coins at a decent rate is when there is a double coin/XP weekend but when that isnt the case I feel that trying to get all of the characters without having to pay for them is going to take a while and for me, it does seem like there isnt enough characters on each weekly rotation (You do get quite a few characters by default for free without the rotation characters but i just thought I would point it out.)

Honestly if you want a game that you will enjoy playing for a while and you don't want to spend money, get this game. There is legit nothing to lose, the game is free and I think that you would get a good amount of fun out of this game."
29337,NONONO YESSSS
29338,idk
29339,good game
29340,Good game
29341,vry dun
29342,"For people who enjoy Overwatch will also enjoy this game, having played both of them here are some features done better in paladins:
-you can customise your character and gun (from different sets) 
-a nice voice system to be able to say the enemy is behind 
-you can choose which game modes you wish to play
-a better HUD so you can see who has Ult coming up without having to ""TAB""
- a better cluster of play styles ( most champs have a common link with a gun e.g smg, assaut rifile etc.
- better explanation of what the weapons do ( paladins actually gives dmg/sec , range etc)
-being able to ban champions in competitive
Overwatch of course is both graphically smoother and plays better but this free to play game is worth playing at least once as it has its own uniqueness and by no way feels like a straight clone and above all else it is alot of fun!
"
29343,Very fun to play with friends. All Characters have a weakness You just need skill. to defeat them pretty balanced honestly.
29344,"The game is not bad its fun with interesting characters. but i feel like im in hell everytime i play i am playing with noobs or people who are just jerking it in a corner. some people are good ""spot on"" but thats 1:100 people youll play with, you should friend them. all the other people are... idk what they are doing, probs drooling on their pc idk. i know that we were all noobs at one point but my god every single fing time i play im babysitting with my healer. so if your ok with that everything else is good"
29345,The game is easy to get into with play mechanics that you can develop into after a short playthrough. Lots of options and customizations although there is a a ton of purchasing that can be done in the game. Overall fun and fast play with some nice detail in the game.
29346,it's good
29347,"Amazing free to play game, quick games, none of this dragged out 30 min games. Doesn't get much easier than this."
29348,its ok ig
29349,For me Paladins is a easy going cartoonish game which uses good flow of gameplay with classes that suite the objectives the leveling system isn't all that rewarding you make more coins from quest than you do from leveling but there it keeps you busy getting that next skin or character. I play paladins to relax after other games get me mad! it doesn't feel serious and the toxic players are not many! the biggest problem I have is the queue times though but that is probably due to a lack of players hence why this game needs more community support
29350,fun game very interesting and competetive
29351,"Overwatch clone goes:

Please wait while copying game files to new directory..."
29352,it constantly says that it needs to update but idk how so i cant play it

but with these things being in the game i still think paladins is a great game if they take the time to polish the game
its really enjoyable with friends or maybe even solo and the strats you can do is amazing when you pull it off

29405,great game! i am not very fluent in game knowledge but i love playing this and have only recently installed it. the only issue i have is that coins are very hard to come by and the game can lag alot from time to time but that isnt the games fault i suppose.
29406,"i really like it 
"
29407,Still Love This game and its halfway through 2020. Overwatch suuuuuucks....
29408,noice
29409,grind
29410,Overwatch lite
29411,its a better version of smite and such  a good time waster
29412,Trash matchmaking
29413,Pas pire
29414,Great game Ive been playing games like this since 2014 with overwatch and this is similar but isnt a copy 100% 10/10 recommend
29415,ffff
29416,I like it.............That's it
29417,It is a good game got a large amount of characters to pick
29418,meh
29419,..
29420,"This game isn't perfect and it is basically begging you for money every time you open the game, but behind all that is a roster of pretty interesting characters. And I'm pretty happy with the amount of gold they give me to unlock characters compared to other games."
29421,yes very good
29422,This fun. I r heal noobs.
29423,"overwatch, but the free one, but with locked heroes/champs"
29424,its a great game
29425,Is good :3
29426,this game is so engaging and fun andd everyone should play
29427,yes
29428,good game
29429,best game
29430,"I've played alot of this game and generally its really fun, however I lost my account and its an absolute pain to try and get it back"
29431,cool game
29432,"comp match lost cuz it crashed nine times in a row... good job, evil mojo!"
29433,"So..... where do we even start here... ah I know lets start with the positive sides of the game.. ahm so the game is fun to play and the champions arealso extremely balanced compared to other games. Also the community of this game is not as toxic as others r and the game is also competitivly in a good state. But... Evil Mojo does not well sadly.. cause every Skin they bring out is either in a limited time event or the Battle pass and if u mess up to get this skins at this time u'll never be able to get them again and this feels just so bad that they want u to purchase this at all costs in order to get them. And rather than fixing their game bugs htey decide to use their patches to bring out skin after skin so u r damned to buy this if u want it... Another bad thing they have is that some champs cant do anything against specific other champs which leads to that people get flamed cause the utility isn't  there because they have a hard time doing well and this is also a reason why they need to focus less on their skins... But overall its fun to play so if u just look for fun u'll have a good time with ur friends in normal games, and u can even play maps which arent finished yet, which is a nice feature to have in such a game"
29434,GREAT GAME REALLY FUN 2 PLAY
29435,"azsxdcfnjmkolerlp[;rtufythjikolp, gooooooood!

29436,"Great game for free, whats not to like"
29437,amazing
29438,bro i did not put 40 hours into this trash thanks steam
29439,ayyyy thats pretty good
29440,If you are fine with some hilarious yet frustrating bugs which have become more like in-game features by now its a pretty fun to play casual game.
29441,i like it
29442,Un joc okappa
29443,"Bro, I LOVE THIS GAME!"
29444,"Paladins was a really promising game at the beginning but over the years they have added numerous champions and everything has gone very unbalanced. Of course as in any game that presents the ranked there will be together with them a truly toxic community, for paladins you will meet it especially with a gold and platinum rank.
It is still a fun game to play in company but I do not think it is the most suitable for competitive play especially if you are alone or in 2."
29445,a really enjoy this game but i cant buy the battlepass but its the best game ever
29446,Wtf you did with this game ?
29447,"The game is very good, I like it.

Edit - I lied, DO NOT PLAY IT... if you do not want to mald over some broken champ insta killing you through whole map."
29448,hay
29449,nice
29450,"GOOOOOD
"
29451,Good game still updating!
29452,"Words can't describe how terribly balanced this game is. From the characters and their terrible abilities, the capsule hitboxes 3 times the size of the character models, the fact that inputs occasionally don't go through (and no, it's not my equipment, because it doesn't happen in any other games), the terribly lazy development choices, the awful matchmaking, everything. Literally everything. It's a free game, and I still feel ripped off."
29453,good
29454,Better than overwatch. Still mediocre genre.
29455,made me nut
29456,"game is good but too many bugs
"
29457,"decent game

"
29458,this game hits
29459,"This is a good game, can be a bit overwhelming in the beginning as you will have to learn all of the characters but once you do, it will be easier. Its also relatively simple to pick up a character you havent played before and still have fun."
29460,"Okay game, never really got into it but it is for sure worth a try! Just know that this game heavily advertises cosmetics as this is a free game with lots of love put in."
29461,bad
29462,lol good game
29463,I thought it was overwatch but I was wrongggg....
29464,if you are looking for a great multiplayer game to play with up to 4 friends then this is it.
29465,this game is good but buggy as shit
29466,It wont even let you alt + f4. That's the kind of game it is.
29467,"If you are bored of Overwatch, It's definitely worth checking out!

Lots of heroes to try out - waifu and husbando material!
I like how you can customize your hero build to fit your playstyle!
Even if you die, it doesn't take long to get back from spawn into action thanks to mounts.
Performance is great!

Matchmaking is questionable at times.
While you don't have to fear the weeb blade Gengu in this game, there are also flankers
here like Maeve or Androxus for example that can dominate the match if the person is a god gamer.

Champions Pack unlocks every hero and future hero, highly recommended when it's on sale!"
29468,It's an overwatch rip off. Everyone knows that. But that does not stop it being fun.
29469,It's really bad
29470,"The game crashes and then they punish you for the crash by calling you a deserter.  They could easily fix this by allowing a reconnect during character selection but they haven't done that.  Also there are other crashes that make the game annoying.  I have a new computer that should have no problem running this simple game so there is no excuse. 

Update:  Now lagg is a huge issue.  Jumping becomes impossible and executing any sort of time sensitive fight will get all messed up.  
At least it is F2P"
29471,yes
29472,"I really like this game and after a long time playing it, I can say it was one of my best games of my childhood ;')"
29473,Yes
29474,good
29475,"is good very good
"
29476,Its a pretty neat game to play
29477,good
29478,Vey good game!
29479,"This game is so fun, it's easy to run, and simple to learn the mechanics. Therefore making a great game, and you don't need to spend any money to become a master. A certainly recommended game."
29480,cool
29481,"Surprisingly, gaining gold wasn't too hard. After playing for about 2 weeks I was able to gain about 130,000 gold. That's enough for 2-4 characters and that made me much happier than the multi-week grind for a few characters in league. The card system also allows for an impressive amount of customization, which is super fun."
29482, nice game
29483,"Please do more research about your champions abilities and nerf what's necessary.
Too many champions are just broken."

29485,Good game :)
29486,Fun game
29487,fun lamo
29488,Excellent!
29489,"best game on steam is paladins
"
29490,"Paladins has become my default go-to; it's highly addictive, and is one of the best ""free to play"" games available. The fact that you can build loadouts for characters, and purchase perks mid game allows for more diverse battles, more so than overwatch. Not to mention you spawn in on horseback, allowing you to quickly return to battle rather than walking. This game has grown much since it's initial release, and has surpassed it's reputation in my opinion. Also it's less toxic than original overwatch. 🎄"
29491,"SEA,JP server is UNPLAYABLE! it has been like this for few weeks. no update no information."
29492,love it
29493,I prefer this Paladins over Overwatch tbh. so yeah
29494,I would recommend to every to play this because this is the game which doesn't required high graphics card and game is so smooth. Quick game ending and matchmaking is fast too. Sometimes it takes time due to less players but when there is more players on that day then you don't have to wait.
29495,A very simple yet fun game to always return to.
29496,tHIS GAME fucking sucks
29497,if u cant afford overwatch then i guess this is playable
29498,this bitch fun
29499,trash game better spend 10 bucks to play overwatch than this shit
29500,Don't play this game
29501,It's a good game
29502,mantul
29503,is fun
29504,paladins is very well  balanced and the characters are fun to play and have very rich lore behind them making you get invested in all the characters and world and also the skins and designs of each character are sick and also everyone in this game is very nice and nobody is toxic

29509,"Its better than Overwatch, but not as good as tf2"
29510,it's not the best but it is worth your time
29511,"
A special shooter with tactical elements. If you get used to all the champions and select a part of them for yourself, you can win by training on who you liked. In the game itself there are heroes with unique abilities and a special attack, but there is a store the same for everyone, where for a reward inside the match you can get increases to one or another attribute (passive ability)."
29512,good game
29513,"plays like league of legends and copies champions from league of legends, but in a first person  view, so basically is a copy of overwatch, but with smaller maps and free to play, the way overwatch shoul've been since for ever."
29514,"I liked the game its good, but i saw a lot of bugs, if u are going to play this plz be prepared for bugs."
29515,Alright init
29516,Better than Overwatch
29517,"free overwatch, but gets kinda buggy if you have to many friends"
29518,The free overwatch is not even good. (well whats to expect)
29519,"Despite the game seeming relatively stable and, most of all, fun, you will find that playing Paladins is not an experience that can last very long.

It all probably has to do with the very beginning of its development: Paladins was doomed from the start. Bad decisions and negligence are present to this day, lying in the pile of spaghetti code that, although somewhat stabilized by latter patches, still manage to surface from time to time, giving you each time new wonders to behold in all kinds of visual and gameplay bugs and glitches. (It often occurs that, although patch notes say something was fixed, it obviously wasn't.)

It is all too bad, because the gameplay can be extremely fun at times, especially with friends (which is what kept me playing for so long), but ocasionally, the development team will attempt to ""experiment"" with objectively moronic and uncalled-for balance changes, only to remove them a patch later. (It really seems like they do this just to savor the tears of the playerbase.)

Despite you maybe giving it a chance to try it out, it is worth noting that the game itself might not give you a chance in return. Paladins' optimization is quite trash (spaghetti code, remember?) and a budget PC will certainly not be able to compensate for this lack of performance on part of the game. I don't care about Overwatch because i never got into it. However, many computers that can't run Paladins well can, actually, run Overwatch very well.

Worth mentioning: Hi-Rez is, generally, quite prone to failure, as a whole. When they launched the game on Epic Games, they screwed up their damn account data base, and now it's impossible for me to log in with my steam account. Yes, i had quite a few bucks worth of cosmetics in the game. The problem is, their customer support screwed me over, and answered my support ticket after 2 weeks (not kidding), only to literally give up on their customer later on. Now that's professionalism.

All in all, if you're looking to take it up: BE ADVISED! :)"
29520,Graphics and all around team play is amazing. Characters are nice and well thought of. Looking forward for more players to play for marchmaking is hard most of the times
29521,"I have played both paladins and overwatch, Mostly both on console. If I had to choose which one to exclusively play (Note I own overwatch on pc as well) I'd chose paladins. The game has many options for people to play and enjoy, as well as the random characters you are given at the start make the game fantastic to start with friends as you'll all have different characters available at the start to choose. I haven't played it long on pc but it still is a-lot better than overwatch and it's free."

29534,oke
29535,"I won't say this game is a knock off of overwatch, this game instead is inspired by overwatch. In paladins there is a lot of champions which you can unlock with either gold or diamonds, each one has special attacks. There is 3 modes in this game, deathmatch, siege and capture, deathmatch is well...your typical cod deathmatch, so it's a great mode for players who love killing enemies but doesn't want to capture anything, but it can get boring in a while, siege is capturing a point and after you capture the point, you need to move the payload, and the enemies will try to kill you to avoid moving the payload, you have to move the payload in 3 Minutes or you will lose, first team to get to 3 points wins, capture is capturing a point, but instead you have to capture it till you get it 400 points, just like your typical cod domination, but it's only 1 point.
This game's art style is pretty colorful and cartoon looking, it's a really great art style.
This game is optimized for low end hardware which is a great thing, I play this game at 768p max settings and it runs really well, this game is also optimized for slow internet (but not THAT slow).
Grinding for champions doesn't really take that long, ofc if you have money you can unlock the champion instantly, but champions doesn't a lot of gold so that's a big ups for people who don't to spend money on this game.
This game is really fun and matches can take a while, matchmaking can take a bit too long but the average for me is 1 minute, I say get this game, it's really great and it also has crossplay, so you can play with your friend on a different platform, and hey, it's free! So if you don't like it you can uninstall it  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Zero pay to win, very player-friendly all-characters-forever purchase.

However, werd-to-hostile monetization otherwise. Plenty of good cosemetics that I'd like to buy, but most of them show up in a battlepass and I don't play enough to get them, then they go into loot boxes which I will not buy.

Some skins are direct purchase and I'm glad to support the game through them, but am disappointed that I can't buy many others I like."

[Paladins is a game that once was a passion project that you can tell had a lot of love and effort poured into it, but sadly it doesn't seem that the developers care very much about the gameplay, bugs, glitches, or instability anymore. Rather, they prefer to constantly push out cosmetic events for some quick cash every 2-3 months instead of addressing the issues that have been plaguing the game for a year or more that the community have been consistently vocal in bringing to the devs attention. If you want to play a game by a company that pushes their project out of beta prematurely so that they can generate revenue from it being on console platforms; devs that celebrate the banning of hundreds of players that had no previous reports against them because they went through direct messages and deemed some players too inappropriate to play their game without a week-long timeout; a company that will ignore and block influential community creators that critique their bad creative and business practices; has had more than their fair share of shady, internal politics, then Paladins is the game for you.]

If you want to sink money into a game that only offers meaningless cosmetics and tragically inconsistent gameplay then install Paladins ASAP. If you want a multiplayer game that offers more than this, you should probably keep browsing.


(A small bit of info about me if you wish to have some perspective on where my review comes from.)
I started playing Paladins I believe in May 2017 while it was still well entrenched in beta, I saw the game go through crashes and resurrections of updates that would tank and then revive the player count, I stuck to a fairly consistent play style that allowed me to see the changes in the game around me more than I changed with the game. Sometimes patches were kind to me, sometimes they nerfed things I relied upon, but I only ever took one real break from Paladins for around 6 months and played consistently for the rest of the time. I bounced between this and Dead by Daylight which also went through some balance updates that would destroy and surge player counts, so I ping-ponged between the games when ""bad"" patches came through. The events that finally led me to permanently uninstall Paladins were several moves by Hi-Rez that just disrespected the small community that propped their game up, and I don't like supporting ingrates. I won't be installing Paladins again, and if you don't believe me, you can look at my Brawlhalla review for my track record."
29627,best game of all time cured my depression no longer want to kill myself thank you vandahar

29631,nice game i think
29632,"Decent FPS. Got a couple hours into this and have had fun so far. Its worth giving a look at. There is some issues with game play. The focus for the devs seems to be micro-transactions vs game play balances and bug fixes. 

It could be worse but could be a lot better."
29633,"Un insulto a los juegos multijugador. Consiste en 2 equipos cuyos personajes están todos completamente rotos, por lo cual no se requiere ningún tipo de habilidad para jugar y, cuando eso ocurre, la suerte pasa a tener un papel primordial, lo cual destruye el videojuego."

29646,This is a very fun game!
29647,THE GAME VERY MANTUL
29648,"Very fun and the new updates/characters makes it something to keep coming back to. This game is part of a very small genre of games, but is still one of the best. Very strategy orientated and partly skill based. Some things need balancing tho."
29649,nice game
29650,its a good game but it does got a couple of bugs in the game but if you want a hero shooter that you dont want to pay for this is a decent one to play its pretty noob friendly cant really say that for the players though
29651,free overwatch
29652,Free fun alternative to Overwatch.
29653,The elite version of Overwatch
29654,it wasted my life. recommended
29655,"heat af, bad team comp tho."
29656,"Awesome game, graphics are nice and there's a variety of fun characters to use."
29657,"i highly recommend this game this game is free and i have lots of fun playing it 
"
29658,"Re-submitting this since I've had more time to properly gather my thoughts on this.
This game really is a sad example of what happens when you try to jump on the bandwagon rather than coming up with your own ideas.

The characters, while often stealing their kits from other games (namely Overwatch and League of Legends) do have interesting designs but often don't get enough love from the devs to fully realize their full potential.  In addition, while the game tries to combine mechanics from both of the previously mentioned titles, it leans too heavily on their inspiration and ends up coming off as a cheep knockoff as a result.

I should have added this in when I first put out this review, but I was pressed for time at the time, but there is two more issues that desperately needs to be addressed.  The first is balance which is basically non-existent.  Several character (Dredge, Ash and Zin in particular) are able to dish out extreme amounts of damage, giving any team who has one of them a massive advantage and any team who all of them a surefire win).  This imbalance is a serious problem and one that needs to be worked out.

The second issue is the community. It is hands down one of the worst gaming communities I have ever been a part of, somehow managing to beat out both League of Legends and Overwatch in sheer toxicity.  A large portion of the community is made up of kids, griefers, cheaters, and throwers.  False reports are thrown out almost every game due to players not understanding how this genre of game works and the few truthful reports that are filed are constantly ignored by the moderation team (if there even is one)."
29659,really cool game
29660,200+ hours on xbox pretty good game
29661,guns go pew pew :] good game
29662,fun with friends
29663,"for people who are sick of overwatch or just want something a little greater in their gameplay, paladins fits that hole. It's not perfect and still has a long way to go but it gets the job done of being a good way to pass the time."
29664,meh
29665,great game. custom loadouts make it fun
29666,.

29668,"Paladins was a game I loved. Back in the good ol days of 2018 even 2019 it shined of potential. I got many of my friends into it and I made many more in it, I climbed the ranks and held top 100 on multiple accounts, but to what end? Paladins at it's core is not a good game, it is a game that shows a lot of potential, but all of that has pretty much withered away. HIREZ has turned paladins into a cow that is being milked at every opportunity: CHECK OUT THESE NEW SKINS, ARE THESE LEWD SKINS BUY OUR NEW BATTLEPASS TO FIND OUT. But what this used cow that is paladins need is bug fixes, balancing and server care. There has always been issues like these in paladins, but at this moment they are more profound than any other time, what HIREZ need to do is to take a copy from the books of ubisoft and have their own version of ""operation health"" and not add any new content but focus hard on repairing their game. But sadly HIREZ is a company that does not care about their games, only making money, on multiple occasions I have personally sent in reports of players staying afk in spawn flaming my team with video evidence, aswell as their match history where they obviously throw multiple games and what I get 2 weeks later is a respone that it will be looked into (sad to say but most of these players kept on playing daily, since I'm a pityfull person I checked). But from what I said it may sound like it is difficult to get people banned, lol nah fam all you need to do is to spam report someone, 20 reports in a week will get your account suspended. If you are a new player I would highly advice you to stay clear of Paladins, and to not listen to the people with 20 hours on the gaming ZOOMING going good game man. 

TL:DR 
HIREZ PEEPEEPOOPOO COMPANY, their game development team and support makes me want to bash my head in with a rock. Paladins is terrible game, and has always been. The potential is gone and all you are left with is jewish moneygrabbing company that milks it for the last drops.
DO NOT GET THIS GAME."
29669,the game is improving - Recomendend
29670,One of the best free games on steam. Packed full of badass heroes and guns. Cool abilities and easy to understand control. And on all of that some sick cosmetics. The only negative is the price of microtransactions but its understandable being a free game! 4.6/5!
29671,"Fun gameplay akin to CS:GO and other such shooters. 
Play this game if you like hero shooters that reward skill"
29672,good game
29673,"gotta be honest... no matter how much people say it's different, it's an overwatch clone to me."
29674,its a great game th at could be better
29675,its very fun
29676,What is this? Valorant Better
29677,ebay overwatch tho but i love this game
29678,"Lots of fun, just kinda buggy. Also, no one uses microphone at any level of play, get used to that."
29679,discount overwatch
29680,"have an easy learning curve but hard to be good at it, can sucks on the first 10 hr or so cause you need to learn about the game, but after that it's all great, especially if you're playing with a friend
"
29681,its free and fun so no complains here
29682,it is free overwatch i like it
29683,"It's only fitting that the most toxic community ever is the community for the least balanced and most buggy game ever. I'm not even sure I can call it a game. It's more like just some garbage freeware that installs extra crap on your system you don't need, such as the Anti Cheat software that doesn't catch any cheaters, and the data collecting software which sends all your data to a 3rd party (You have to agree to it in the terms and conditions otherwise it won't let you play).

I wholeheartedly encourage you to NEVER download freeware from these developers and publishers, and instead spend your time in a game that is closely cared for and taken seriously by it's developers, and has a community that isn't severely toxic."
29684,ok
29685,"very yes
"
29686,very nice game
29687,aha
29688,Extremely fun free to play game kinda like overwatch but easier to understand.
29689,"I bought Overwatch.
I know I have more than 500h but let me tell you, don't play this shit. It has an horrible community like really toxic, devs don't even know their own game name tbh, all they do is gamepasses. There are so many bugs and T-pose characters, it's not playable sometimes, makes me laugh but i wanna cry.

pls don't play for your own sanity, i've lost mine"
29690,"very fun, fast paced shooter. great for those who do not like games like COD or Battlefield."
29691,Very good game
29692,good
29693,"i only play overwatch because i don't have enough money for paladins. jk this game is absolute trash. the community is way way way worse than any competitive games out there hell almost the same level as league even tho paladins community is much smaller.

there is also copy paste character designs from overwatch tho many paladins argue that its a inspiration but there is a difference between inspiration and literally copy paste. inspiration are like dark souls inspired by the manga series berserk, stardew valley inspired by harvest moon.  

this game has so many character but still the maps is limited and looks and feel like shit. matchmaking is trash, every match you will always play with degenerate toxic 13 year olds every game. also the game skins and character designs feels like created by incels and made for incels."
29694,franc kangler likes
29695,game for spend time
29696,nice game
29697,"It's good competitive game, its like overwatch but paladins is harder cuz its not causual game, you need alot of time to be good player here espicaly in rank mode.
(not like every one thought)"
29698,:D
29699,"First of all, you should not compare this game to overwatch, the type of play, the flexebility and just core gameplay is so much diferent, it has its shares of things in common but thats bound to happen when theyre in the same genre.
It's fun and kind of ""easy"" to learn as it doesnt have manny difficult mechanics so just abillities and map knowledge.
Still think the beta was better when everything was OP but i respect the changes to even out some of the problems that existed."
29700,"honestly fun, none of my friends like it but i still have fun playing alone"
29701,Very good game! Like it a lot.
29702,"Its like a free Overwatch, but better :)"
29703,can get kinda boring but fun
29704,"Paladins is free to play and fun to play. But it's annoying to play it because of some bugs and unexpected lags during gameplay , which they never care about to fix. They introduces  BattlePass and Champion skins most of the time but hardly fixes the major bugs. If they do states that they fixes some bugs,believe me you would never heard of those bugs before and the major bugs will still be there to annoy you during game time. As for 30-06-2020, you can see champion Cassie with T-Pose during champion selection while all other selected champions are in their respective style/motion.

Still this is a great game. I like this game because it's fun, community is not toxic as dota2 and CS:GO. Players don't shout on voice chat like in other games they do. But Evil Mojo Games (Developers) are not properly taking care of the game and that's the only reason paladins losing it's players day by day.

If you are ok with some bugs and unexpected lags, they I will recommend you to give it a try. If not then plz don't play this one."
29705,yes boii~~~!
29706,"Good game but gosh it needs a better community, ranked is so trashed by toxic players and that shit makes me get out off that game for good. If you look for a competitive game, well look further, the game in itself is amazing i tell you but this comunity..."
29707,"good game
"
29708,I love playing this game with friends. The characters are well made and unique. And its free!
29709,"I was #1 on Xbox, now i'm #1 on PC."
29710,"Fun and easy to learn
"
29711,"controller imput, dogshit game"
29712,"Most fun I've had playing a hero shooter! Definitely not pay to win like a lot of free games nowadays. The rate at which you earn in-game currency is pretty balanced. Basically by the time I'm comfortable with one champion, I have enough to buy a new one. Constant updates seem to keep everything balanced and any bugs that emerge are often dealt with quickly. Also, with my combined playtime on my PS4 (where I first started playing since the games launch) I easily have 150+ hours."
29713,Great game
29714,This game is mega ass. That is all.
29715,"this game has more bugs than fallout 76, dear god I wish that was a joke
Trying to link my account was a process so tedious I wanted to nail my testicles to a board and go snowboarding. tfw you can't even make a clone game right. If you can handle the utter mess this game is then it's pretty fun I guess"
29716,zzZZZzZ Just play overwatch -_-
29717,"insane fucking insane mad right one time yh i got shot in the back by a fucking elf mad insane i cant believe it would 100
% play again but i got shot in the back by an elf now i cant move gn"
29718,game gud haha
29719,good
29720,its a great game to play
29721,It's pretty pleasant to play this game. I like to play it to chill
29722,its is a really fun and addictive game i enjoy it but it can barely run on my laptop or i would play more = )
29723,gg
29724,I LIKE
29725,"Awesome game, came from OW. Great diversity in champions."
29726,.
29727,
29728,Way better than Overwatch.
29729,10/10 sugar daddy bought me pretty things.
29730,"I liked to play this game with my friends in its early stages, but when I played recently, the whole skin craze was a turn-off for me..."
29731,I still see bugs/glitches that are over 2 years old. They keep adding skins and lootboxes instead of fixing their shit.
29732,"It's basically free overwatch with more characters, yeah its fun but some characters really need to get balanced.

Anyhow, I'd recommend playing with at least one friend as sometimes your other teammates can be a bit slow.

It's an okay game, not bad, not good. 5/10


Edit on the 2/1/2021:

Do not play this god awful game, the game isn't fun and bugs aren't being fixed. I have been stuck in the ''infinite loading into match'' glitch which ruins any enjoyment you may have. If you decide to play, at least drag one or two friends with you."
29733,"It´s a great game. At the beginning, the system might be a bit confusing but overall a wonderful game. I love it!"
29734,tf2 for babies
29735,nice
29736,I likey.
29737,"Overwatch, but Free to Play. I liked it"
29738,its good for just wanting to have fun
29739,"933 hours I've spent on this game, I enjoyed it up to 900hrs. The last 33 hrs have been me uninstalling and reinstalling the game back and forth with each new character release. Honestly after Corvus I felt a shift in Paladins and grew bitter to its repetitive game play. With all the champions unlocked, no skins worth buying, and most of my friends having stopped playing, it just felt empty. ALSO SOME OF THESE RECENT CHARACTERS ARE EITHER BUSTED OR BORING AF. With the constant addition of Weeabo and furry sh#t i'm just done. Thanks for entertaining me threw my high school years, wont forget that!"
29740,It's good if you don't have the money to buy Overwatch or if you wanna play with a friend on another platform
29741,it's fine
29742,i genuinely hate this game and you know what i hate even more? black people.
29743,good
29744,Very pog game
29745,"69 nice.
"
29746,its a better version of overwatch

29748,its very good
29749,".
"
29750,"Great Game.
most people say it's a Overwatch clone, in fact overwatch is a tf2 clone but low skill gap.
it's not trying to be overwatch, it's different.
+Item Mechanics
+Headshot Mechanics
+nice character design

overall fun to play with friends"
29751,best game
29752,best game
29753,"Paladins provides various characters, called Champions, for the players to choose during their gaming sessions. Each of these Champions falls into one of the following categories: Front Line, Damage, Support, and Flank. Being a team-based shooter, players must rely on strategy, character knowledge, coordination, and teamwork in order to attain victory. Players may use VGS, along with text and voice chat to communicate. A good team will have a balanced choice of classes that will support each other during the game.

"
29754,"Nice game, kinda overwatch"
29755,Best Free to play game like fornite
29756,not as good as insurgency sandstorm
29757,"It is a great game, just like overwatch."
29758,dogshit
29759,pun gas
29760,Fix your servers you cunts
29761,it's okay
29762,noice
29763,"Played it for about 600 hrs, it was great in the public beta phase as some bugs were expected. But  after the launch the game became even more ridden with bugs. Overall a good experience but don't think will play more with newer games coming along."
29764,Yeah
29765,nice
29766,"Always thought of it as a rip-off of overwatch, and, even though it seems like it is, it's also much more than that. Kind of a compilation of good/interesting ideas from different games that ""could work""... And it does, for free.

 Surprisingly fun."
29767,Nice game
29768,gud ga mes i rike it a rot
29769,"Same game mode everytime 
Bots in every server
Dying game ngl¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
29770,"Removed the best feature of the game, what's the point of even playing if no one can see your play of the game. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW HOW LIT I AM!"
29771,"gud game, would play again"
29772,Its a fun game would really recommend
29773,"[b]Better than Overwatch.[/b]
Maeve (=♡ ᆺ ♡=)"
29774,it is fun!
29775,\m/ Pip all the way ;-)
29776,Better than Overwatch.
29777,"The game is fun and addicting and all the champs for the most part are fun to play! However Evil Mojo are a bunch of clowns who wont take time to polish the game, instead all they do half the time is produce skins and fix minor bugs. The performance of the game is either good or horrendous theres rarely any middleground. The game itself would be in a MUCH better state if people who actually cared were in charge.
"
29778,very good game
29779,"Genuinely better than overwatch. Before you comment on this calling me broke, I have played both for over 100 hours each and paladins has more in depth systems. it has good potential but lacks polish in a lot of areas."
29780,predobro jebo vas bog
29781,yeah
29782,"скачал торентом за гроши,теперь лечусь от траяна 
дисслайк"
29783,"Paladins is really fun tbh not going to lie, And to this I only got it cuz yuh boy too poor for overwatch and I though it was a simple overwatch clone. Tho the game has some feature you will find in overwatch it brings it own flare to it through the customization system and the characters are quite unique. The only downfall to paladins would be that there are so character that are broken in the meta right now such as bomb king or zhin and the devs be just dumb with decision making sometimes but overall I would say it is on of my favourite games of all time and a great time killer."
29784,"It's OW but better, and doesn't make me hate myself."
29785,This game is boring! Like Overwatch cheap version!!! LOLL
29786,Nobody is overpowered if everybody is overpowered.
29787,dead game
29788,Idk why I have 18.7 hours in this game. I was only playing with my friend sometimes. Overwatch better
29789,"Well... It is kind of fun, but not if you are a casual player like me. Kids playing 24/7, frag you with one hit, before you even entered the battlefield. 
Playing against bots is too easy and playing against players is too difficult. I sense a high rate of aimbots.

On the plus side: The amount of champions is amazingly high."
29790,PALADINS ? DO U MEAN OVERWATCH ?
29791,"it s a funny game, play it"
29792,If you like being rubber banded all over the place because of garbage servers this game is for you
29793,"easy
"
29794,Nice game
29795,bad
29796,Love it
29797,I always get bot teammates instead of increasing rank im decreasing wtf is this matchmaking and i always gets low tier ppl pls fix this bullcrap
29798,Can i have some point
29799,nice.
